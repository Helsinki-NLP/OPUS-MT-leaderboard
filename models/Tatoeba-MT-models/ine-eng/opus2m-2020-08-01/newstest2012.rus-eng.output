Parliament does not support the amendment that gives freedom to Timoshenko
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine, as amended by the Code of Criminal Procedure, rejected an attempt to repeal the article condemning opposition leader, Julia Timoshenko.
The amendment that would lead to the release of the former Prime Minister ' s prison was rejected during the second reading of the draft Law on the Reduction of Penalties for Economic Offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was considered unfavourable.
The sentence is not final; the court will consider the appeal of Timoshenko in December.
Timoshenko claims that punishment is the political place of the regime; the process has also been suspected in the West.
The proposal to repeal article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, under which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes to be ratified.
Libya’s Victory
In the history of liberation, or resurrection, Libya has already lost.
Muammar Kaddafi was buried somewhere in the desert.
It's time to identify the winners.
Islamists usually win in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a follower of the ordinary Shariat law, which we have already heard.
Libya will become a crime-free country, as the penalty for theft is the cutting of hands.
Women may forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be punished; and so forth.
Instead of the dictator, a society made up of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
In Libya there will be an order that we cannot imagine and which we would hardly wish for.
Whatever the case, our form of life is not the only one in his own family, nor would it be better for us to go to the people of Libya, for example.
In fact, it is surprising that the Islamic fighters received help from the unbelievers.
Their only excuse was that they thought that NATO was leading the U.S. General, not the U.S., but Allah, whose greatness they once praised.
And if Libya is looking for winners, the West is not among them.
We have been involved in shooting, serving Islam, and our policies have escaped from the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantees of benefit.
Given the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to renounce Libya's military occupation.
The local population should therefore not be concerned about the expulsion of “crestors”.
Even if the oil companies are not occupied, will they get Libya's black gold for almost no price?
Probably won't, and then the West will finally be able to resort to useless civil rights protection.
Unless the followers of the Sharia don't put an end to this.
A new wave of crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe are at the heart of investors.
The statistical storm passed over Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries reported GDP data in 3 quarters.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy has remained stable, Germany and France have demonstrated growth.
Still, today's debt market is on record.
Investors are no longer looking only at Italy; they are now focusing on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have published their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP rose by 0.5 per cent; France by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries also adjusted data for the second quarter, where the case was better than expected in Germany (growth by 0.3 per cent instead of original 0.1 per cent). France reported a slight decrease by 0.1 per cent (significant information suggested stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, compared with the previous quarter of GDP, the Czech Statistical Office confirmed the trend of gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than predicted by the analysts.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent; however, it remained stable compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany ' s economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
From July to September, both the eurozones and the European Union have shown growth compared to the previous quarter of 0.2 per cent, which is similar to the analytical projections.
Greece ' s economy showed a preliminary drop of 5.2 per cent.
The income of its 10-year bonds is 28.45 per cent.
Income from both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching critical.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
Despite the worsening situation in the region, the Czech 1-year bond income remains about 4 per cent.
In Germany, it is said that the ECB is the last creditor to save the situation.
The Assembly of the Czech Republic has been selected in EURO.
In Montenegro, they won the 1:0 and will celebrate an unexpected cash prize of 200 million.
The national team has successfully completed the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Czech Republic and the beautiful face of Peter Iráchek, they won the 1:0 account.
In the second time, the Czech team was lucky to maintain a considerable advantage after the home-responsive match and will again participate in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the match and made a detailed report.
Almost nothing remarkable in the first time and a great success in the second.
The Czech National Assembly, partly because of the defeat of the team at the end; the Great Czech Republic; and the heroic Iraq; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated the European Championship.
The Czech team's outstanding defense allowed the Montenegro team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damianovic and Vucinic became the most unsuccessful match couple after they missed two magnificent opportunities.
Great Peter Chech is one of the reasons that the Czech National Assembly won't miss the European Championship next year, and the Czech football thus earns about 200 million Czech crowns.
From the first minute the game was very tense.
Both teams had difficulty in conducting combinations; most of the time the game went to the center of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the team of first-time owners, and further attacks on the line of defense were accurately intercepted by the Czech defenders.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred university students have built a living shield around the nuclear power station in Iran.
They therefore wish to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday, at noon, the students ’ prayers before entering the building were followed by a request for both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students have built a living shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
They thus demonstrated their willingness to protect their country ' s nuclear programme for their own lives.
In its last report, the International Agency for Nuclear Energy (IAEA) indicated that it had all demonstrated that Iran had not allowed attempts to obtain nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday, at the students ’ prayers before entering the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant, both the U.S. and Israel were followed by a request for death.
In the event of an attack aimed at maximizing the Iranian nuclear programme, the Israeli press will aim to install both in Isfahan and in Natanze, where uranium enrichment is being carried out.
Question of children suffering from obesity: No breakfast and dinner sausage
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 are subject to higher standards; while 9 per cent of schoolchildren are overweight, 5% are overweight.
According to the latest study, children who suffer from obesity usually come from families that are ill - treated.
We once again see the importance of the environment and the patterns of behavior associated with a person for his or her healthy development.
For example, sausages appear on the tables of children who suffer from obesity almost twice as often as in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of children with obesity eat free potatoes before a survey of the educational event called Obstetrics is not an accident.
Moreover, children who suffer from obesity are not involved in sports; however, most families of modern schoolchildren - only 15 per cent of them said that their parents had time to engage in sports at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of last year's school year, with nearly 900 primary students attending all over Bohemia.
This event was not a second year in the order, with the support of the insurance company General Health Insurance and Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 students from 4-8 classes have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and adequate sports load are key determinants of the rapidly increasing number of children suffering from either overweight or obesity.
"For example, only half of the respondents said that they ate five times a day, according to the breakfast-perekus-lanch-perekus-food scheme, which is one of the essential conditions of proper nutrition," says one study.
No chain and no sausage for dinner.
Experts warn that even relative details such as regular family breakfast are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 per cent of school families are eating together.
In most families, everyone is hungry separately.
The worst opening has been that in every ten families, people do not have breakfast at all.
But breakfast is the foundation of the right daily routine.
The study showed that burning food is more common in families with children who suffer from obesity.
Almost every person - regardless of weight - drinks sweet drinks every day (70 per cent).
Although more than 40 per cent of children are regularly involved in sports, this figure is reduced by more than twice, up to 15 per cent, when it comes to their parents.
Build your own menu.
In another part of the study for selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) it was proposed to draw up their own menu based on the products proposed and based on their tastes and preferences.
"Evidence in food in Czech children 12-15 years of age far from ideal for healthy nutrition."
Their favorite food includes a large number of painful, meaty, and sweet dishes.
“A particular concern is the high popularity of sweet drinks”, says the final part of the study.
As the main part of the meal, the shepherd beats a bird with a small overhang.
However, the children were practically not interested in beans, fish, and vegetables.
Stimulation to a Healthy Form of Life
The study also showed that children were willing to change their eating habits, provided that relevant information was provided to them.
"Many participants in the monitoring group have shown a significant increase in the preference for healthy food when they completed the survey after the lecture " .
This was particularly noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet drinks, more children began to prefer simple water.
In addition, children were more likely to mention birds and fish, limiting the number of sweets and boils.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, professionals say
In the first article on training for the stylists, I visited information at introductory sessions.
I had no idea what was going to happen.
Three experts ' lessons in this area; advice on the choice of clothing for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how all of this works in real life.
Here's more.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
Training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really filled with information.
This time, we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not ideally symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
On one short neck, on the other little figure with no proper shape, one is more of a norm.
The stylist should know how to visually reduce the broad shoulders, extend the neck or add the missing volumes.
We have been given advice on how to highlight the figure of women such as Jennifer Lopes, that is, the owners of a cleaner chest and thigh and tight waistline, and not to wear them too challenging.
For example, if the difference in size of the waist and thigh is so great that it is not possible to improve the waist or thighs, there should be at least one thing on the order.
You're obviously not going to regret the money you've invested, because the ideal sitting clothes are worthless.
You will feel much better in the beauty of the order than in the one who keeps on going, is squeezing, enlarging, and so on.
The owners of small figures, on the other hand, may wear clothing with rivets, application, lifting or bearings.
Given the abundance of such information and types of figures, I'm glad I've got all week to realize that.
But I'm afraid that's too much, given the homework we got.
Each participant had to think of two arrangements for some celebrity: day and night.
We must take into account their modern appearance, their style in clothing and the type of figure.
I need to wear Miranda Kerr, which you can know about Victoria's Secret advertising campaigns.
I'm glad to wear it much easier than, say, Britney Spears, Christina Agiler, who's recently made up her tones (please let me know I'm too proud), or even a young Selenna Gomez.
We need to cut out or find clothes on the Internet, print and process using graphic programs.
Mudboard - so called the result of the work - then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphic image.
It is important to keep in mind the graphic style.
The stylist not only wears real people but creates product pages in magazines (based on special instructions, such as fashion bags, coat, etc.).
That's what the designer and designer Mario Kamenick told us.
But it was only on Sunday.
The Stylist needs general knowledge
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about the types of figures, has brought three visitors to life in this area.
Stylist, Honza Pokorna; fashion designer, Jacob Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist can use one object of clothing differently.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, you can wear your coat-suit in a normal way, on the top of your jeans and shoes, like your coat; but you can also wear it on your naked body, without your feet, like a plate.
Another option is to hit the handle or lift the spine, and the whole image completely changes.
"Play with him," he stressed.
Anyway, I appreciated the following advice: "For your work you must know the rules perfectly."
Then you can start breaking 'em,' Jacob told us.
I finally figured out why we're going to collect all the definitions and rules that we're going to combine with what and why, while we often see something else in modern magazines.
I'm not talking about fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I knew that the stylist should have more options than the number of photos he needs to take.
Yes, for a modern review on ten pages (equivalent to ten sets) I have to be ready to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that the object of clothing often looks and works in conjunction with others completely different from reality.
We must have that in mind when we create an image.
Honza Pokorna confirmed that the image and style are often half successful.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have a devastating vocal, but her image and marketing turned her into a world star.
The attitude towards the services of stylists in the Czech Republic remains rather cold.
Even well-known people often think that this is too much (and believe that it is enough to be a specialist in something, and what they look like is secondary).
And if anyone allows us to create them, we should wait for them to call us something less than what they really have.
Then we go to Google and find out if we haven't written a tabloid about something that's some sort of semi-trailer or something.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that the stylist did not understand enough in fashion and that he was able to improve at once.
Our work mainly consists of communication with the people we dress; therefore, it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to appreciate people, not to create them, and to stick to their views.
"If the manager asks you to look at her clothes and add some beautiful things, you can't throw out her entire wardrobe, tell her that her clothes are terrible."
"Find at least a few things you can praise, and advise what you can carry with them," says Mario.
He also showed us that the work bag should be replaced specifically.
It's the bag you tie around the waist to carry everything you need.
In addition to obvious things, such as knives, sticky rolls or English beads, it should contain nylon thread (stylists use it in the collection of some items, such as bags or pencils), special clips to strengthen the back fabric if it wears too much (bolts and similar items are prohibited because they wear clothes) or a set for sewing.
To get away from the lessons and get some practical experience, we learned to do the right thing.
Even during surveys in a study where half-slows can get damage - not to mention street surveys.
And here we are.
You don't have to touch the shoe with knives to keep them out.
This requires this mastership.
I was glad that Mario praised my work.
The above - mentioned skills did not touch my heart.
This is just part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend.
I'm starting to realize that being a professional stylist isn't as easy as talking.
V Need for Speed: Escape takes place in America.
Review
What was supposed to be a carefree walk turned into a routine morning trip to work due to a series of completely inappropriate and non-illegal mistakes.
The ambitions were to some extent satisfied, but it was not important, since no one was clearly willing to do any unnecessary work.
Before the release of the new version with the heading "Run" there was a great deal of hope.
It was expected that it would move the previous series of Need For Speed in a new direction; the demonstration versions showed that the game would take a dignified place in the genre of hunting games.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main hero left the car and ran away.
As is often the case with NFS, there is a lot different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the general impression is that there are several unnecessary errors that have been present in this series for several years.
And that means it's not really a mistake, it's an unexplained line of developers.
The adventure is starting very well.
You're becoming part of a story that Jack, the main hero, decides to solve some personal problems by participating in an illegal race through America.
You're sitting in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your task is to get to New York first.
There are a number of interesting features in this thought.
The route consists of ten stages divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race goes on its own path, the individual stages go on in a diverse and interesting environment.
So there is no feeling that the game is always the same.
Although the schedule is at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, some tracks are pleasant to watch.
Yet, the game does not produce strong emotions.
While driving through the desert, it is very pleasant to ride through the autumn meadows or high in snowy mountains.
In addition, the race is time - consuming.
For example, in the desert, you fall into a sandstorm, which is significantly diminishing visibility.
On the other hand, the mountains need to be careful not to fall under a ladder.
The individual races are pretty well arranged.
There are only a few varieties, but that's enough.
For a while you're trying to win a few rivals (in fact a normal race); then you're trying to improve time (the standard run with a second) or you're running with one opponent.
Besides, from time to time, you've come to the police, which makes your task even more difficult.
The components outside the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation where most of Jack's time is running away from someone and you have to help him with the buttons needed at the right time.
It's okay.
Although it is surprising that these fragments are much less than you could expect (all three to be accurate).
In fact, it turns out to be good for the game because it doesn't have to; given all the above, it's one of the things that makes the game more interesting.
The hunting model follows the previous models.
This means that it no longer constitutes something special, but it cannot be regarded as a lack.
If you're looking for a real life simulation, you're going to have to find another place.
However, this model of driving is very suitable for dynamic driving, although better options can be found on the market.
It's all right.
However, some time has passed since problems began.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not so good.
You don't expect complex changes and clashes from this game, but if you don't have the idea of facing the object, how your car will behave, something is not like that.
Usually, when you drive or walk past a car in a smooth stream, you sometimes easily relate to another car, but sometimes in a somewhat similar situation your car starts to get distracted.
Or it's broken.
It's not so important because of the restart system, but it's enough to make fun.
The startups are set in such a way that if you break or walk away from the track, the game will bring you back to the point where it was interrupted.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use them all, you'll have to start the race from the start.
It's useful if something isn't achieved, but you can't totally rely on it.
Sometimes restarts are not enough, and you have to learn to run over a particular race area.
An important lack of play is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some rotations need to take place in a certain way, otherwise you just don't enter.
In other cases, you meet civilian cars at a certain location in the same configuration regardless of whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations where you see your opponent passing easily between two machines moving in the opposite direction, while when you are there, the machines are already in place so you need to either drive them or drop them.
It doesn't matter when you're around them; it's all arranged in such a way that the situation always happens just before your nose.
There are other advantages to the rivals.
During the game you find several places where, regardless of the time, the same rival is driving you to the same place.
This is especially evident at the end of the game, on the long bridge where you go in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent must stand before you in spite of anything.
It's because when he walks in front of you, he's making your review worse, leading to one or more accidents on this site.
You can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and filled with adrenaline, but it's so obvious that it's soon starting to provoke anger.
Sorry, because despite a simple driving model, the game is busy and sometimes so filled with events that you don't have time to pay attention to what's happening around you.
It doesn't matter what doesn't make you miss -- the concept with fifty unique tracks, the sequence of chases or something else.
The idea of changing cars during the race is unusual.
You need to track the repairs along the way, because that's exactly what your car can do, even though in most cases what you already have is enough.
Machines are divided into three categories.
Sporting machines approach cities; powerful American machines are for direct cuts of the show; and exotic super-sports for technical management, for example, on paved mountain trails.
The main story mode mode is closely related to the challenge mode mode; it is race on individual areas that you will know about the game.
Here you win for your personal business both medals and glasses, common to the regimes of challenges and stories.
Many options are available to achieve a higher level of driving: starting from cars and ending the profile data.
In addition, the profile is related to the Autolog online function, which, in addition, compares the results you have achieved with the results of other players, and makes contact with the public.
There is another flaw that is hard to understand; it is an example from the last race in sequence.
You and your car fall into the subway tunnel (we'll think you're doing it) where you're going on the tracks in the dark (we'll think you're doing it).
Your speedometer shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (we'll assume so) when you suddenly get hit by a subway train, turning your car into a metal chest.
For a few days, our editor discussed whether no one really thought for a second at the time of the creation of the game, or what its creators really think of us as such.
The technical composition of the games is nothing special; but the general impression from the video rectangle is most pleasant, sometimes even surprising.
Unfortunately, at some critical times, the quality of the record is sometimes relatively low.
This is particularly true of incidents with a large number of participants, where a good record would also not help you in particular.
Sound all right; soundtrack -- the lover.
In order to satisfy the widest possible youth audience, the soundtrack 'composed from different styles' has come out; but hardly many people buy a game because of its music.
General impression of Need for Speed: Running quite smoothly.
If the game was to avoid the obvious unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that Escape is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
In any case, the game leaves a feeling of incompleteness.
Of course, it's a good time, but be prepared to be blinded by the shortcomings of the airport's prospector.

Ambassador to the EU Vicenova:
The Czechs have a reputation of non-beneficiaries and skeptics with respect to the euro.
“The Lisbon Treaty has caused considerable differences between individual organizations.”
"I didn't expect such a cruel war."
"It takes five or six years before the situation is even stabilized, calmed and all players are used to their new roles," Ambassador Milena Vicenov of the EU began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She demonstrated how well she adhered to her “Clear and Open Europe” motto in the first part of her lecture, where she described individual EU institutions and their relations so simply and clearly that many lecturers from the Faculty of Law would be envious.
Moreover, Vicenova praised the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompey:
“In the beginning, critics have said that he is an ordinary office mouse that cannot play any role; I have to say, everything has been struck with how well he has done with his role.”
"The person who can listen at the same time to the twenty-seven participating countries is very good at communicating with them and who has a clear view of which side the EU needs to develop."
She explained her new position as a representative on international relations and security issues as a response to the question: "Who is the European Union? What number do I need to call?", that is, how important a step towards the unification and greater transparency of the Union ' s policies towards countries such as China and India.
No one's going to ban our pigs.
The evaluation continued to focus on the EU's key programme in the past, the present and the near future.
It called for the successful Czech presidency last year.
The Czechs were dealing with the emerging financial crisis; they were overcoming the crisis and organized the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She said that the Government ' s resignation at that time was a negative phenomenon that had caused minor damage to the Czech Republic.
The representatives of the Czech Republic are currently very busy in the EU.
As the Ambassador said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis were causing a continuing number.
In addition, a new seven-year EU budget needs to be adopted, which is very difficult in view of the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be modest and economical, which areas will be preferred; which countries will receive more support and which countries will receive less; all these issues will be in the forthcoming programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans she brought to Brussels: "O Europe, the Language of Understanding."
"I really don't like discounts, foreign words and jargon that no one understands.
How citizens can understand that people in Brussels are not trying to sell curves or round beads, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our kind of cheese."
It is also going to make more effective use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs into European organizations.
Multi-speed Europe - our future
The Ambassador argues that the Czechs are considered Euro-Species; as well as people who note the more negative but not the positive side of the matter.
She wanted more representatives of the Czech Republic to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that several factors are involved: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write explanatory letters; at the same time, with little support from the Czech side.
Together with the successful Czech presidency, it noted the power and cooperation of the Vishgrad Group.
"Make sure that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and we have a word, the French next to me says, 'Hey, what about the assembly again, the Upper City Group?' and he doesn't like the hats.
In the future, the Vicenova Union is looking forward to a largely new set of rules for the budgetary policies of States parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considers the idea of two-speed unless Europe is more realistic.
"We have countries both inside and outside the Eurozone."
"We have a Schengen area, and we already have an institution of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it has been said that countries that want to unite, while those that do not want to can remain side by side."
"The number of such institutions will grow; it will be a two-speed Europe," Vicenova expects.
In this regard, it stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompey in advancing the rule that all issues relating to the whole EU should be discussed by all countries parties, not only those entering the Eurozone.
Brand history:
The new IBM is entering the second century of its existence.
If anyone wants to find a word that best expresses the strategy of the IMB, the closest probably will be "longevity".
For the general public IBM is a symbol of a technological revolution; the company is considered to be very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The company's longevity was set by its first boss, dreamer Thomas J. Watson.
He believed in his currency that many of the world’s problems could easily be solved if people wanted to think.
His slogan "Dumai!" thus became a stamp that had developed around the life of the future giant (and the name of his internal magazine, which IMB started publishing in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson had carefully built.
"For us in IBM, long-term thinking means constant movement to the future.
IBM survived and flourished for a hundred years because it remained faithful to its original values, although it was not afraid to change everything around itself.
In our first hundred years, this allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years we hope to achieve even more," says current manager Samuel J. Palmizano on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complex system
In the 1930s, Watson came to the issue of employees like Batya in the Czech Republic - IMB employees were one of the first American employees with paid leave, employer insurance, elegant uniform and complex bonus system for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
The same is the case with long-term IBM relations with consumers.
From the very beginning, the company has had a brilliant application to talented people, one of the first world companies to eliminate all discrimination, which has given it a great choice.
It agrees with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan that the woman, Virginia Rometti, will change Palmizano next year.
She worked in IBM for thirty years; she is currently the sales, marketing and development director.
For the past few years IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorms, during which many future innovations occur.
It's not surprising that many ideas work in companies around half a million people.
Organization with a good reputation
The company's strong position in business is provided with a strong internal and external image.
"From the very beginning, from the point of view of IBM was rather an organization rather than a technological company," said Professor of Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosabet Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it's a company that helps solve technology business problems," adds George Colony from Forrester Research Consultant.
As they say in the company itself, there is a difference between going to the market and creating it.
For a hundred years IBM, or the Blue Giant, as it is called in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It is believed that it is the most universal technology company, which develops equipment and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services, from servers to nanotechnology.
It has the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, and five of its staff have received the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, a ATM, a bank card, a financial soap, a strike-code and a diskette.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization, IBM has become the second technology company this year (first place in Apple), which has been the first time since 1996.
Look forward
Not all of its products were tasted by buyers and entered the era. For example, IBM failed its OS/2 operating system; Prodigy online service and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is determined by moving forward, you cannot be emotionally attached to the past," says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why IBM is easily based on several platforms -- if they don't work, she's giving up.
This distinguishes it, for example, from its Microsoft competitor, who builds and survives down on Windows, his operating system.
Perspective technology
The main IBM revenues are derived from services, about one fifth in each case from computer programs and hardware.
As in 1990, with capital twice as much, it was the strongest equipment company.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets of $15 billion, while investing 58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis struck the world for the first time.
IBM is an example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment in the years of the Great Depression.
Until now IBM seems to have done no harm to the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the IBM share price has increased by 120 per cent; the company ' s net earnings have increased continuously.
The corporate currency of IBM is to change everything but its own values.
It can therefore be expected that even if another crisis occurs, this flexible giant will be able to cope with the situation.
The history of IBM: from the raw knife to spaceflights.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago.
She named IBM in 1924, originally called the brand used for company offices in Canada and South America.
The foundations of the future IBM were founded by a merger of four companies whose history began in the 1880s.
They owned technologies, such as legendary “table hours”, that is, fixed times when staff came and left work.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlet Flint, a businessman, who was also the head of the company’s board of supervisors until 1930.
Flint hired a rival company director, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then rejected the founder of IBM as a shadow - Watson's ideas remain the basis for an unforgivable corporate culture and individuality.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as it is clear from the name, began from the production and sale of various equipment for the business - from raw knives and meat from cassette machines.
The first four years of Watson's leadership doubled to $9 million, and a large expansion of the company to all continents began.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later his seat in the board of directors took his son, Thomas Watson, the youngest.
Under his leadership IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and established the first programming language.
In 1960, both staff and IBM computers helped NASA to control space flights - on Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 - human flights to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first IBM line system/360.
The classic PC, which established computer standards at that time, called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the Chinese company Lenovo's computers, while purchasing PricewaterhouseCoopers' Consulting Office, thus focusing fully on high-value consultancy and services.
In the last three years, IBM has achieved great success with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its objective is to make reasonable use of technologies in areas where this has not yet been planned and to improve the road situation and urban management.
In the area of trade IBM has recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps businessmen control the entire trade cycle.
IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe, IBM established its office in 1932.
Today IBM CZ is also managing the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters of Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, where a world-class research group is also working.
Rittarge about his unfaithful husband:
Iveta, you fool, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richtarzhov (53) said it's over!
After her husband, Joseph Richtarge (53), became a bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartošova (45), Darina still hoped that he would get back home.
Nevertheless, she no longer wants to wait, and she has marked clear rules for her future life.
"Peppa can come home, but not as my partner anymore," explains Richtarjov.
When Darina Richtarzhov gave her blood to Bartošova in summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
Although she had Yvette leave Rhichan 30 days later, Pepa did not leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly acknowledged his love for her.
After some time, Darina gave up, made a remark that she had calmed down with her husband; and now she finally forgave him.
I don't care who his wife was sleeping with.
Even if Richtar and Bartošov were ever to break up, his wife would not accept him with extended promises.
"He's my son's biological father, and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one's gonna drive him away."
"He will end his days, not like my beloved, lost and found old fool, but the man with whom I am bound," said Richtarjov, adding that she has already been freed from her husband and insists only on mutual appearances.
As long as Joseph had nothing to do with his wife rejecting him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Yveta, I'm not going to change it."
"My wife decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision."
"Our union is still working; I'm responsible for repair, garden, house and shopping."
"Darina and I communicate perfectly well, only we don't share the bed anymore," Richtarge told Blake.
He claims that if Richtarjov finds new love, he won't interfere with it.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who and if she has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Yvette, and I have full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
What, are they talking about you?
When you ask men to name some typical bad women habits, they usually immediately list them all.
Ladies and gentlemen, do you know yourself in the following lines that describe a few women's habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Your second half complains that you're always going to the shops?
You need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like shopping for big sales?
If so, your shopping can be considered a stupid habit.
Some women admit that they have to control their passion for shopping.
Yet which of you will give up a walk in the marketplaces in search of an ideally seated garment and an example of it (if any, in different color options) in exemplary style?
Maybe shopping is a hobby for most women, but for men it can be a real hell.
Just remember how many times you told your second half to wait outside...
Eternal Dissatisfaction
"I'm too fat?"
"I have to drop at least five kilograms -- maybe I'll start doing gymnastics?"
"You're still coming to me?"
Do you know these phrases?
Yeah?
Then you are part of a group of women who are intertwined in their appearance.
Not that you need to stop watching yourself, but many men literally have an allergy to the constant complaints of their partners in their external appearance.
The strong gender also agrees with the fact that the more complaints are made, the more women are angry with them.
The Most Important Order and Purity
It's like an endless story.
The soft glass, the cleaning of dust, the mud, the spraying of dust, the cleaning of the bath--at least twice a week.
You're criticizing your partner for coming to a clean coffee shop in dirty bottles; the kids for the sin in clean handkerchiefs and fingerprints on the window glass in the hotel that was so hard to clean?
If you are suffering from this “deviation”, try to realize that it is very bad to fall into; and that order and purity in your family should not be the first.
A sincere desire to be clean may threaten your relationship as well as your whole family.
Intended command
"Put the white in the basket."
"Are you going to wear dirty legs tomorrow?"
"The floor coverings for containers should not be on the floor."
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, he may find it very compelling.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood it, women wouldn't have to command it so often...
Split
Some women like to gossip, insult, and gossip about others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, with whom, and why.
From time to time, each of us is likely to break free.
Let us be open, so visible to all women.
Whatever the case, there are more serious clashes, women who often clash and despise others, and they, especially in the women's working group, pose a major danger to their environment.
The results of Jagra and Voracek's transfers helped Philadelphia win
During the NHL match on Monday, two successful transfers of the hockey attacker Jaromir Jagra helped Philadelphia defeat 5:3 on the island of Karolina, and he again became the most successful Czech player in the match.
In both cases, Claude Gyru used the experience of a thirty - nine - year - old star; he added another one and was announced by the best player.
Two successful match transfers also belonged to the player in one team with Jagre Jakob Voracek.
After the match, Jagrets told foreign journalists that he had predicted the Great Night for the jury.
"I told him before the match he was gonna kill a hettrick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel that kind of thing," Jagr explained, after which Jiru killed the target at the first opportunity that Fliers gave.
Shortly thereafter, the second goal of the team was also “the Czech trail”.
The closing Harrikeans Vorachek captured the show and handed it over to Max Talbot, who killed between the circles.
In a second before the first break of the home game, Patrick Dwiveer reduced the break in many ways, but at the beginning of the second time, Flyers again took it.
Especially the jury.
After his successful release, Jagra killed the third target, and was subsequently turned into the fourth target by Wayne Simmonds.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean to say that he's the best game of the league, but he's exactly in the three best," said Jagr, commending his central.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"That makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in the NHL, my teammates have been trying to help me, and now my turn has come," Jagr added.
Caroline made the match more dramatic with the help of Tuomo Routu and the Dwyer Penalties, reducing the gap to one goal.
Further complications prevented Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
"Pronger worked well in our area."
"He hit the show, I'm in a hurry, and Reed's gone to the far end."
"I was glad it worked," Voracek described his impression from the last goal of the match.
The victory led Philadelphia to its first place in the Eastern Conference.
The defender of the Montreal Czech team Yaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo; he left the game during the second period due to injury to the upper part of the body.
Along with an experienced defender, Canadians lost their two-point advantage and lost 2:3 after a series of penalties.
Thomas Pleicant was unable to kill during one of their attacks.
More than the lost eyes, the home coach was upset by the large number of injuries in the back row, since the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
"We've finished the match with only one experienced player, the rest were young people."
"No matter what, we can't do anything about it, we just need to calm down," said Jacques Martin.
"In exchange for replacement, it was devastating and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the show from our zone."
"What was our weak side," added the defender P.K.Subban
After the thirtieth attack by the Czech superintendent, Onjay Pavelez helped Winnipeg win Tampa Bay 5:2.
The Golls, who had interrupted the five-month series of defeats, were killed by five different players.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Up to 1989, only five public tourist agencies were able to work in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
Since travel to the West was severely restricted, tourist agencies at that time mainly sold tours to the socialist bloc.
Thus, Czech tourists traveled to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime returned to the West, which resulted in considerable restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The greater paradox of the socialist period was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed individual visits to socialist countries.
If a Czechoslovak citizen wanted to go on his own, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, an invitation from that country was necessary; another individual travel was impossible.
At the time, tourist agencies offered trips to the West, but they had to either stand up all night with a sleeping bag or have "good friends" in the agency.
And that wasn't all.
A currency permit was needed for a trip to the West, and it was not issued to politically untrustworthy people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; it was impossible to obtain money (Western currency) for a trip to the West without a currency.
Most of the Czechs have taken their vacation home, which has resulted in a large number of cats and summer homes, and this habit is still today.
Since 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic has thus survived the current revolution.
While before 1989, leave in GDR or Bulgaria was the culmination of our travels, Czechs spent 4.5 million leave in countries around the world last year.
The great paradox that we no longer realize is that by 1989 we could not freely visit Croatia's most popular at present, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of 1990, the need for visas in the neighbouring Western European countries had been lifted, and this was the beginning of a huge wave of short journeys mainly in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks couldn't have taken any trips to the West, and they all wanted to go there for a while.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents, since their income at the time did not catch up with the hotel or the pension.
A typical feature of Czech tourism during that period was the desire to bring their own food (conservations, salads, etc.) to save money.
Another important moment is the introduction of a freely converted Czech crown. After decades our tourists can finally buy the Western currency.
Our standard of living and our average income grew, leading to another important situation in 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has enabled tourist agencies to prepare regular flights carried out by charter airlines; compared to the past, aircraft have now become incredibly cheap thanks to the possibility of ordering discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs did not need a visa to visit almost all developed world countries except the United States, which made our travels even easier.
The next major event in the history of post-revolution journeys took place in 2000. The greater demand led to the historic first direct charter trip from the Czech Republic to the exotic country of Thailand.
Since then, direct charter travels have been carried by Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, and this winter flight from the Czech Republic will take place on twelve exotic routes.
Currently, some 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another important event of this period, symbolizing our development after the revolution, occurred in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States abolished the need for visas for Czech tourists, and our country has therefore always acceded to the most developed countries.
For the first time in history in 2008, Czechs spent more than half their holidays abroad (50.3 per cent); and for the first time in history they spent more than 15,000 kroner per person during vacation abroad, including their expenses in the destination paragraph.
The General Assembly must elect a President, the threat of return
There was no president for about five months in Czech football; there was a risk that Ivan Gašek, the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) would not be called even after another extraordinary general meeting to be held in Nimburg on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on what electoral rules to follow.
Without that vote, one of the three candidates will not begin.
Yindrazhi Reichle, Miroslav Pelta and Tomash Pazlik want to lead Czech football.
Gasek left his post in June, leaving, he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong person who would lead football in the future.
However, Gasheka's era re-embarked football between the two chambers of an association that cannot choose one candidate.
This was clearly 16 September when the new President was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly had come to the National House in Prague, Smileov, because the negotiations had remained blocked, not only by the electoral procedure.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote at the general meeting -- only legal representatives or also officials who had been authorized.
Since then, it has been partially resolved through the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law that a delegation based on authority cannot be made possible.
Disputes concerning electoral rules, however, continue.
The Executive Board also did not help too much, although in its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it was mainly a matter of concern.
The views on voting methods have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is, how do we get to round 3 and avoid the road?
“The difference is whether to follow the rules or find another model,” says one of the vice-presidents of FACHR Dushan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
Based on the model provided for by the Charter, the winner of the round 3rd is the candidate who has received much support from the chamber from which he is a candidate.
Moravia is alleged to agree with the compromise - to be the winner of the candidate ' s election with the highest number of votes cast in both chambers.
The Czech side insists that the winner should vote at least two thirds in the overall percentage.
"Nonetheless, the two previous rounds would have lost their meaning; it would have completely denied the concept of two chambers," Freedom agrees with Moravia's arguments, saying that it would be better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with the existing rules.
A few surprises, Tomash Pazlik agrees with him, although according to estimates of the electoral rules set out in the Charter, Pelta is more than other candidates.
"I'd like the elections to go as far as the constitution is concerned."
"I want to avoid all sorts of representational nonsense, as in the previous general assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who was the first candidate; and in his statements he was mainly opposed to Pelte.
Pelta's still an optimist.
He believed that the new president would become known in Nimburg; he also hoped that candidates would cooperate constructively in the future.
"All the emotional strain will calm down after today's expected national rally at the European Championship."
"The football will be happy again, people will be more willing to cooperate," said the representative of Jablonec.
Rachel's got more hold.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very different."
"It's not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to adapt the rules."
"It may cause another general assembly to break."
"I hope it makes sense," said Rachel.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach agreement.
According to some information, some negotiations have been conducted directly in Montenegro; but who knows whether football unity will be achieved before the match.
An additional trip, which was to be delivered to Podgorica by the Vice-Presidents of Dalibor Kücher and Reichla, did not come out of Prague in the morning due to technical error; they requested an alternative to bring part of the executive committee to the venue of the re-playing match.
Finally, the ministerial meeting, which is expected to be held on Wednesday, can be crucial.
Minister of Education, Youth and Sport, Joseph Dobesh, would like the opposition parties to the country's strongest sports association to enter into an agreement.
There are many: government grants; football credit; and the planned CSTV general meeting with the new Czech Sports Directorate after the financial problems of Sazka.
Pazlik entered the presidential struggle because he did not see an appropriate candidate
If, before the extraordinary general meeting, the head of footballers, Plzeň Tomas Pazlik, had seen a strong candidate who would have met all his requirements to the President of the Czech Football Association (FACHR), he would not have even claimed a high position.
"If I were a worthy candidate, I would fight for him and not take part in the fight myself."
"But such a man has not yet been found," said Paclik ČTK.
The reason for Paclica's entry into the fight against Miroslav Pelta and Yindrich Reich - to try to prevent Pelta, the supposed favourite of the elections, from entering the FAČR.
In addition, Paclik emphasizes that in the event of a victory, he will remain President only until 2013, when a regular general meeting is planned.
In the future, he would like this post to be taken over by an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football.
"I've talked to a few people that could be considered."
"It was horrible for me to hear some of them say they don't even want to talk about Czech football at the moment."
"I'd like to change that opinion," he said.
At present, the main disagreement between Paclica and Pelta is related to the relationship between the last Roman Berbrom, the president of the Pulsen regional football association. Berber is a man of conflicting reputation, known as an influential lobbyist who is able to influence the votes of delegates of the universal assembly.
Paclik thus considered it unacceptable that Pelta should become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged and football will not move forward."
"With Berbra's support, a capable businessman, it would be even more harmful for football," said Paclik.
He argues that Pelta's name was recorded a few years ago during a phone interview in the case of corruption; Pelte was able to avoid sentences.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta's victory would bring."
"And what we would look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Pazlik.
If Paclik won on Thursday, he could cooperate with Pelta in the future.
This opinion is shared by another candidate, Rachel, whom Paclik supported before the general meeting in September, which ended in the fiasco.
"He would be the first to be approached."
'He's very capable.'
"I can present it in the head of the assembly."
"But he can't run an association."
"I don't have my nose in what I don't understand," said Paclik, who drew a lot of attention to himself in September, when he supported the removal of the judicial brigade led by Man Macel, whom Dagmar Damkova replaced.
Paclik claims he will risk managing the association.
He referred to his experience in managing private companies; last summer he was led by a team of Plzeň, who with his help celebrated his first victory in the League in May.
"I have the strength to make the football environment change, to support its change for the better."
"Limiting the influence of some groups of people who are willing to influence the disciplinary and appeals board, which leads to repulsive situations," said Pazlik, who does not conceal his antipathy, for example, to the Director of Sparta Daniel Krjetinski.
One of its priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between FACHR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which it will lobby at the highest political level to allocate more money to sports from lottery fees.
"This is one of the key points that the new President must deal with."
"If gambling is taxed, as the political parties say, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly state where the money is going," he said.
Pazlik does not consider his relationship with the Plzeň Club to be a burden, although he argues that President FAČR should be independent.
Pelta's connected to the apple tree, and Rachel's with the Prague Doklo.
"It's not an ideal option."
"But I don't see any sense in the hypocritical transfer of my shares to someone else at the same time as I'm going back there six months," Pazlik says.
Pelta promised new FAČR rules that would help avoid the electoral path
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if chosen, he would fight for new FACHR rules in order to avoid disputes about election rules in the future.
Prior to Thursday ' s negotiations in Nimbour, the official of Applenice remains optimistic and believes that attention from the pre-election struggle will be a tangible reflection of the expected success of our football rally today.
Prior to the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus both on representation and on receiving funds.
He decided to take part in the elections at the last moment before the last general meeting, and the two-month delay could thus have been useful for him to resist his ideas about football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been at football for a long time, and they expect the president to be known on Thursday."
“They feel that it is time for someone to take the lead in the association,” claims a man primarily associated with the Apple Club; but he spent many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the association.
This gives him reason to assume that he is experienced enough to manage Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the euphoria that reigned during the reign of Ivan Gashek.
“Unfortunately, the rules that were not as complete as we all thought were adopted at the June general meeting.”
"If different methods of representation had not been adopted, we would already have been president by September," Pelta said.
It refers to the rewriting of the civil association ' s key document as a false purpose for delegates.
"If I become President, I will consider it my personal task, and I will assume my personal responsibility if this attempt is unsuccessful."
"It's a fundamental question that we can't exist without," says Pelta.
In addition, he says he's not trying to stand up for his rivals.
In the past, he had already stated that he could present his cooperation with Yindraži Reich, whom he appreciated for legal education; he fully recognized the fact that his rival candidate should become his first vice-president.
For a long time, he did not attack Thomas Pazlik, who was constantly criticizing Pelta.
"He's been on football for over a year and has achieved some success."
"No matter what, his attacks were inappropriate, and many people were amazed at his pre-election campaign."
"And that is why some of them are now in doubt about his true personality," said Pelta about his rival, and Pelta himself claims to be faithful to the declarations he announced in September.
He considered his main weapons knowledge of football, from low-level competitions to national assembly.
The national assembly must represent all the football.
"I would also try to put an end to all incidents, starting with the case of rich people or the consequences of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would then focus on negotiations with both the private and the public sectors to guarantee a sufficient amount of money for the whole football," the forty-six-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He then promised that his election as a football leader would not lead to staff dismissal.
"I will need to know the official instructions of individual staff members." This was his message to Insurance, where the extended period of inter-government is a source of considerable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios associated with the planned general meeting, he believed that on Thursday, delegates would not come to Nimburg empty.
"If the only issue is how to make a third round, we can deal with it."
"The football needs the trust that he can get, only by choosing the end of his leader," says Pelta, who remains an optimist two days before the key day of his career.
Rachel promises that under his leadership, FACHR will start working actively
If the meeting on Thursday of Yindraži Reichl, acting Vice-President, would be chaired by the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association would be discontented.
Rachel promises that if they choose him, there will be a time of hard work.
He wanted to establish changes in the system and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for certain areas of football.
He also promised to address the problem of the rich; improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; attract more money into football; and continue the work of former President Ivan Gashek.
"As President, I would like to focus on football in general."
“From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to national collecting, professional football and youth football activities”.
"That's why I don't want to say that I'm going to do everything myself," said Rachel in her interview to the ČTK.
"I am a command player, and I want to allocate powers to the executive committee so that each member focuses on a particular area."
"I carefully distribute the tasks so that in each of these segments football will take great steps forward."
"It probably won't like many people because it will mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others," he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement allegedly caused him to doubt his candidacy.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if it makes sense; and that I will not be surrounded by people who put sticks into my wheels and question my every step," he explained his doubts.
"Nonetheless, many people told me I shouldn't give up, otherwise others will come."
"It's trust that I can't throw away," he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gashek.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to go through all this."
"There have been processes that could produce results in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, would be chosen, the situation in the Association could return to what was before the Gasheka.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and this is what Mirek Pelta is hardly competent to do."
"He's surrounded by people who play soccer so he can only be accessible to the chosen."
"I can be accused in a lot, but it's not subjective anymore."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football available to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just the elected minority," said Rachel.
Moreover, he denies that he will only be the President of the Czech Republic.
"Although many people are trying to claim back, I'm planning to do the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about the division of the second league into the Czech and Maritime parts, whose winners would continue to fight in the first league."
"This will prevent the current situation when there are only three Marine teams in the League, which is a problem for young Moravia players," said Reichle.
While the ruling club Plzeň Tomas Pazlik entered the presidential struggle, Rachel did not dare to assess his chances of victory.
"Nonetheless, I still feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as my vice-president, and I see that I have achieved some obvious success," said Reichle.
On the other hand, he is partly responsible for the lack of unity in the association.
Assuming that Pelta was "out of the process of returning credit to Czech football", he considered another rival, Pazlica, a strong candidate who had what to offer.
"No one can doubt that he worked well in Plzen this year."
"If he is chosen, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gaschek started, without any significant staffing changes in the committees."
"He wouldn't have broken the facts for his own benefit," said Rachel about his rival.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Drain in the water
Julia Stanek
Children's pools with universal fiber optics and status pools in Budapest. Travelers can try on Europe's incredible water - and relax the body in jacuzzi after a walk through the city or a walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meder could not afford to spend the last half of her research visits: without her shopping suit.
She was lying on her back in the water, looking up at the well-designed dome, swimming at the marble cherubs waiting for her at the end of the pool and falling in love with the carefully restored floating pools in the style of the ar-new.
She hesitated to add each popular swimming pool to her notebook - with important details about the construction and history of the building.
The history of Meder's architecture has seen more than 200 swimming pools - and has now gathered the impressions in its recently published book Badefreuden, where everything went from public swimming pools in Munich to historical baths in the Black Forest and functional concrete buildings in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited bathrooms in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is the present enthusiasm for buying culture.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but in the water everything else.
The only flaw is that the swimmers must be content with the blue coffee plate and the smell of chlorine, while the fugitives can breathe with the smooth smell of pine forests or listen to the joyful sound of birds in the park.
"I once asked myself why swimming pools should always be so horrible," says a resident in Vienna.
"So I started gathering beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
Swimming in the pool and finding oils in the sauna is a health factor in the bathrooms because Meder believes that all feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a pleasure for the eye if the builders take on such work. "Instead of the pool sex, you have the surface of water."
"The surface is very transparent, but also reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is visible: high ceilings, colorful tiles and tramplins.
The illustrative edition of the 190-page “The Joy of the Cup” contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of the Oasis of Health - and it is your desire to get into the water.
The water collector Meder found several outstanding specimens during the study in Hungary.
She found rich nitrates in the maple cave (Miškoltz-Tapolce) and thermal bath filled with sweet water in a bottle-shaped building (Vários Termālfürdö in Yasbren), as well as magnificent therapeutic baths, such as 100-year-old Secene baths in Budapest.
From many heated open pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, there is a stunning type. You can see all Zurich from the bathroom on the roof or look at the snowy Arlberg from the open pool in St. Anthony, and there is a steam window that lets you see what's happening on the sofa.
Maybe the most unusual design is waiting for bathers in Langenfeld.
In winter, a pair of three open cancers appear to be quite small in the background of the Ectal Mountains.
Algambra in Schwarzwald
Not every pool in the pool met the smell of chlorine.
Many thermal baths smell the series. The bath names of Arpad in Bekeshchab will smell oil so much that you may find it difficult to believe that you are in a healthy source.
The smell is caused by hydrocarbons in the stomach water. Water is almost black from the water that adheres to the skin as soon as you sink into the pool - a healthy experience of a certain type.
At some point, however, Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing places, and when she tried to visit an open pool of Czech baths in Lugačović, she found that the territory was sealed.
The bathrooms designed by architect Dushan Jurkovich in 1902 were closed.
When Meder looked into the exposed windows of a red-and-yellow-yellow-style building, she saw an ashtray growing between the coffee plates.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped by hot spots is the amazing swimming pool in Schwarzwald, the Palace of thermal water in Bad Wildbad.
The pools have been through three stages of construction. You will find not only the neo-Roman elements of the period after the construction in 1844, but also the Mauritian Algambra-style hall, which was added about 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Thermal Palace, a favorite swimming pool known as the Iris Meder, was not just because it was born from Schwarzwald.
"This achievement is so masterfully combining such different architectural styles," says Meder.
To dive into a thermal pool in such a yard is a second-degree occupation.
Speculation of agricultural products
The Dutch Bank is investigating trade in agricultural products.
Christian Titus
Will the Dutch Bank stop selling agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Akkermann had given the task of investigating the effects of speculation on the poor worldwide.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg-
According to one study, 84 per cent of Germans consider it unacceptable that banks would speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and maize.
Two thirds of the respondents demand that the Dutch Bank and other banks stop trade in agricultural products, as trade exacerbates the problems facing the poorest people around the world.
The findings were made in a study carried out by the Institute of Social Research and Statistical Analysis of Forsa by the Foodwatch user organization.
The study was based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Garald Shuman, demonstrates that the world's stock exchange rate is rising prices - and the banks are thus involved in global hunger.
The consumer protection campaign is directed directly against the head of Dutch Bank Joseph Ackermann, although large banking houses such as Godman Sacks and Morgan Stanley are trading in the same way.
The prices of the goods were originally thought to be a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any case, most experts now agree that the players have rejected the rules of supply and demand - and are being exploited by the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Akkermann responded to the criticism, promising to investigate the allegations and stated that no trade “is worth risking the good reputation of the Dutch Bank”.
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year when the results will be submitted to the Board of Directors of Doha Bank, with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce changes following the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods may decline or cease altogether.
Akkermann's working on his image.
President Tilo Bode welcomed the news, stressing his critical attitude towards the financial sector. "The growing food prices are an example of how foolish banks are currently acting against common interests."
As the bank's chief lobbyist Akkermann has a certain duty, Bode believes.
"Dad Bank must remove all investments that make money at food prices from the portfolio," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if it's the hungry people or the Doyche Bank's reputation."
Akkermann ' s immediate response was surprising at first, but in the meantime, the director would like to have an unmistakable image just a few months before his office was completed.
Dutch Bank announced Monday that the president would not go to the observatory as planned.
The cancellation of the dispute of speculation on the food market could improve its image.
He also had virtually no need to care for the costs - with the consequences of his successor ' s case.
Each second would have refused to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization ' s campaign.
Bode published the study on Tuesday, which was conducted for the Institute of Social Research and Statistical Analysis for Forsa 7 and 8 November, and 1001 attended.
Not more than eleven per cent believe that investments making the food price rate are acceptable to the Dutch Bank.
Many bank clients would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank was involved in such a trade.
43 per cent would recommend getting out of the bank, 49 per cent said they were thinking about closing the account and moving to another bank.
21st-century house in Vienna
Pavilion in a New Place
Ingeborg Vinsovski
Architectural history, with flights, falls and happy endings. Austria's Pavilion for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, was deserted and abandoned.
Now it's being reopened as an exhibition center.
The Pavilion of Austria, designed by Karl Schwantzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a well-known example of modern post-war architecture with its simple forms of glassy halls that expressed faith in technical progress.
Pavilion Schwancer won Gran-pri on architecture in 1958 for its lightweight silver construction from steel and glass.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built the pavilion of Austria at the next World Exhibition.
Finally, he celebrated the world in 1973 with his legendary four-cylinder BMW tower and her sister, a glass-shaped building.
Pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was transferred to the Swiss Garden around the South Wagon of Vienna, transformed and opened as the 20th century Museum in 1962 - and is often referred to as the "House of the 20th Century" for this reason.
However, the building did not approach the museum for technical and spatial reasons - there were no walls on which art could be hung and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna received a new home.
The house has been desolate since 2001, and its condition has become worse and worse.
Architator Adolf Krishanitz has so far re-established the pavilion, which was called the 21st century House, and will be used as a museum of contemporary art.
This museum is the Belveder Museum, which will open its first exhibition on Tuesday evening, in all respects a joyful event.
Agnes Husslin-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belveder Gallery in 2007, contributed to a new start.
Hussleyn-Arco, a graduate of the Faculty of the History of Fine Arts in Youth, who worked at Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and eventually became founder and director of the Museum of Modernity in Salzburg, convinced politicians and conservators to continue reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations and decided how the building would be used.
The new museum had to include a permanent exhibition of Fritz Votruba, coffee and bookstore along with contemporary art, and an office building had to be built.
Strict control of the budget
Krishnaitz was then an ideal candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, because of the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Session of Joseph Olbrih and won the competition, but he also studied at Schwanzer at the University of Technology, and the pavilion was for him “an extremely important place” where he attended the “almost every week” exhibitions.
He knew the original design and the tasks that stood before the building, the building that had already lost some of its greatness and ease when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems that have arisen during the last restructuring were much more serious: the building was “the absorber of energy”, says Krishanitz.
The window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, a reinforced glass safety glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced with a high-resistant safety glass.
The heat bridge's steel translations were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the roof.
Two lower floors have created space for the new use of the building, the fallen light source between the building and the street provides lighting - a virtually new building, but still the Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original outer doors were kept, and the building was decorated in an old red and brown color of protection from corrosion.
Hall cinema is the same as it was before.
All of this is under strict control of the museum administration and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, cheap and approved by museum management," says Krisjanitz, pointing to an uneven style in the basement.
The building remained flexible and easy, despite constraints, problems and conversions.
Krishnaitz recently noticed that the Brussels pavilion was a rough, typical "drop in the city".
Such architecture is “not always in its place” and yet wants to “stimulate this awareness”.
The house of the 21st century is located in a very right place, as the city's planning has brought unexpected success. A fully-constructed headquarters with offices and real estate is growing around Switzerland now.
The house of the 21st century can be complemented by the second building of Krishnaitz, the collector of the French von Gabsburg acquired the Berlin Temporary Exhibition Hall and is reported to have been negotiating with the city on its location in the Swiss garden.
Deutsche Bahn plans a multimillion-dollar anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn announced an anti-crisis plan to avoid the cancellation of the winter trains.
The number of staff should increase twice.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year to avoid winter breaks and train delays.
With reference to the Deutsche Bahn's internal anti-crisis plan, Bild reported that by 2015 investments had been planned to total around EUR 300 million.
Investments are designed to improve the efficiency of locomotives and the railway network even under extreme weather conditions.
The number of self-employed and staff employed in the snow-cleaning of roads and platforms will be increased by 2 to 16,000.
The aim is to clear snow and ice platforms before work and 90 per cent of the required shots within four to five hours.
Rudiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of the cancellation and delays of this winter's trains at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced considerable difficulties in passenger transport, since it did not catch up with the weather when the conditions worsened.
Many new regional trains of the years were expected to be approved by the Federal Railway Service.
There were also some delays in the provision of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check the ICE trains much more over the years after one of the ICE trains broke down at the main train station in Kelne.
Daughter Bank will pay millions of pounds of fines in the United States
New troubles have followed the riots around Joseph Akkermann, Director-General Doyche Bank: Doyche Bank is threatening a fine in the United States in many millions of pounds of sterling.
The Dutch Bank had little problems at home, the US industrial giant now pushed him. The Dutch Bank with headquarters in Frankfurt will pay $145 million (106 million) to settle the disputes that arose after bankruptcy during the five largest credit unions during the financial crisis.
A problem arose about the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Unions Management (NCUA), a financial market regulator, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The value of bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and the credit unions fell below.
"We are pleased that we have solved this problem without referring the parties to the court," said the representative of the Dutch Bank in New York.
In the agreement, the bank did not accept its responsibility.
The same is true for Citigroup, who agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Mattz welcomed the operational response of both banks.
The National Credit Union Management (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. credit unions and is involved in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer contributions.
NCUA is fighting for the compensation of losses that come from billions.
This is the first such agreement.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and launched a case against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in summer.
Suspect mortgage bonds are so-called securities secured by a pool of mortgages.
They're backed up by domestic loans.
This led to the fate of a number of financial companies, when in 2007 there was a bubble in the real estate market in the United States.
The U.S. Investment Bank Lehman Brothers ordered long-term living in September 2008 for a severe financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still fighting the storm.
Investors and regulators have raised a large number of claims, requiring compensation or punishment for fraud.
The Federal Housing Funding Agency (FHFA) is behind the biggest complaints.
It accuses 18 major international banks that they have acquired US credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of approximately $200 billion.
The Dutch Bank is also facing the threat of prosecution by FHFA for multiple agreements of a total value of $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires the Frankfurt headquarters bank to assume responsibility for “substantial losses” but has not yet indicated the exact amount.
The Dutch Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and reported its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffet invests 10 billion in IBM
Buffet's financial gurney is actively investing in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares of more than $10 billion.
So far, the largest American investor Warren Buffet has always stated that he does not invest in computers and IT companies because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, the IBM annual report changed its view on investments in the sector.
According to Buffet, he had to understand much earlier that IBM was primarily offering services and purchasing computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffet's investments were valued as a knight's move.
IBM, an IT vet, has now received the title "Sir IBM."
In an interview with the U.S. business channel CNBC Buffet, he reported that he had acquired IBM shares for a total of $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest shareholders of IBM shares at 5.5 per cent.
Buffet said that even IBM knew nothing about his participation until recently.
He commended the management that had been able to make even during the financial crisis.
"They did a lot of work," said Buffet, referring to the management strategy.
A significant time has been focused on high-income IT services such as data centres.
The founder of the computer industry, now over 100 years old, offers software and advisory services, as well as powerful business computers.
So far, Buffet has avoided technological companies.
He claimed that he only invests in companies that he understands.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, in the production of lubricants and in machinery.
His holding of Berkshire Hathaway holds shares in a long list of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Municher Rück), along with about 80 of its own subsidiaries.
At 81 years of age, Berkshire Hathaway acquired a small textile company in the 1960s and built on it one of the most expensive companies in the world.
And yet he remained modest.
Made it a cultural figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable instinct of making money brought him the nickname Oracle of Omaha.
The share price of IBM increased by one per cent before opening markets after Buffet's investment announcement.
The Blue Giant, as IBM is still called, is on the stock exchange of more than $220 billion, making it one of the most expensive high-tech companies in the world along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffet, however, said he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Her founder Bill Gates is his close friend.
Imminent danger
After the discovery of the "Cwikau hunts", Turkish media began to question the power of the law in Germany.
One of the newspapers speaks of “blood ideology”, which is now rising again to the surface.
The killings of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of an extremist ideology.
Fear and concern have become a response to this communication in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community of Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has caused the long forgotten fears of life. Such right-wing extremist attacks on Turks have not since been on fire in Melne in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
There has never been any doubt, however, that Xenophobia exists in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network currently found has a scope that is not yet fully aware of.
"Rebirth of Blood Ideology?" was the headline of the internet version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper notes, on the other hand, that one of the criminals was a secret intelligence expert, and expresses concern that the German authorities might be involved in the law-extremist scourge.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted peacefully by replacing the victims of racial hatred with a silent picket against the Brandenburg Gates in these exits.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin at a ceremony with German and Turkish politicians celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral employment agreement.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story.
In some Turkish media, education was like a bribe. "A gift from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of one of the articles on the Turkish internet portal Haber X, commenting on the murder series.
The German edition of Hürriyet also did not miss this parallel.
"It smells bad" is the name of the column of Ahmet Kulakhji.
He noted that people who paid taxes and their work had contributed significantly to the transformation of Germany.
The conduct of the police and the subsequent success of the area were severely criticized on the German-Turkish Internet Forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not thought of monitoring suspects in the law-extremist circles before.
Some authors have come up with a rather harsh rhetoric: "If they continue to act the same way, migrants will have no choice except armed self-defence."
"This will be the best self-defense."
"Peace in Germany is very much dependent on how the entire network and the legality of punishment will be discovered," says Selen.
The crimes in Milan and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of the threat of peace in Germany.
The photograph of burned ruins in Zolingen was deeply engraved in the memory of Germans and Turks.
No other event has shown the Turks so clearly living here that they are at risk, and the Germans, that mistrust and equality can result in real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of unity among Turks.
Do Not Repeat the Previous Error
The Turkish press at that time largely condemned the failure of the German police after the attacks, and Helmut Cole refused to visit the survivors in Melne.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the fires in Zolingen, but his participation in the memorial ceremony in Kelne was accepted by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel, in his speech, calculated the taxes paid by the Turks in Germany,
It is as if he had determined the value of man by the taxes that he pays.
The current media coverage in Turkey has again shown how the mistrust of many German Turks in the current German State has been deepened ever since.
It was clear that efforts should now be made to identify and re-evaluate right-wing terrorist organizations in Germany.
Bank scandal in Lake Zurich
Most European banks are not in France or Italy but in Switzerland.
UBS has not been aggravated during the financial crisis and has since been constantly fighting against one another and against the other.
Now he must be returned to the right course by the German.
Alex Weber probably didn't suspect that he would play that role.
In July, after his effective retirement from the position of the head of the Federal Bank, he was announced that he would begin his work in 2013 as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank; unexpected and profitable career.
Alex Weber was clearly in shock, praised Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its renewed strength, and made several friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS has been able to change for the better."
"I look forward to working with Caspar Filliger and Oswald Grubel."
But in September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
The UBS trader in London went through bank security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
The Executive Director of UBS Oswald Grubel, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has been considered ill, and everyone wants to know: when will Alex Weber finally get to his post?
Weber has to consult the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, he will take office as President of the Council in May, not in 2013.
It's not gonna be easy for Alex Weber.
He is a professor of economics and a specialist in the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he will undoubtedly need time to adapt.
He was suddenly responsible for the bank's strategy, which proved that he had long earned the title "the biggest bank scandal in Europe".
UBS, on the one hand, is very large - until recently he has managed the largest assets in the world - and with the other, he does not come out of the scandals.
The proud Swiss bank seems to be saving nothing.
It all started during the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had a great reputation.
The Bank has united the image of a hidden and sustainable but at the same time a greedy asset manager with ambitious goals and a desire to become the largest player in the investment bank.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion, thus managing more cash customers than any other bank in the world,
and entered the league of the largest banks of the world as an investment bank.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, former banker and professor of banking, who has long taught at the University of Zurich's Institute of Banking, explains: "I have always led my UBS students as a model of a good bank."
"I know what we know now, you can ask how I could have made a mistake."
He was really wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that there was something wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, Executive Director Peter Wuffley, who was considered to be an outstanding intellectual and to the same extent a brilliant banker, suddenly left his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The Bank ' s investment unit tried to play on substandard securities and had to write billions.
You want to believe it, you don't, but UBS reported an increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to withstand the crisis.
The Bank was indeed able to find investors - but investors from whom many banks would have recently declined - a very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign fund that was so hidden that even its name was not reported.
It was just the first blow.
In April 2008, things got a lot worse.
The Bank had to declare new billions of losses, and the president of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, the second in-service president of the Board of Directors in Switzerland, resigned in 2006.
A disaster occurred in October 2008 because of the lack of investment during the UBS financial crisis, and the State had to save it.
The National Bank has purchased UBS toxic precious paper for an unnamed number of billions, and the Swiss Confederation has paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with a binding conversion to become the bank's successor.
The whole of Switzerland was in shock: the country was aware of the dramatic consequences of the massive banks in the small country.
Finally, the UBS final balance in 2007 was five times more than all of Switzerland ' s production (see chart).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," says bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred shortly after the first.
Several months later, UBS capitalized in a tax dispute with the United States and stated that it was willing to transfer data from state clients who may have been taxed by the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million in the amount of unwarranted business income plus fine.
UBS thus recognized more or less that it was a tool for tax evasion.
At the same time, UBS lost the advantage of always fighting for rich customers, the secret curtain.
After that, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same as it was before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
The customer's money out of the way.
In a few months, the bank lost confidence in both main areas of its activity, in investing in failed speculation and in asset management as a result of aid and tax evasion.
And everything just calmed down and it turned out that UBS was able to break down the situation as this disaster happened with a trader, and the only trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
It is clear that risk management in the investment office is not yet working.
“Adobolly’s incident made it clear that risk control was insufficient,” says Martin Jansen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of Germany's largest banks is also convinced: "The UBS problem is that he has no risk control tool."
It was the caution of Swiss bankers to keep the world ' s largest assets at large — not too high a risk, but security for money, whether or not the world was broken off outside the Alpine Republic.
The safes of Swiss banks have become a symbol of unbreakable reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolise a refined taste of chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich is still in the form of a worthy private Swiss bank, just a little more.
Her mood is just a classic.
The main bank office is located in Zurich on Bankhofstrasse, which leads from the main train station directly to Lake Zurich, in the area of the snow hats of Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious and the rental rates for shops are one of the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss shops of the type Confiserie Sprüngli here you can find such jubilee companies as Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the Court of Creda Suisse and the elite private banks, such as Julius Bear.
The heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
Along the walls covered with marble, there's a lot of leathery surprises, and a row with the bank's emblem is a big safe.
UBS knows what his clients need, security.
But both the largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point they gave up Swiss ideas about the bank case - or, as one of the small Swiss banks believes, they betrayed them.
He would not like to see his name in the newspaper - like all Swiss bankers, he also cooperates with two of the largest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too large - in particular, in the investment bank, where England is very active.
In his opinion, the Swiss have nothing to add here.
"And if there's anything, it means they've adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs a long time ago."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS and brought it the first major gains - and then the fiasco. No other European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became evident on 15 October 2008.
"In that environment, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the country's history," writes Lucas Hessig in his book Krah UBS.
Policymakers approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If the Swiss banks ask, they will say that the problem is mainly UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks joined a large group in June 1998.
A bank was established, which was already too large for small Switzerland at the time of the merger, and a bank that continued to grow.
This has also helped two banks that have trained UBS to complement each other. One has been a rich but well-developed bank specialized in asset management in Zurich; the other has not been so rich but much more internationalized.
International investment banks suddenly got access to a large amount of money that they could use to turn the all-powerful wheel.
Two names relate to UBS growth: Peter Wolfley, Executive Director of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wolfley and Ospel were a team of dreamers," says bank analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wulfley, an intellectual, modest and deeply understanding model and statistics, and Ospel with his inner instinct, walking all the way up, starting with an intern in the bank."
But Ospell ended up on Wolfley.
And Wolfley could have made a critical mistake. "He decided his models were real," said Geiger.
"That's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
UBS officials remember well the meetings of the members of the government, where Wolfley always repeated the same slogan, to subjugate Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At that time, he headed the tournament table, where the success of the banks was achieved.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to make some of this journey.
UBS was the largest player in the trade of currency and public securities.
The senior management consultants, however, indicated a weak position, and according to the terminology, which is called "permanent income", UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had failed in American mortgage products.
To shut the door, UBS joined an adventure that hardly cost him his life.
In pursuit of growth, the bank itself and its hedge fund invested in US substandard securities.
This was developed in a large mechanism that combined valuable securities based on American mortgages and sold them further - continuing to bear risks.
Even when other banks had long been looking for a way out of this process, UBS had not stopped.
“UBS bought until summer 2007, when the American real estate market was already on fire,” says Bank Analyst Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager had to go after the other as attempts to bring the bank in order were more difficult than it seemed at first.
Posts in UBS have become a children's game with chairs and to this day remain hopeless.
Anyone who will lead this huge bank is almost impossible.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
Geiger's banking analyst already has the idea of giving up investment banking, focusing on asset management and forgetting his Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not ready to go that far.
However, it is clear that investment activities need to be substantially exploited.
The new head of Sergio Hermotti's bank plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Swiss banker was actually considered only as a temporary solution when the bank suddenly broke up with his predecessor Grubel.
In the past, he was able to show the character and now, as the Turkish bank said on Tuesday, he is headed by UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotti plans to return the investment bank to the state in which he was in the mid-1990s.
It reduces 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a development concept.
What's UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These questions are likely to be asked by Axel Weber.

The fears of recession in Europe are drawn down to the US Stock Exchange
The rising recession in Europe has worsened the mood of American investors at the beginning of the week.
The change of governments in Athens and Rome had little effect.
The fall in industrial production on the continent has faded the hope that a debt crisis can be overcome in the womb.
The overall relief followed by changes in Governments in Rome and Athens has not been supported.
The euro has dropped against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek jars were still considered half full, not half empty, but now the problems are back to the top, said Mark Luskini of Janney Mongomery Scott.
The financial stock exchanges were included in the sales lists.
The Dow Jones industrial index was closed at 12.078 with a fall of 0.6 per cent.
The market barometer in the course of trade fluctuates between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The larger S&P 500 index was closed at 1251 points, falling by one per cent.
The Nasdaq technology index lost 0.8 per cent, trading at 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax fell by 1.2 per cent, closing at 5985 points.
The euro area industry in 17 countries has significantly reduced its production and adapted to the end of growth.
The Eurostat Statistical Service reported that in September companies produced two per cent less than in the previous month.
"We are not on the island, we depend on them," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also stated that Europe would hardly quickly shrink its recession and that banks were demonstrating further signs of weakness.
The legendary investor Warren Buffet was only able to confirm these fears, and in an interview with CNBC, he said that it was still unclear whether Europe was strong enough to do whatever it took to end the crisis.
He therefore believed that it was too early to invest in European public bonds or in banks.
Instead, Buffet threw a ten-year-old principle into a garbage basket and invested in the American high-tech industry.
Its investment in the IBM amounted to more than $10 billion during the sale of the stock price of this older company by almost one per cent against the trend.
The shares were closed, almost unchanged, at $187.35.
Buffet stated that he had paid an average of $170 for the share and now has a share of 5.5 per cent.
The stock price of his investment company Berkshire Hathway fell by 1.3 per cent.
Bank of America's shares dropped by 2.6 per cent, much stronger than the market.
The Bank has converted almost all remaining parts of the China Building Bank into cash, with $6.6 billion.
The Bank is mainly planning to support its share of net sales profits in order to comply with more stringent rules.
The aircraft manufacturer Boing won, reducing the losses on Dow-Jones.
The price of shares rose by 1.5 per cent after the corporation received the largest order in its history.
On Sunday, Emirates ordered 50 long-range aircraft 777 of a total cost of $18 billion.
Including the option to buy another 20 aircraft, the total actually is $26 billion.
Approximately 710 million shares were transferred to the New York Stock Exchange.
The shares of 719 companies grew, 2281 dropped and 79 remained at the same level.
The shares of 630 companies were raised, 1913 fell, and 82 remained at the same level in Nasdaq with 1.38 billion shares.
Imagined ravens fill the city
The players are considered troublebirds in many places. Today, experts say these very smart birds will no longer be able to get out of the city.
Some prefer birds, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible.
The problem of birds, however, has not yet been addressed.
At the first symposium on crows, experts in the city of Lear in East Frisian argued that the player could no longer be expelled from the city.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Conservatives argued that the root of urban problems was the migration of specially protected toys, indicating that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly disrupting traditional habitats.
The growing construction and cutting of traditional trees made life more difficult for birds.
The crows are under protection.
In the city of Zest in Westphalia and in the north-west in the north, Dipholce, Ahime under Bremen and Lere there are large colonies of more than 600 parents.
The divergent project of shooting crows in Lere caused unauthorized newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described the catch of birds in hunting and the killing of them with sticks as special cruelty.
"The ordinary movement and spooking don't give a shit."
The collapse of water currents or tree rubbing has often had adverse consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lara, Baden-Wurttemberg.
"Animal spreads and large colonies spread and spread to other areas."
Disappointment may be possible only in the form of an exception to hospitals, old-age homes and schools.
"We're going to have to live with them, and getting rid of them is not an option."
The problem in cities will not be solved apart from the surrounding areas, says Mayor Wolfgang Keller.
The combination of bird-freaking from sheltered areas and encouraging them to return to other areas could be an exit.
"Information stands instead of benzopile" was a slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnologist Uto Maria Jurgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We must be convinced of ourselves to live with this problem."
Jürgens was one of the founders of the educational career in Asherberg in Schleswig-Golstein, where information stands on the lives of highly intelligent players.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jürgens also expressed his opinion on bird noise complaints. "The noise is transmitting a lot of information, and they have to tell each other a lot."
The mind and the muzzle of these birds have entered the legends, and players often use not only the weapon to control the eyepiece, but also the weapon themselves.
Researchers at Cambridge University recently protested the measure of bird mind on four players.
In one experiment, birds quickly realized that they had to jump on the raindrops to get a mollusk.
Without special training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to cut the rain.
In another experiment, similar players had to face a more difficult challenge.
The researchers put a small windshield with a pencil in a vertical cylinder.
Birds couldn't get a curse.
But the researchers gave them pieces of lead.
All four birds were used as a propellant to make hairs and use hairs to tie the windshield by the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four players have been able to do this since the first attempt.
Ronald concludes Portugal at Euro-2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for victory in the last minute have not been maintained.
Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland took the last seats at the 2012 Euro Championship in Poland and Ukraine.
Under the command of the superstar Kristian Ronald, who killed for 8 and 53 minutes, Portugal defeated Bosnia and Herzegovina with an account of 6:2 (2:1), ideally formed its fifth exit to Euro after 0:0 in the first phase.
Cheham had enough 1:0 (0:0) in the second round to play off against the Montenegrin Outsider after a clear victory in the first round (2:0).
Croatia did not miss its chance, played 0:0 against Turkey, and Ireland easily scored 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th minute), Nelder Postiga (72nd and 82nd) and Miguel Velozu (80th) killed the remaining goals for Portugal.
The former Bundesligi professionalist from Wolfsburg Zvezdan Misimovich and Captain Emir Spahic reduced the difference between two points due to the resultant penalty for the 41st minute and the 65th minute in Bosnia.
Sena Lulic received a second yellow card for the 54th minute.
Portugal had already kicked Bosnia out of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
Portugal launched an excellent start at Lisbon's Estadio da Lus.
Ronaldo took an early start, a free blow to the door about 30 meters.
The good four hours later, Nani demonstrated her long-lasting abilities, with a 25-metre score up to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not open the account at the first half of the day, got their first chance thanks to the attacking Edina Jacko.
The former Wolfsburg player from the leading English champion Manchester City for the 33th minute sent a ball of head to the lower end of the barn, but the ball did not cross the line of the door.
Iráček is killing for the Czech Republic
Then the focus was on Judge Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding.
Following the attack on Elder Postig in the Bosnian criminal scene at the 36th minute, Stark decided that the Portuguese game simulated and showed him a yellow card.
Stark also sentenced the questionable penalty for playing by hand after Fabiu Quantran-Misimovich had carried it out.
After the break of the European Vice-Chiefs in 2004, the account was secured by another four goals.
Peter Jairachek has revealed all the remaining doubts about checks at the 81st minute.
The 1976 European Championships are sent to the European Championship for the fifth time in order.
The success was also echoed by coach Michael Bilek and legions of the Bundesliga Michael Kadletz (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) after a mistake at the very beginning that could have been disastrous.
Petr Chech's turn at 9 a.m., thanks to his flashlight, prevented the potential autogol of Tomas Sivok.
The best chance in Montenegro was when the duet of Steven Jovetic and Dean Damianović were on the field.
Damianovic was hit by a 40-minute strike at the end of the criminal scene and he barely killed the goal of the Czech Republic.
After the break of the stand, she saved the already-scattered Cheha World Cup after FC Seoul left the field for the 50th minute.
The winner was killed just before the final whistle.
At the time, Turkey did not enjoy football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after winning 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks couldn't play better than destroying 0:0 in Zagreb.
Although there is virtually no doubt now that the coach of the Gus Hiddink Congregation will now release the team on the platform that reached the third place in 2002, the Croats will be held for the fourth time in the final round of the European Championship.
The Turks were almost ideally able to launch 31,000 spectators at the Maximir Stadium.
The long hit by Seljuk Ian at the seventh minute came to a standstill, and the attacker Kazim was unable to pull the ball off the net.
Croatia then woke up and took more control of the game.
After the break, the Croats continued the game in excellent form.
The Legionaries of the Bundesligi Daniel Pranic (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Aintracht, Frankfurt) were on the field with Mario Manzukitch of the Wolfsburg team, who took over Ivan Perisich from Dortmund for the 62nd minute.
Trapattoni goes to Euro-2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first Euro entry after 1988.
Coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already looked confident in his place after winning 4:0 in the first phase, captured leadership for 32 minutes thanks to Stephen Ward's naked.
Konstantin Vasiliev from the guest team compared the account for the 57th minute.
Ireland took a good turn from the beginning, but only at the 23rd minute Robbie Kin from Los Angeles made the first clean head shot.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender could not have allowed him to bring Ireland forward.
The target was killed for 32 minutes.
As Paul Londonka’s galloper was protected, Ward proved to be in the right place and changed the score to 1:0 by playing the ball through the line.

SAP plans to double the number of employees in China
The largest software manufacturer in Europe, SAP, plans to invest billions and almost double its number of employees in China over the next few years.
The company in Dax's listing announced on Thursday that it was going to invest about two billion dollars by 2015 (about 1.5 billion euros).
"We will create more opportunities for research and development and employ thousands of people," Bill McDermott, one of the executive directors of the SAP, said in his statement at a consumer exhibition in Beijing.
The 2500-person state must grow to 4,500.
The leader of the world market for industrial software plans to double the number of offices from five to ten or eleven.
SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chendu and Daljan.

"Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth on the basis of information in China."
Mass killings - human dimension
A tense and very good new book by Peter Englund, "The Beauty and the Grief: Personal History of the First World War", begins with a long list of active people from whom the heart dies.
Here’s the advice to read on: Cut this page carefully and use it as a bookmark.
You'll get to know these people very close as Mr. England warns, and this list of active persons will be your GPS, your monkey at times when, like one of these men and women, you'll get out of the way and lose yourself in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book he wrote now is unusual, he describes it, quite precisely, as an anti-historic work.
It has few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, hunting journalists or discussions of tactics and war technology.
It's not so much a book about what it was, he explains how much "book about what it looked like" it's about "stimulations, impressions, anxiety and state of mind."
The book "Krasota and Grief" shared the experiences of 20 years of war, more or less unremarkable men and women, from both sides of the front line, from schoolmen and botanists to alpineists, doctors, ambulances and staff.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone falls into captivity, loses his hand or his foot, comes out of mind or dies.
Their lives here are like church candles: new ones are added to many others, and some are then turned off.
Mr. England's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
This is also an amendment to the idea that the First World War was only a serious war on the West Front.
"Grace and grief" is a gift from the panorama of other theatres of military action: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are covered with bee oil; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under pyramids; the unresolved problem is the flies of the sea.
It's a fascinating book, almost from the very beginning.
War covers the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, who smells like smokeless dust.
When you're a woman and you're at home with your children, will you stay in the area or flee?
Anyway, who's doing this?
Almost no one understands what's going on and why we have to fight this war at all.
"Inadequate facts," notes Mr. Englund, "are filled with suspicions, assumptions, hopes, fears, compelling ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and hearings."
"Grace and grief" follows the fate of such people as Florence Farmboro, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German Open Sea Fleet sailor.
Their stories were taken mainly from memoirs, letters, and other material that had already been published.
The stories of their lives may be frightening or fascinating, but they are most alive thanks to the small moments and the explosive details gathered by Mr. Enlund.
Many of them are about deprivations and how to deal with them.
Telling the history of the German schoolgirl, he says, "Erzace, everywhere."
"Coffee substitute, sub-aluminium, non-absorbed resin, paper binders, wood puddles."
He continues to talk about hertz-piste in Germany.
It describes "the meat of pressed rice ground in a barrel of fat (and decorated with false bone made from wood); tobacco made from dried roots and dried potatoes; shoes covered with wood".
He noted that there were “837 registered meat substitutes allowed to produce sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes”.
Some stories tell us about honor and courage.
One American notes his own passion for cruelty and says of war: "You feel that, at the end of the day, this is what men were created for, rather than sitting in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or bestsellers, and claiming that this show and there is civilization and under your fancy shirt, there is no hidden barbarous."
The British soldier, on the other hand, notes that he will most likely die and that no one will notice or be disappointed.
"When a person calms down with the thought of self-sacrifice, he would like to think that this will happen before the public," he writes.
But that's the opposite. It's a terrible thing. It's like a convicted man who's being held in secret.
Other comments relate to the old Europe, which is being demolished, and to new forms of fear.
"The conflict has become more and more economical," writes Mr. Englund, "the war plant."
He points out the coming of the one he calls "a new species in the bestier of the beginning of the century: a beautiful and ideologically convincing mass killer in a well-dressed costume that builds a cut, sitting behind a written table."
People act unpredictablely: low-level practices are the same as heroism.
Mr. Englund told me about the soldiers who were all trying to get rid of the venereal disease of prostitutes in order to avoid services on the front.
"The very grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonorrhea dust, which soldiers have bought and spread over their genitals in hopes of entering the hospital," he writes.
"All the despairing ones have thrown him into the eye, which has often led to lifelong blindness."
Translated by Swedish Peter Gravez, Mr. Enlund's prose is flexible but nebrosive, which is perfectly suited for his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, it shows how the war has “freed completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred”.
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The better books of the I World War were often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fassela or by such novels as "On the Western Front Without Change" by Erika-Maria Remark, not by exhausting historical works.
Mr. England's book is part of this templateless pantheon.
His book has the most amazing final that I can remember in undeserving literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it's like he got from the book to the page with a list of characters, pulled it out of your hands and burned it with a knife.
After the previous error, the résumé is carefully calculated
Hundreds of police officers, some in protective helmets, were involved in the operation.
Night hours from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because there must have been fewer people in Zukotti Park at the time.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers, and the others first said that they were going to study.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre of the event, and his presence stressed the importance of the Department of Police operations.
There could be no recurrence of episodes in the last few weeks, such as the use of cross-gas against protesters, which was contrary to departmental rules and caused a storm of sympathy for the public to the occupiers.
After two weeks of planning and training, a police operation was launched to get rid of the protesting Zukotti Park.
The authorities prepared to observe the development of occupations in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis studies were conducted on Randels Island, which was calculated on Zukotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called training courses in the event of riots - counter-terrorism measures that involve the rapid displacement of a large number of police officers - in the sense of the Low Manhattan.
The final training took place on Monday evenings on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came in "the last minute", he told the source of the orders in which the task was referred to as "training".
"Those few cops that I know and who have been called to this case didn't say they were sent to Zukotti Park," said the man who spoke in terms of anonymity.
"The only ones who knew they were going to Zukotti Park were in the department's highest positions."
One of the reasons for the secrecy was a lesson that had been taught by the city.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clear the park, but withdrew from hundreds of protestors who had slipped within the deadline and heard about these plans.
On Tuesday, police officers from various police units, including police forces from the districts, were involved in the operation, which were usually used to control the criminal districts.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like at work, come and leave the park during the day, which makes one hour of the night a suitable time for arrival.
"It was right to do this when the park was the least of the people," he said.
Rescue machines with projectors and loudspeakers assembled at Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge before moving forward.
The prospector and the pre-written announcements made by the thunderstormers seem to have frightened many protestors.
When officers of the administrative units entered the park in their blue breezes, many protestors simply picked up their belongings and left.
The police reported that the tents had not been reached until 1:45 p.m., allowing protesting time to gather things.
Other police groups, according to eyewitness evidence, gathered on the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a representative of the Department of Police, said it was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see how the police were doing, and that the police had treated them cruelly.
Mr. Brown said that television cameras on Church Street, along the western border of the park, could have taken a picture.
When the police came to the west through the chest of personal items protesting, including bags, plastic envelopes and polyethylene bags, full clothing, the Department of Sanitation followed, collecting what had been abandoned.
Some Protestants who refused to leave have been dragged outside, and the photos soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protesters took positions near the kitchen camp at the center of the park.
Some have built barricades, and the police have entered, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the camp’s epicenter were beaten up together.
And two men were hiding in the trees, Mr. Kelly said.
To cut the castles, rescue personnel were called on.
There were no arrests in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The cleaning operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police reported.
Mr. Brown said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of them were arrested for “infringement of public order and resistance to detention”, he said.
Joseph J. Esposito, Head of Department and Chief of Staff, was the highest-ranking officer in the department.
Phil. T. Pulaski, head of the department's police department, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, although he was present, "he didn't lead the operation," said Mr. Brown.
The second group of police were waiting along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Sidar Street, in case they had to enter.
The fences were placed on Cortland Street, in the district north of the park, and on Pine Street, in the district south.
Observers have seen police from these positions expand the perimeter even further beyond the Zukotti Park.
At one point, observers saw a group of policemen, many with shields, pushing people further.
About 28 people were in the north perimeter.
Some of the most serious events happened south of the park.
About 5 a.m. to the south of Pine Street, one of the protestors pushed on the roof of the police car, while the other, according to the public, fired air from the police van.
At some point from the crowd, he flew a piece of light.
As a result, one police officer and one protestant were hospitalized.
The union of school staff will be sent to the city court for dismissal
The trade union, representing hundreds of school staff who lost seats last month, plans to trial the city on Wednesday, claiming that dismissals were not necessary and were discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students are taught.
The trial is probably the last means available to the union of the District Council 37 seeking to cancel dismissal.
Sixty-two school assistants, the coordinator of work with parents and other employees, who were among the lowest-paid workers in the city, lost their seats on 7 October as a result of the union leaders calling their political response to their refusal to give the city access to health funds managed by working groups to close the gap in the budget last spring.
The city officials categorically rejected this accusation.
At the City Council hearings last month, the Chancellor of Schools Dennis M. Walcott said that dismissals were part of the budget they signed in June.
One member of the board had been paralysed and told him that there was nowhere in the budget any indication that school support staff would be fired.
The representatives of the 37 district council reported that they had made a statement of claims, warning the Department of Education that an action was being brought against it; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to announce the formal submission of an application to the Supreme Court of State in Manhattan.
Mr. Walcott and the Department of Urban Education will be listed as respondents and eight temporary dismissed workers as claimants, all of them black or Latin American women, as well as most assistants who have lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the legal department of the city, said that the city had not seen the claim and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to the preliminary version of the complaint at New York Times, the trade union focused on a number of dismissals in schools in the poor areas of the city to support the claim of unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools had lost more assistants because they were chronically under-funded.
He points out that while the Staten Island was not fired and there were few schools in the Upper East Side or Tribeki, 17 school support workers lost seats in the 23rd district in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in the 8th and 9th districts in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants working in free high school 36 in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students live in poverty, the claim says: “These are not areas of state-owned parents who can find money to fill budget gaps”.
P.S. The 36th budget was cut by 3.26 per cent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed how to calculate additional funding for every poor student entering school.
The trade union also claims that the school director could be misled by the language of the notification allowing the dismissal of the coordinators for working with parents.
The notice used the word “exceeding” although “exceeding” was more commonly used when the teacher from the school’s payment statement moved to the list of existing employees paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six coordinators for working with parents were fired," says the blacklist, "not just transferred."
Mission completed, Congress ready for the Libya Agreement
It seems that the Republicans and Democrats at the Capital Hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the rise in Libya.
All that's needed is to succeed in the dispute, the former dictator Muamar Kaddafi was arrested and killed, and the American intervention ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee should consider a resolution issued by President John Kerry (Democratic, Massachusetts) along with Senators John McKain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Liberman (independent, Connecticut), who praised the Libyans for their successful uprising and the American troops for their " worthiness".
"The meaning of this resolution is to pay tribute to the brave people of Libya when they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"This is a confirmation of their support for democratic aspirations by both parties."
The language may seem harmless, but no further discussion on Libya has been easy.
This summer, legislators from both parties argued with each other and the White House on the formulations of a series of resolutions approving or condemning the role of the American army in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June Kerry and McKain introduced a resolution allowing for the limited use of American armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority of both parties and did not vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill was broken in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support the proposal to cut off the financing of the American operation in Libya.
This left an American mission in some kind of legislative purgatory -- when Congress is angry enough to criticise Obama's approach to the mission, but not so bad as to actually blow the ground out of her feet.
Then the events took hold of the indecisiveness of the Congress
In August Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels, and Caddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission was officially completed on 31 October.
Now the Senate can be ready for action.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs “is admired by the people of Libya for its incredible courage and unconventional persistence in the pursuit of freedom” and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism”.
The resolution also “confirms the national interest of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya”.
Will new measures be fully supported by the Foreign Affairs Council or will legislators be developed as a June bill?
Senator Richard G. Luger, leader of the Republicans in the Committee, opposed the latest version.
The representative of Luger said Monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other hand, the Capital of the House of Representatives should vote this week for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a key legislative priority for almost every Republican and for some Democrats in Congress.
This measure proposed by a member of the House of Representatives of Bob Gudlat (Republican, Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or to something else to be put to the plenary vote of the Congress on this call.
Other legislators had not yet been able to make their amendments to the plenary meeting, but not because they had not tried.
The Gudlat amendment is only one of 68 constitutional amendments that address a wide range of issues raised in this call.
Some doubled - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate - and others were minor variations.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendments only in the House of Representatives and a few more on “Federal expenditure control”.
Some of them are also identical, but they give their authors -- mainly to newly elected Republicans who want to decorate their summaries -- the opportunity to boast that they have “suggested” such a proposal.
The Budget Control Act, which took place in August, required the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote in favour of the balance of the budget amendment.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to limit the number of members of the Congress and members of the House of Representatives of José Serrano (Democrat, New York) want to abolish the two-term limitation for the President.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson, Younger (Democrat, Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and health.
The amendment that prohibits single-sex marriages has been proposed for many years, as well as another banning the burning of the flag.
Some legislators would also like to authorize the repeal of federal laws if they objected to them by two thirds of the states.
No matter how members of Congress tried to propose amendments, they were moving no faster than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 such amendments and 66 of them were introduced at 110th.
This rate is seen from the early 1990s when Congress members, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But their success was not more than it is now.
The last amendment that was adopted - 27 - was approved in 1992, but it was actually introduced to Congress in 1789.
"The beat, but not won," said Giffords in his first television interview after the attempt
Ten months after an armed man shot at her at a public event in Tuson, a member of the House of Representatives Gabriel Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona) appeared on Monday evening at the federal channel, sang a melody from the Broadway Show "The Sun returns tomorrow" and said he wanted to heal more than to go back to Congress.
With 20/20 E-by-News with Diana Sawyer, Gifords worked hard to formulate proposals and needed help in walking.
The program showed her a difficult way to recover from the trauma caused by the pulse, which broke the skull and pierced the left side of the brain from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she unexpectedly returned to the House of Representatives and voted triumphantly on the draft debt law.
In his first television interview after the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13 people, Gifords smiled, laughed, and sang, and called his recovery “hard”.
As far as Sawyer's question is concerned, 41-year-old Giffords said, "Very good."
An interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hourly special edition of 20/20, which was shown before the release of the new book by Gabby: History of Courage and Hope.
The Special Mission reported on the restoration of the Giffords after the shooting on 8 January.
On a video taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she's lying on a hospital bed with a head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physicists teach her how to do simple things.
Squeeze your head.
Pull out your mouth.
And then her first word, "What."
A few days later, Giffords gave the second word, "toss," asking to change the breakfast menu.
The video shown by E-bi shows that music played a central role in the healing of the Giffords: we see a congressman singing with doctors "The Girls Just Want to Have Fun" Cindy Loper and "Free Fall" Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, she said she wouldn't remember the day of the trial.
Her husband told me that he read the Giffords article in the March 12 shooting newspaper when she stopped him for the first time to ask about the six who were killed at the time.
Suspected attacker Jard Lee Lafner is in Missouri prison and is being treated in court for forced treatment.
"Many people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Weighing, heavy, heavy."
Once when she was cured, Kelly Sawyer said, "I'm defeated."
"And I said, 'Ebby, you're not defeated,' said Kelly.
You're just beat.
And you're going through it, you're going to get better and you're going back stronger than ever.
Soldiers feel more sadness than respect
The event was a party at Wall Street, which raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock was playing a ballad about helplessness, disappointments and losses.
Several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots, and seamen were stationed around him.
The tuxedo applauded him standing.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Zaltzman, who organized the spring money collection.
Senior military officer at the concert, which was also then chaired by the Chiefs' Committee, Admiral Mike Mallen, saw the role of the army in another.
"They were treated like orphans," wrote the officer in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect.
Perfectly opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relationships that have developed between the army and often the egalitarian, sometimes admired by the American public.
The troops are praising their victims.
But praise is their price, the soldiers say.
The public is becoming more and more self - centered, as it were, in the form of pity for people.
"We are not the victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and soon went to Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way for some to show support is to address us as unlucky."
This is a sensitive topic for military leaders who do not want to look ungrateful or disagree with the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger experienced by the returning armies in recent years of the Vietnam War has been much worse.
As a result, most of the discussions on mourning take place quietly and only between war veterans.
After his two sons had returned from the battle in the foothills of the sea, Colonel Mark Kenshan warned them that non-military men would look at their service from two perspectives.
Some will look at them with admiration because they were thundering and were in exotic places.
Others will wonder if it is hidden under the mask of a cruel vet," said Kenshan, who was fighting in Iraq and who, when he came back, took a high government position in Washington.
As he was looking for work, he said he felt that some of the interviewers had asked carefully whether he could withstand the tension of responsible work in Washington immediately after the war.
Kenchan remembers saying to his sons, "When you talk about your service, you have to count on the negative effect."
The distress experienced by the military is partly due to the American indifference to war.
Victory in the field of combat is rarely praised by a country that is not familiar with the army and sees little direct benefit from the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism as it was normal in the Second World War," said Lieutenant General at the resignation of David Bernow, who ordered US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public is mainly focused on the depth of the suffering of the soldier.
The troops estimate the number of returns they have made, the number of associates they have lost, or the amount of losses they have lost.
The army faces increasing pressure from supporters to fight rape
This week, at the historic court hearings, it is necessary to decide whether 28 men and women will be charged against the armed forces against non-violence.
If not, hundreds of claimants will be equipped with the following.
The 25-year-old Elizabeth Lyman first class and 11 weeks of pregnancy, according to her claim, was raped by her servant at night.
It was in October 2008, she returned to her barracks at Miramar airport, north of San Diego after dinner, and met a male attendant carrying a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could go to her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag," says Lyman.
But the tehasa harvester took her fears away.
I thought, "No, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I'm sorry I didn't listen to my instinct then."
A few minutes after they entered Lyman's room, the man came back to her, kicked her and raped her, she claims.
This week, 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel will be forced to wait for the court ' s ruling at a historic hearing to be held in Arlington, Virginia, and decide whether the claim they filed against former Minister of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rasmfeld will be brought before the court.
The claim claims that Gates and Ramsfeld were unable to cope with widespread violence in the army in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The claim made by counsel Susan Berk from Washington, D.C., initially included 17 claimants, but grew to 28 months later, 25 women and three men, all claiming to have been raped or threatened by employees and that the army had not duly investigated, prosecuted or rendered adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Berk says she's focused on the top of the army because the problem is starting with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are those people who can destroy the cult of violence?
Berk also said that she had been contacted by some 400 other victims in February, many of whom could participate in future demands.
Her strategy: instead of collecting all the claimants in this case -- putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak -- she'll open up a lot of cases if she needs to support the pressure.
A defence team from the Ministry of Defence under the leadership of Federal Prosecutor Neil McBride has taken steps to end the case.
The judicial documents received by Newsweek reveal a protection strategy, mainly that former or current soldiers are unable to make claims by the army for damage done to the armed forces.
The Federal Government is not responsible for the damage caused by persons in military service by the Doctrine of the Supreme Court of 1950.
“The alleged damage relates to the risk associated with the military service of the complainants”, the documents say.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially forbidden to participate in the fight, this division exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear line of front.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the war zone.
As a result, 150 women soldiers were killed between the two wars, two thirds of them in battle.
It is also time for the armies to become modern, says Berk.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her claim, three others are prepared.
In the Yeel legal school, the Veterans Legal Service Seminar prepares a case against the four largest military academies in charge of promoting the feminist atmosphere.
The separate non-commercial association of American war veterans in Vietnam is preparing a complaint against the army, where the diagnosis of "changes of personality" that are the victims of violence to remove them from service is a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Anu Bhagvati from the human rights group of the Organization of Action for Women of War.
Her group filed a complaint in December against the Office of Veterans, accusing her of discriminatory treatment of people who claimed to have been threatened with sexual violence during the service.
Nine separate bills proposing a number of measures were introduced to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, 3,158 attempts to rape were reported by the Prevention and Combating Sexual Violence Service of the Ministry of Traffic.
However, it is known that attacks are often not reported, and according to the Pentagon ' s own estimates, this figure is about 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
This report, published in March, also examines the percentage of court cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of known cases were brought before the court - twice as much as in the civil justice system.
The Berk case claims that the attacks were only the first in a number of other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she reported rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell her details of rape, 11 times by policemen, doctors and commanders.
She collected a set of evidence of rape, and the blood of the attacker, from the cutting to the hand, was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was sitting in front of a judge at a hearing asking if she had had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six men gave a positive characteristic to the accused, who was finally justified.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was a rose now - I ran out of the courtroom with a scream."
"They put me in the psychiatric ward, and when I left, I remember my commander saying, "It wasn't his judgment, it was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to contact a military psychiatrist who finally diagnosed her personality change, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was relieved with a negative wording, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether the case is brought forward by Lyman and her associates on the ground is a difficult matter, says John Terly, professor of law at the law school of the University of George Washington.
However, he notes, "I think they are able to move forward."
They and the verdict stand between them and the doctrine that has been criticized since it came.
I've been criticizing Doc Ferres all my life.
The army has remained for decades because it does not have the incentives and restraints that impose responsibility.
He adds, "A lot of odds against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when ordinary people want to fight.
If hearings are not in their best interests, Berk, the plaintiff's lawyer, will collect hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until reform is achieved," she said.
Or until we die, depending on what happens earlier.
The wall has eyes: How do researchers study you in Facebook?
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Bravik was an ordinary guy who presented his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Bravik, who was aware of the mass murder in Norway in July, who had killed 77 people, appeared at his first open trial.
Although Bravik was able to act alone, he was far from alone in the network: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, in association with millions of nationalists who supported legal groups on social networks.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how do you find them?
It's easy to go into Facebook.
"We understood that they would be better off," says Jamie Bartlett, the author of a recently published report on the European cyber-populism of the British Research Centre DEMOS.
The availability of personal data on Facebook is so great, says Bartlett, that researchers could easily use the advertising tool of the site to identify the necessary demographic group with scientific accuracy - that marketing scientists have been doing so for several years.
The Bartlett team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then promoted them, but instead of showing a new group or diet product, the advertising offered the user a survey of their level of education, violence and optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues, more than 10,000 participants were able to question the very right parties in 11 European countries, even without leaving the office.
"It's a completely new way of doing research," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not so devastating: online right-wing parties are most often the young men of the gender who are not satisfied with immigration.
But suddenly, “those who combine their online activity with offline activity are smarter, more democratic and less aggressive than those who are just looking for a monitor.”
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, researchers and politicians use the website to study the world wide, from health issues to social trends expressed in 'Laika', wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, adding on average three entries per day, Facebook's "super-current information" is a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles entitled 800 per cent in the title over the past five years.
For some researchers, the Facebook site provides an opportunity to study people who can't get to the streets with blockposts.
"Before, if you wanted to question people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You should join the party, and they would never accept you," said Bartlett.
"The Facebook excludes all of this - you're addressing them directly."
Others say that this site could identify and explore social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues showed that students who discussed their drinking promotions in Facebook were significantly more at risk of alcoholism than those who were silent about it.
Moreno assumes that students' peers, such as their community teachers, could monitor the site and interfere to help a student who is too often updating his drinking status.
"You can't solve the problem without finding it," reported Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author Moreno and director of the Centre for Children's Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute.
"We've found a way to identify children from a risk group they wouldn't find otherwise."
Facebook is also constantly collecting data about its users.
The Data Processing Unit processed statistics on relations and Valentine's Day, the occurrence of voters in mid-2010 as well as the National Happiness Index (mostly using the information available to them, the cyberfreedom champions have long insisted that the site should make its extensive collection of data available to the public for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for playing in Scrabble with another, thousands of miles from you, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become participants in a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict rules for offline research, online data are generally available.
"I don't think that many users would even think that the researcher could observe their profiles," says Neil Selvin, sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about the study he conducted in 2006 using public student pages in Facebook.
"As far as they could imagine, it was just between them and their friends."
Then there is a question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that the object of the study is entirely honest.
There is no way in Facebook to find out how much information in the profile and on the user page is true.
"What you're talking about in Facebook and what you're doing outside Facebook is two absolutely different things," says Selvin.
That is why, despite the years of his work in the field of technological research, Selvin believes that the blockage and handle are still the best research tools available.
"Nothing can replace the entry into real peace and communication with real people," he says.
"Societal research is supposed to be about social, and most of the social is still going offline."
Cold and inhuman: Anders Bering Bravik will appear publicly for the first time
Anders Bering Brawiek, a man who was aware of the double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during the first public appearance in Oslo.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Emperor of Templiers of Norway," he told 500 of those present in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I confess my actions, but I don't acknowledge my guilt."
Judge Torkyel Nesheim interrupted Bravik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Bravik a chance to use this hearing as a platform for expressing his own views".
For the same reason, he refused to allow Bravik to speak with him in advance to the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Bravik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims visited the hearing.
Some were hoping to see Bravik in the eye, while others were convinced that he was trapped.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," told the Norwegian NRK channel one of the survivors of the Utah.
"It was uncomfortable, but it became a little easier for me personally after I saw and heard the suspect."
The dark suit and blue tie Bravik kept calm and professionalism throughout the entire hearing and looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors when he entered and came out of the building.
Despite Bravik's strange idea that he was part of a major resistance movement, the judge decided that he was not mistaken and said that there was no evidence that he was acting with his associates.
Some may be comforted by the fact that the attacks of 22 July appear to be the work of one extremist, not a group of radicals.
But that doesn't automatically reduce the misery and contempt that the whole nation now feels.
"I'd like him to look like a monster, but it's not like that," said one victim's relative.
"It would be much easier if it were."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview showing at the theater this week
After Steve Job's death on 5 October, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing a technical genius as the Great Designer of Modernity.
But what Apple fans can view as the greatest opening in a recently discovered interview, which they recalled in advance of preliminary indications on the main markets this week, was how much this creative mind was understood in business processes and production technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer and a hippie, but he was also a skilled producer and a modernist of the production process, who believed that many business leaders were suffering from “the disease to think that a really great idea was 90 per cent of the work... [but] a great idea separates a huge amount of skilled work from a large product.”
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley created the Triumph Nerds television series on the appearance of a personal computer, and he spent more hours with Jobs for a unique long conversation.
By then, it had been about 10 years since Jobs had been expelled from Apple, and he had already been working in his new computer company NeXT in anticipation of the massive development of the Internet.
While a small part of the Kringley interview was used in Nerdah, he said the original interview was missing during transportation.
Only after Job's death was a full VHS copy found in the director's garage.
This film, a little edited, was the basis for a 68-minute film by Steve Jobs: A Lost Interview that ends in Landmark Theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hatred for detailed interviews, Jobs here seems unusually willing to present his technological philosophy and business strategy.
And incredibly thoughtful.
At four different times during the interview, there are large intervals between questions and answers - 10-15 seconds of thought, where Job obviously weighs his thoughts to say more accurately.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism comes out on the surface, where he seems to be upset with the Kringley issues that make him more quickly to go into issues or issues of greater importance.
In the pre-Pixar era, the iPods and iPhones The Lost Interview has something more prophetic when Jobs evaluates what he sees as different companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of future information technologies.
One thing is to read about Job's death assessments, but there's something vulnerable and inspiring in Job's, which we see here, an alarming dreamer on the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things might and should be.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A brief summary of the seven significant conclusions of the Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"All the time in the business, I kept asking, "Why are you doing this?" And the answers that you're going to get are, "Oh, that's just how it's done."
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks about business very deeply.
That's what I knew.
Job continues to describe in detail his efforts to streamline reporting in Apple.
Disturbed by the way in which costs often started from “standard costs” that were taken from the roof and then driven by “exactness”, he created an automated structure that ensured that they could track business expenditures from one end to the next.
About the joke over the Pope:
Job's detailed account of the blue box that he mastered with Steve Voznjak, a device that allowed people to break the phone and call for long distances free of charge.
A lot has been written about the device before, but Job's euphoria here describes the blue box as an act of granting authority is contagious.
He relates how he and Voznjak tested the box using a telephone machine, ordering a conversation and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until as many stations were connected.
"We've covered the Earth's half-life once, and you've been screaming in a phone machine, and it went into a minute later in a neighboring phone machine," said Jobs with a smile.
"We were young, and all we've adopted is that we could have mastered something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We two knew a little bit, but we could have mastered a little thing that could control a lot of things -- that was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple could ever come up without it.
Jobs continues to describe in detail one famous exit that he and Voznjak have made in practice by calling to the Vatican through the blue box at midnight and by requesting the Pope's phone, from every effort to copy Henry Kissinger.
When various members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned at night to talk to an American diplomat, the two of them were angry just before the Pope himself was picked up to answer the phone.
On the love of technology (and the cold reputation of Bill Hulett):
When he was 12 years old, he was hunting for spare parts to collect the frequency meter, and he found Bill Hullett in the phone book and called him.
Soon after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a summer job at Heulett Packard.
"It had a strong impact on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it formed my view that such company and how well they treat their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP staff who visited the research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer”.
He was sized with a suitcase, he had a small monitor with an electronic-side tube, and I fell in love with him.
I used to drive to HP when I was a teenager, and I swirled around that car and wrote programs for her.
About improvised innovation:
In a number of places, Jobs talks about the invention of new products during the summer.
When he went out to sell a chain of mounting plates, a buyer asked him to collect a whole computer.
Working all 30 days in credit, he had to think about both the collection and the delivery of ready devices.
Later in Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced when developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the angry disputes... they yelled at me that it would take five years to collect a mouse that would cost $300, and I was on my throat, and I went and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
About large energy-loss companies:
Long before he led Apple's reinstatement, Jobs had just predicted that many industry leaders would fail to see the situation and would lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you're working at IBM or Xerox, so you're doing a better copy or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company doesn't get any more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, thus [these kinds of people] who eventually lead companies, and people who make products are forced out of the decision-making area.
The genius of the product that led to this monopolistic position is exacerbated by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products - the skill required.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could capture the entire information technology industry.
He could be ten times more, could be a Microsoft 90x...
They were defeated by victory.
About innovation as a form of art:
"The great idea of a large product separates a huge amount of skilled work... when you twist a great idea, it changes and grows."
You'll know a lot about her densities.
There are compromises that you need to go to - some things you can't make electronics, glass, robots or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your head -- these concepts, combining them all together...
In the end, everything is going to taste -- it's going to try to express itself in the best way that people have ever produced, and then it's going to try to bring it to what you're doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've always been ashamed to come up with great ideas.
Part of what he did to the famous Macintosh was that the people who worked on him were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who became the best information technology specialists in the world.
If not for information technology, they would do amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are dining with opponents of the Health Act while the court is considering the case
On the day the Supreme Court met in private to discuss the political issue, would it listen to the repeal of the Health Act of President Obama, his two judges, Antonina Scalia and Clarence Thomas, honoring the lunch sponsored by the legal firm that would dispute the case before the Supreme Court.
This was the case last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petition.
One of the agenda cases was an application supported by 26 states contesting the urgent health review adopted by the Congress last year, which brought together conservative activists from all over the nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; in fact, the debate is expected to resume for 5 1/2 hours in March 2012, and the outcome will most likely be a stir in the presidential race, which will be in the worst place by the time the trial is announced.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the Health Act should be abolished will most likely be Paul Clement, who was the deputy Attorney-General during the chairmanship of George W. Bush.
The legal firm Clementa, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two thousand companies that helped to sponsor the annual federalist community lunch, a long-standing group that consistently advocated conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored lunch is one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, who has a huge financial interest based on gravity.
The lunch was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the court hearing.
He attended, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans of the Senate and a well-known opponent of the Health Act.
The first guests for lunch, Scalia and Thomas.
Nothing new: two judges have been visiting the activities of the Federalist Society for many years.
And that does not go against ethical standards.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were to obey, they might fall under Principle 4C of the Code, which states: “The judge may visit the charitable activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge may not be the rapporteur, honourable guest or referred to in the programme of such activities”.
However, the apparent proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two legal firms in this case, as well as to a company with high financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethical activists in the Government.
"It is a shocking violation of ethics and the indifference to the code that contradicts the statements of some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the General Court.
"The judges have been drinking and having dinner on official cash collection with lawyers whose cases are now before the court."
Their presence and assistance in the collection of money for this event undermines all statements of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say they are very willing to mix court cases with groups of federalists.
And Thomas' wife, Ginny, is a famous conservative activist.
Furthermore, the conservators claim that this is a ethical issue for Judge Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the main legal service in Obama ' s administration when the first legal objections to the law were filed at the Court ' s level of the first instruction.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse to listen to this case because she was too involved in the protection of the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan didn't show anything that she was going to do.
Boeing receives a record 18 billion-dollar aircraft order
The company Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777 wide-fledged liners and may order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, a transaction amounting to over $1 billion.
It is hardly news that the company receives an order for 50 units of its product.
But this is an important event when this company, Boeing Co., and the pre-quantity price for all these 50 aircraft is $18 billion.
So important is where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, growing gold, lived future orders on airplanes.
The Chicago company, published Monday, estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest in the dollar equivalent order for commercial aircraft, 50 Boeing 777 two-pass aircraft.
An incredible order came from the company Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has the opportunity to buy 20 more aircraft, which will raise the total pre-quantity price to $26 billion, Boeing said at the Dubai Aviation 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, so-called Dreamliner, which can enjoy significantly better fuel savings and passenger conveniences.
The pre-quantity price for six aircraft will be over $1 billion.
"It's really very good for Boeing," said the analyst Morningstar Nile Dior.
"The quality of these specific buyers is quite high."
Many of the Middle East aircraft are owned by oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, they do not only have money to pay for aircraft, but also increase in fuel prices, which usually harms airlines, as this is one of the biggest cost items, not so much loss, because the country earns money at high oil prices.
It's important because they're less likely than other airlines to cancel the aircraft's order when the prices grow, Dior said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The order of Emirates strengthens Boeing's leadership in the market for large-scale fluorescent aircraft and helps to prevent the attempts by Airbus SAS to reach its control with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory on the plane took place four months later after Airbus stated that it would delay the debut of the largest A350, which competed only once from 777-300ER.
He delayed the start to increase the load after the buyers had needed to increase the load load and the distance of the flight.
Boeing Co shares grew by 1.5 per cent to $67.94.
Mexican President's sister apparently lost her vote in Michoakane
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug traffickers helped the opposition Fausto Valeho from the IRP in the pre-election race.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seems to have failed to implement her application to the place of Governor Michoakana during the severe government elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers had helped to turn the race off for one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Valeho, a leader in the Western governor's position, or IRP, is the leader in the race.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday is alarming not only for Michoakana but also for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview the next day after the resurrection.
"They frightened our candidates, our election workers... they caught the polling ears, put obstacles... and forced people to vote" for the IPR.
IPR managed Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
It prepares a return, and the victory in Michoakan is an important step in this attempt.
IPR hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Valého, it seems, was just a little bit of a Calderon who was leading the scores until the day of the election.
Kalderon, a candidate from the National Action Party, or the PND, headed by her brother, refused to recognize Valeho as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate from the left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or the DRP, which now belongs to the governorate chair, has come to the third – a serious defeat for the divided and unsuccessful left in front of the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Valého, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denied contact with drug dealers and called on other candidates to recognize the results.
In Michoacane, drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines have long been dominated.
This is the native state of President Calderon, and he chose Miquelon to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence is still continuing.
The mayor of the PND was killed a week before the election, when he protested against Luis Maria Calderon, and several candidates left the local pre-election race for fear.
For the IRP, however, as terrible as the elections in Michoakan would be, the victory would be a driving impulse of the party.
The man who was supposed to represent IPR in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Njeto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Valého and said, "I think this victory should be very exciting in the foreword of next year."
ABR convinces Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank committed India and China to helping save the eurozone from the European debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term decline that would stop the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of the ABR Office in Manila, said that the two most rapidly developing economies should “do all they can” in order to accelerate the recovery of the currency block through either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the countries of BRIC were looking at Europe ' s " impartial" difficulties and said that Asia ' s financial support on the side with European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term decline in the global economy.
"It's all up to us."
"That's why anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but she can't be vulnerable."
"So if China and India can help, it has to be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's loan funds have grown threateningly, and both Italy and Greece's prime ministers have resigned.
The developing debt crisis in Europe gave rise to fears that it could bring the world economy back to recession, and called on leading developing economies to gather together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Neg predicted that any Asian assistance would be provided through IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation -- such as the purchase of the EU financial assistance fund -- provided enormous strength to the Asian partners in the negotiations in Europe.
Anand Sharma, India's Minister of Trade, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a decrease in exports and a reduction in foreign capital.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We have great tasks, and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a possible option, it's a mandatory condition, because where we find work for tens of millions of our young and girls."
Others argue that for developing economies such as India, there is no point in helping rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutos Warsaw, professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be very difficult from a political point of view to assist Europe for 1.2 billion Indians, of whom about 800 million live for 2 dollars a day or less.
"At some point they will know that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and travel to the sea for holidays, and it will not be understood well," he said.
Lee Howell, director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India ' s reserves should be used to include Greek large and well-paid public sector workers in poorly organized, loss-making enterprises, such as railways.
Mr. Neg said that the eurozone crisis was threatening “significant direct consequences” across Asia.
The ABR forecast of 7.5 per cent of economic growth in Asia in 2011/12 has now faced “decreasing risks” due to the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets needed to make “emergency plans” to protect themselves from the decline and significant flows of capital from their economies.
Pentagon ' s terrible warnings on potential reductions in defence costs
The Minister of Defence, Leon Panettet, put it into effect on Monday at the Congress, warning that the expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and cause a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civilian assembly.
The Pentagon is already undergoing a $450 billion reduction in the coming decade, but it is now afraid that additional reductions of $600 billion or more may be inevitable if the Congress is unable to reach a cost agreement.
"The consequences of these reductions will be devastating to the Ministry," Panette told senators John McKain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina in a letter.
He said that the inability of Congress to accept the budget agreement and resulting in the so-called sequencing started a total reduction of 23 per cent and the termination of many new projects.
"This severe reduction, applied so thoughtlessly, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects inconvenient -- you cannot buy three quarters of the ship or building -- and will seriously damage other attempts to modernize," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We will also have to fire many of our staff and, since the reduction will be made so quickly, we will almost probably have to fire the staff in order to achieve our goals."
"These changes will undermine the trust of those who support our army and cause serious damage to the military."
The cuts will eventually affect the military, Panette said.
"Although military funding in foreign emergency operations has not been directly affected by the sequencing, military achievements are seriously affected by a major budget collapse," warned Panetta.
“The contract staff will be reduced to complete the cancelled contracts and the supervisory treaty that supports the army.”
“The staff will be reduced, resulting in late payments by military suppliers, and legal and political support will be disrupted.”
Two senators wrote to Panette 10 days ago, requesting details of possible consequences of automatic reductions in the Ministry of Defence.
"As a result of the sequestration in the Ministry of Defence, the United States will soon fall as the world's leading military state."
"We are firmly opposed to these draconian actions," the senators reported in a joint statement on Monday evening when they issued a letter to Pannetta.
"It's not the way we can live, and it's not the way we have to impose ourselves."
"Secvester is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and this cannot be allowed to happen."
Whether the letter of the Panel or the last warnings of the senators to the budgetary compromise or to strengthen calls for the release of the Pentagon from reductions will be seen later.
The Panel was absolutely honest about the possible reductions, although it had been working in the Pentagon leadership for many years after carrying out budgetary experts at Congress and the White House, and was aware that it faced a difficult choice.
At the press conference last week, the Minister of Defence drew a picture of what might follow -- a cloudless but nuclear army.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a team without a pulse."
"It's the wings of a plane without enough trained pilots."
"This is a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panette said in her opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from an unstable spirit of battle, a poor readiness and unable to fight against potential enemies."
"In fact, it encourages aggression."
In the annex to its letters to McCain and Graham Panette, he highlighted new details of how “reductions produce significant operational risks: slowing the response to crises, conflicts and disasters; seriously limiting our ability to be the first to deploy and respond worldwide; and leading to unacceptable risks in future war operations”.
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could face obstacles, including those already tested, and some only at the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single impactor F35, a new bomber planned, a new generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal warship and a new ground-based vehicle needed by the Army and the Marine infantry to replace lobster.
The further development and testing of F35 could save $80 billion over 10 years, but its supporters said that this was a vital step to improve and counter potential threats to China and other opponents.
How to Cope With Lies
The fledgling view of the latest headlines shows how serious and widespread lies and lies are in everyday life.
The candidate for Presidents of the Republics of Herman Kane is accused of sexual harassment by several women; each party accuses the other of lying.
The Administration of the University of Pennsylvania was charged with false testimony because they claimed to hide that the retired football coach raped the boys.
Last week, French President Nikola Sarkozy was arrested when he told U.S. President Barack Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a liar.
The lie destroys careers and shocks countries.
The Congressman of New York and Internet Exhibitor Anthony Weiner turned out to be a fool, denying their achievements, which was quickly rejected by irrefutable evidence.
The former candidate for President John Edwards was charged with financial harassment during a campaign related to the cover-up of non-marriage relations.
And again, none of those living at that time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, who lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Levinski during his second term in office.
The history of fraud in school and college exams is an ordinary matter.
There have been instances when teachers gave students responses to tests in order to have a good assessment of the results of their activities.
Teachers who are to teach the opposite are sending a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we deal with?
In one day, as research shows, you may lie between 10 and 200 times.
It is now assumed that much of this is a lie in salvation.
Another study showed that unknown people lied three times in the first 10 minutes of dating each other.
The identification of a lie or an invention of a lie is a necessary skill for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike the room game, such as the charades where it is necessary to call "Emmet!", the discovery of a lie is a serious direction of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities dealing with comprehensive research projects, especially on psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths about the lie have been disbanded.
Liars look in the eye.
They don't always stop, sneeze, red or sneeze.
It should not be concluded that it is difficult for liars to notice and unveil.
The experienced liar can come to the truth by observing the structure of the allegations, the minima, the structure of issues and the temporary characteristics.
I have spent several years researching scientific discoveries in a broad and constantly growing segment of knowledge of lies, and it is clear that finding a lie is a modern skill that is easy to learn and that helps to guide in our difficult world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
Good liars are best able to read, make them feel uncompromising, manage their own emotions, and feel intuitively how others view them.
We know from the study that extravagance is more common than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, while women lie about others, usually to protect someone's feelings that married people are less familiar with their partners than non-wifery (but the lie that they say is most often sudden).
We also know that if you are perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
What do you mean, someone's lying?
First, watch your object's normal behavior.
It's called "the definition of baseline."
This helps to ensure a starting point for further assessment of changes.
Watch for the pause, laughter, voice characteristics of your object.
You would do well to know if a person is always beating his feet in a normal state, then you will not make unfair accusations when you see a kicking in the middle of a meeting.
Then find a group of fraudulent verbal and nonverbal practices.
Treat these groups as red flags, not as evidence of deception.
Liars can record the upper part of their body when they try to remember their history, they can put their feet towards the door, turn to the exit, change their poses in a certain way, or demonstrate “facilitation after interview” — this excessive breath of relief and change of the pose when all the difficult issues are behind.
Investigators often fake an end-of-question signal to just look at this relief after the interview.
So look at the speech of your object.
It is known that Scott Peterson withdrew and used his time, claiming that his murdered wife was alive, which led to her search throughout the country.
Entrepreneurship can also use distance: "I didn't have sexual relations with this woman... Miss Levinski" or repeat the difficult question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely catchable.
Someone can use the "qualification language" when they answer the difficult question, "Well... I really say... how much I know... how much I know."
This makes the response more emotional than actually, and is often a red flag.
There is no magical means to identify a lie, but it is possible to acquire the ability to detect deception.
These skills will increase everyone’s chances of not being a victim of professional and personal experience.
The dispute plan for the construction of the pipeline needs to be reviewed after the United States threat to delay its approval
A few days later, after Obama's administration threatened to postpone the approval of the planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- causing the wrath of trade unions, but calming environmental protection -- the company that is going to build pipelines claims to be willing to review the project to resume its work.
TransCanada reported on Monday evening that it would withdraw the planned pipeline from the environmentally sensitive area of the Sand Holms in Nebraska and be sure that the project would still receive approval.
The company announced this decision at a press conference in the capital of the state of Nebraska.
The official representative of TransCanada, Alex Purbas, said that the company remained confident that it would eventually receive approval for the pipeline, although with another route.
This follows the State Department ' s statement last week that it will postpone a federal-level decision on the project until it explores new possible routes that do not affect the Nebraska sand dunes and the Ogalala aquifer, a huge groundwater reserve.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska.
The new environmental expertise commissioned by the State Department will most likely respond to the decision by 2013, after the elections next year, although the authorities denied that the decision involved policy.
In a written statement last week, Obama appealed to the State Department and expressed his support.
The oil pipeline should be 1,700 miles long from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He has to transfer 700,000 barrels a day from Albert's province to the oil pipelines in Texas.
To accomplish this, he has to cross six states.
It is hated by environmental defenders, but it is loved by trade unions who look to some 20,000 oil pipeline-related jobs.
But Nebraska legislators, who oppose the plan, are considering a bill to speed up the movement from the Sand Holms area and the Ogalla Aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study by the State Department of Environmental Impact showed that the project would only have a limited negative impact on the environment, but a source in the energy industry said that the Department ' s auditor had ordered a separate expert on the procedure of consideration, focusing on two issues.
One is a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Eliott, who was a adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, a conflict of interest for the programme.
Another was the choice of a company that was hired to carry out an initial study which was inappropriate because it was related to TransCanada.
At Patty LaBell, she was tried for allegedly causing the child to be terrified.
The family in New York claims that Patty LaBell's disco-wild started to blow up their home in Manhattan, scarring their little daughter to such an extent that she was frightened.
"Lady Marmalade's tyranny has frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she has carried on "a change of personality, a disturbance of sleep" and "a strong fear of strangers," says her family in the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
This happened on 10 November last year, when Kevin Monk, his wife, the educator of the children, Rosanna, and Geneva were about to travel on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was hunting the car, Rosanna Monk went down to the lobby of the building on the Riverside bulwark with their luggage, took Geneva.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped by the door and dropped her daughter a half a minute.
"Someone came back to me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said "yes" and I went to pick her up," she said.
LaBell was furiously making a statement to a pregnant woman.
"She aggressively said, "You shouldn't have left your daughter at the door," said Rosanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She got angry and began to use abuses -- the word "C" and the word "F" -- in increased tone...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water from a bottle on me.
She said that Geneva had a rash.
"I told this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the baby.
LaBell came to the mother -- who was still holding Geneva -- and her escort had to hold her in the waiting car, Rosanna Monk said.
The little girl cried so much that she was bored, she added.
Later, the family sent LaBell a note of apology, but she didn't get the answer.
Lawyers and representatives of LaBell are not responsible for the comments.
The amount of compensation for the damage is not reported, but family lawyer Sam Davis said that he had taken the case free of charge and that the family was planning to spend any money that would benefit children with cancer.
"The goal is to make Patty LaBell take responsibility for his actions," said Davis.
"This behavior is totally unacceptable, especially with regard to a child's educator now with an 18-month-old child on his hands."
Climate problems have slowed the economy
During the first year of the rule of Mario Lopez in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labour market had grown, foreign financing had decreased and the economy had been weakened.
2011 is the year that will enter the economic history of Sinaloa as the first year of the Government of Mario Lopes Valdez, also called the year of change, which has given rise to great hopes for economic development, but given the adverse climate conditions at the beginning of the year, there has been no growth, but a decline in the main indicators of economic development has been recorded.
Low temperatures in February not only led to the loss of millions for the agricultural sector but limited the potential for the growth of the public economy by reducing economic activity by a total of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly due to the historical fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which had an impact on the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to the report on the areas affected by the frosts provided by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 835,582 hectares were affected, 78.03 per cent of which had been affected in whole and 21.07 per cent had been affected in part.
The decline in economic activity led to a steady increase in unemployment in the state until November, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, in the first three quarters of the population, a rapid increase in unemployment was recorded, from January to March 55,053 of Sinaloa ' s population were unemployed, from 4.53 per cent of the economically active population to 5.28 per cent in the second quarter, and from July to September, it continued to grow to 6.19 per cent, which in turn represents more than 74,000 people in Sinaloa ' s unemployment population, which was 18.969 per cent higher than the first half.
Liquidity reduction
The unemployment rate in Sinaloa over the year is marked by many factors, for economist Gerardo Lopes Servantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the increase in unemployment can be explained in detail by actions taken in public policy.
"What we see now is an increase in unemployment associated with several factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market in order to limit the resources imposed by the law that was adopted at the congress to combat money-laundering, because people who have illegal dollar ownership are simply working with them, investing and using them in something," he said.
Immigrant status
Lopes Servantes said there was still a demographic factor in the growth of unemployment.
“The number of people who leave abroad for work has been limited in the United States, mainly because of the difficulties of entry and, secondly, because once they have gone, they are already experiencing a lot of difficulties in finding work, so that a group of people remains and demands jobs here, in the state, as a result of rising unemployment levels,” he said.
Violations of formal requirements
The analysis of Sinaloa ' s labour market is getting worse if a large number of violations that prevail in the workplace are reported by INEGI to be 60.38 per cent of the active population of the state, without being referred to as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and abuses in construction, another reminder of work in the State was presented with low wages; in the State, the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was 5,352 pesos, much below the country ' s average, representing 7,375 pesos.
Abbreviation of FDI
In addition to the fall in economic activity and the high unemployment rate in 2011, the largest flow of foreign direct investment over the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, was $630,697 from January to July, representing a fall of 87.74 per cent compared to $5,143,312 during the same period last year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development has recorded a total of 17,280,000 investment pesos during the year, which mainly came to service companies.
Long
In the light of the economic downturn, the Government requested the approval of a loan of 3 billion pesos at a state congress, which would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, only 2,600 million pesos were approved at the local level, and no debt benefits were expected in any sector of the state economy until November.
Reactions
For business representatives in the first year of the year, the Government of Mario Lopez Valdez demonstrated a lack of government capacity.
Miguel Loredo Lopes, President of the National Chamber of Industry, said that during 2011, there was no consensus on the wishes of the various sectors, including the State Government alone.
"The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year was really low, it takes a lot of work to get the positions lost this year, we have to double our efforts in 2012, we have not been able to agree on all efforts and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new Government team, we hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
Reduction of the economy
Lopez Loredo said that events such as early freezes had stopped the state economy this year and its efficiency and growth were limited.
"The low levels of economy are the result of several events, including frost, one of the main effects was a slow economy, which is not becoming fast enough to create an economic dynamic that allows for an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and therefore we close it below our expectations at the end of the year," he said.
Revision of the direction
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that the state had to continue its most dynamic productive activity.
"In general, we have found that we have been working on this, we believe that a long-term programme must be developed to redefine the direction and economic course of the state, to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
Future work
President Coparmex stressed the importance of defining the future direction to better direct the efforts of the Government.
"In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, but there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration had demonstrated progress in its own manner of public policy.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the Government is beginning to get involved in work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government is aware that much more needs to be done," he said.
He was sentenced to 8 kilograms of marijuana.
Five years of prison and a 100-day income fine, the sentence was handed down to the citizen of Navalto for the storage of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office reported that the convicted drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valensuela Sandoval, who was convicted of a health crime, had in this case stored marijuana for distribution.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI case, Valensuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 while patrolling the street of Cyprus Valdes, before post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was behind the white truck truck, where he carried a black bag in the car box, while on the passenger seat was a small backpack, where soldiers found eight pounds [8 kg] and 23 grams [23 g] of marijuana.
For these reasons, the detainee was transferred to the Second District Court and the accused continued to remain detained at the Centre for the Legal Impact of Crime.
Contributions to work
Public work relating to programmes such as the Family, the Saving of Public Space and 3x1 for migrants is at risk of being incomplete or long delayed due to lack of funds, Miguel Angel Lopes Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development pointed out that, although the work programmes had so far developed, they were in danger, since the Government was unable to make the corresponding contributions that amounted to over 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the overall funding of all three programmes was approximately 50 million pesos, of which 25 per cent were required by the State, and so far only the Federation and the municipality had provided resources for work, so it was still possible to delay their completion.
"They have to invest almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they haven't given us any chickens when they were supposed to give us a share since early July," he said, "that we wouldn't delay, we started work and they moved very fast, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesus Agillar Paddy, the state did not make the contributions it had to make, so at the beginning of the reign of the municipality it had to make money to cover more than 7 million, which was not provided by the administration of the State.
"This happened to us in the previous administration because the state had no financial opportunity to participate, and the programmes were continuing to develop, and this year in order to gain access to these programmes, we need to find resources to cover what remains of the state," he explained.
While the State authorities had an obligation to deliver those resources, he said that the request had been made on behalf of the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to step up efforts to ensure that the percentages relating to them would come as soon as possible.
"They must bring almost 12 million dollars, and even if the year is over, they haven't given us any mines."
The Court will approve the “transmission to digital television” in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals to numbers is one of the most important changes that have been made in recent years.
The Supreme Court (HR) rejected the constitutional claims made by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, which had been so-called "to move on digital television" from 2021 to 2015, as there were no eight votes required to cancel it.
The minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mesa, felt that President Felipe Calderon had not exceeded his authority by issuing a decree detailing the action for the transition to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected because of the lack of a qualified majority of the eight votes necessary for the court to express the constitutionality or inconsistency of the decree and remain in force.
The draft statement prepared by Minister Olgo Sanchez Cordero proposed that a decree be declared unconstitutional because the regulation of the radio and television programme was a law enshrined in the Law of the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel) in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Horhe Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
On this point, both the Senate and the House of Deputies held two constitutional debates to challenge the decree and support the complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions it referred to regarding the transition to digital media.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the request of the House of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his case, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the project ' s arguments in the sense that the federal executive authority could not define the general rules of the measures to be prepared by the State administration.
"I also do not believe that this would have an impact on the autonomy of the regulatory body," and recalled that planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is relevant to the federal executive authority, which has a constitutional mandate, government.
The replacement of analog signals to numbers - one of the most important changes in recent years - has led to better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, he said, would mean the deferral of benefits from the transformation into a digital form, which includes meeting public needs, with not only a technical dimension, “as it covers economic, social, political and national security”.
These issues, he said, “needed the work of the entire system established by the principle of public economic governance, include a group of authorities that the Constitution unites into the State executive authority.”
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the digital broadcasting process and had done so through the executive authority, despite the presence of specialized technical facilities.
It cannot be concluded from this that the Government, by adopting the decree under discussion, which in any case affects the jurisdiction of Congress, ensures that the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly are complied with in the administrative sphere, he said.
At Michoacane, they analyze the possibility of counting “voice by vote”
According to the data submitted to the RBM, the difference between the first and second seats in the governorate elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 from the total number of protocols 6,074.
The possibility of counting “voting” is real with regard to the election process this year in Michoakan, where, according to data from the Preliminary Results of Elections Programme (PRF), the difference between the first and second seats in the governorate elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 from the total number of protocols 6,074.
In this light, the President of the General Council of the Miquelon Institute of Elections (IMI), Maria de Los Angeles Líanderal Saragos, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body had approved a package of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michoakan had not adopted the Constitution or the Electoral Code of the State or the Electoral Law Act, since the Congress had approved reforms shortly before the legal date of their entry into force in this electoral process and Governor Leonel Yearrange had not included his publication within the time limits set out in the Law in the Official Journal of the State, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (CFI) decided on a constitutional claim issued by the local legislative assembly and called the “invaluable and illegal” vote of the State representative for constitutional reform, since he did not have the right to “authorize or support”.
In an interview with the possibility of “voting” Maria de Los Angeles Líanderal argued that the adoption of the appropriate principles by the General Council of the IMF would enable a partial or full counting of votes by the local electoral authority.
Thus, a partial recalculation of one or more elective urns may be made provided that: the results of the protocols do not match; there is no protocol for voting and counting documents in the urns or it is not in the Chair; or where there are obvious errors or corrections in the protocol.
In addition, the overall recalculation of votes in all polls may take place when there is evidence that the difference between the proposed winner of the elections under consideration and those who received a second ballot is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from the party representative and/or the coalition that issued the second of those candidates.
The overall recalculation of votes will also be made if at the end of the normal count it is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate who took the second place is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that there is a request from the political party, whose candidate took the second place, in the case of the exclusion of electoral ballots that have been taken into account in the partial recalculation.
It should be noted that there are elections in Morelia, where, according to the PRSP, the difference between the first and the second places is only 0.16 per cent, even without considering 129 votes of 923 in total.
His Last Will
His dust will be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinam, the family confirms.
The rest of the pilot, Felipe Basio Cortez, arrived in Saltilo, his hometown on Friday evening; on Monday, a visit and a restful meat was held.
According to the family, the last will of the colonel was to dissolve his dust in the mountains of Sapalinam.
After condolences with other people who were killed in the disaster, the Basio Cortez family returned to Koaiilla capital on board an aircraft from the Mexican Air Force, and the closest people visited the ceremony at Campo Marte.
In the afternoon, the colonel arrived at an hour when his family and friends arrived on the bulwark of Naziio Ortis Garcia.
At 5:30 a.m., he visited the Santilo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and a football team who was a member of Felipe Basio during high school training.
"His wish was to return to Saltillo, and for his dust to be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinam, he always told this to his family and friends," said Sandra Cortez Basio, the sister of the pilot.
In her opinion, the Colonel fulfilled all his dreams, she believed that he was at the peak of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother who was committed to his family."
Felipe Cortez Basio left the city of Saltilo very young to enter the College of Aviation in Sappane, Halisco.
Some did not believe him, saying that he had a head even in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davil Basio will remember him as a very good man, "as soon as he came to Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him as he brought Martha Saagun to Saltillo."
He remembers that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sapphan for his relative’s diplomas, so he knows that his grandfather died by doing what he loved most in life: running a plane.
They're leading him the last time.
The weapons were fired in honor of Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortez Basio, headed by Governor Jorge Torres Lopes, the villagers and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the High Technology School in Saltillo, where he had studied in 1985 and had been successful both in his studies and in sports.
Basio Cortez died recently when his helicopter, which he managed, was violated, along with the Secretary of the Government of the Province, José Francisco Blake Morey, and six others, all representatives of the Ministry.
At 18:05, the remnant of Basio Cortez (creeded), the resident of Saltilo, arrived to be transferred to the funeral office of members of the Mexican Air Force, headed by Major James Martines, to the training school, where he was already expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Christina, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three bodies were found on the farm of the LL Cadereit
Within hours of the discovery, military authorities showed eleven persons in the media who had been detained in the same municipality for organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in various parts of the body with a gunshot shot on a abandoned farm in the municipality of Kadereit Hymenes, Nuevo Leon.
The discovery was found at 1.5 kilometres of the Cadreitt's show near Santiago, on the elevations in the municipality known as El Castillo.
Some passersby noticed that in a village house, whose wall was decorated in a runaway and brown, the door was finally opened.
Looking inside, literally three meters, they found the bodies of three people, and they immediately informed the authorities.
One of the men was dressed in a yellow football with black jeans, without shoes, and next to him was another man in a white mother.
Almost one meter was the body of another man, in red robes and blue jeans.
All three were lying face down.
According to the evidence collected there, three people were killed in another location because there was no bullet in the area.
There are signs addressed by one organized criminal group of another at the village house, as well as a number of billiards in the doors.
11 Detained in the Cadreit
The Ministry of National Security introduced 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group, which was mainly located in the municipality of Kadereit, and who were charged with kidnappings, murders, “fornication” and secret funerals.
According to the published information, on 11 November, eight persons were detained in the Los Alvero colony, and one person who was in the hostages was saved.
They were provided with three homes and telephones, requiring them to become members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another event took place on 12 November at 06:00 p.m., the military personnel took patrol trips to the village of Old Rancho in Caderate when they saw a car with two men in the living room without number.
By stopping them and inspecting them, the military found a rifle, a patrol and 18 patrols.
Later, after these statements, on 13 November at 14:00 one of their communiqués was stopped on the public land of La Prada, which, having seen the military, tried to flee.
He is charged with secret graves in the municipalities of General Teran, China and the Cadreit.
A new Italian Government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present a new Government that will face the crisis that has put that country on the brink of an economic catastrophe.
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present a new Government that faces the crisis that has put Italy on the brink of an economic catastrophe and has caused damage to the whole of the euro area.
A statement from the Presidential Court stated that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President George Napolitano to confirm that he could form the Government.
It is expected that it will present a cabinet composed mainly of technocrats, although it is unlikely that the new executive body will take its position.
Monty said he would present to the President the results of his negotiations with political parties in his attempt to form the Government.
"I want to confirm my full confidence in our country's ability to leave this difficult period," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monty did not directly say that he could form the Government, but his comments showed that obstacles had been overcome.
"The structure is now well-designed," he said.
Monty completed the process of forming a government less than three days, which was much less common, because Italy was struggling with a political and financial crisis that had raised their debt to a critical level
The administration under the leadership of the former European Commissioner Monty must approve the package of hard savings required by European leaders in order to restore confidence in Italy.
On the basis of pressure from Monti to speed up, unstable markets have established income from the BTP of Italy by more than 7 per cent 10 years, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marchegalia, leader of the Italian Employers' Federation, told reporters after meeting with Monty: "We said that we would actively support this Government."
We believe that the Government is Italy's last chance to get out of this critical situation.
Monty's chances of success were largely based on the support of Silvio Berlusconi's LDP party, which was forced to retire on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monty's efforts should lead to a good outcome," he told reporter Angelino Alfano, the Secretary of the Centralist Party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the government majority of the technocrats formed by Monty.
Parliamentary support
The new Montenegrin Government must have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to be unpopular in the harsh economy.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts may lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks increased pressure by warning that Monty's failure could be a disaster.
Monty began his consultations Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women ' s organizations.
He will finish his meeting on Tuesday evening.
Monty was appointed on Sunday to Napolitano, which allowed for a very rapid transition to response to the crisis.
After a brief break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would retire, Italy's debt value has now reached a critical level in the background of uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would succeed.
Saving Italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for modern eurozone financial defenders.
Monty said that his Government would exist until the next elections for 2013, despite widespread projections, that policies would only give him time to reform before appointing new elections.
Monty said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the main parties insisted that he should be made up only by technical experts, evidence of their discontent with the financial situation.
Political sources have reported that mutual mistrust and disagreement of parties make it difficult to include political figures.
More Spanish gaming experience than Tikos
Of the 22 players reported in Spain, ten have already played 50 international matches.
For Costa Rica, only one of the 22 claimed players played 50 matches.
A slight contrast with Costa Rica, when compared to 22 players caused by both countries for a match today at 3:05 a.m. at the San José National Stadium.
While in the world and Europe championships, the number one in FIFA's monthly rating, has a full list of Class A volleyball games, Tricolor has only Michael Uman's defender as the only one who played 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in the game against Panama (0-2) at the Rommel Fernandez.
Spanish footballers playing in the League of All Stars and Strong Clubs of the British Premier League were very active in the league and in local cube competitions this year, and they were high-level players in the European Cups and the League of Champions.
This should be added to the experience of the Spanish Fury in a complex qualification in the Euro or the World Championship.
The players of Tikos, however, have limited international experience in the area of CONCAFF, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that he is leading the list in the Spanish collecting gallop Iker Kasilis, who last Sunday against England (a match played 0-1 in London) repeats the record of former galloper Andoni Subisarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas is playing against Tricolor today and will establish a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Havy Ernández, Barcelona player, 106 matches.
Casillas and Havi were best known last week by WEFA together with another Iberian team player, Subisarret, with 126 matchrs and bomber Shalk Raul Gonzalez with 102.
Nearly a hundred Carles Puyol with 97 games.
Havi Alonso follows them from 91, Fernando Torres - from 90, David William and Sergio Ramos, both from 81, Andres Injesta - from 62, Sesk Fabregas - from 61 and David Silva - from 53.
On the side of Costa Rica next to Michael Umani, left-wing Hunior Dias with 48 matches and Bryan Ruis bomber, from 45.
Furthermore, only five crossed the border in 30 games: Caylor Avas from 31, Randall Asofafa from 32, Michael Barrantes from 31, Carlos Ernandes from 36 and Jose Luis Lopes from 35.
The rest.
More than 30 matches in Spain at Žera Pike (37), Sergio Buskets (36), Santiago Santo Casorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albíola (31).
There's Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Moore with 23.
The others didn't even get to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games, and Hordy Alba has two, in Costa Rica, Victor Bolivara's only one, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet won.
Spain's leading game is David Willa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruis was the one who brought more points twice as much than Carlos Ernandes and three times as much as Roy Moore and Parks.
Quintet included the country in the tour in honor of a 20-year career
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true'
In an exclusive interview, Viva bassist Jeff Amant from Pearl Jam said that the group was ready to give one of the best concerts the next morning at the National Stadium.
It was more than 20 years of expectations, but the group said that it was also a dream that had become a reality to play in that country.
This was a statement by the bassist and founder, Jeff Amenta, who gave an exclusive interview with Viva from Brazil last week.
The team is located in South America during the tour in honor of the twentieth year of work and on Sunday, 20 numbers will make its only stop in Central America.
On that day they will be at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with a team from Los Angeles The X and the local Las Robertas.
It's a break from the conversation, and the full decryption is available online at The Nation.
For your Costa Rica fans it's a dream that Pearl Jam is playing in Costa Rica?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream to us, too.
It's just our second visit to South and Central America, and it's all going well.
I was only in Costa Rica once -- on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
That's why we're so happy to bring our music there.
I ask this because there is some loyalty to the group; fans live in tension days before the concert.
What will you say to your most devoted fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thanks for waiting so long, and we regret that we needed so much time to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, regard it as the biggest show of the year.
Does this add some tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've been playing for the past 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We've had some great shows in San Paulo, and we hope that's what led us to this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love to take care of the Serfings and the Jungles, as far as these two things are concerned, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How'd you know about Costa Rica and her surfing waves?
We've got a lot of friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are amazing.
My friends are always going to take care of Serfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, as well as in Mexico, these are great places for Serfing, as we have learned, from people who love Serfing.
Looking at the tour, you can say you made a great show with lots of songs.
What were you planning for in Costa Rica?
Since we never played there before, we have no restriction on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show of the most diverse songs possible; we will try to play several songs from each album and present to our fans a wide variety of repertoires.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How's it going?
I think this is partly because we have nine plastics and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in tune and surprises us because it reminds us of why we loved these songs and why we could forget.
It makes the show more interesting to us, and so I think it makes it more interesting to people.
That's what you're doing 20 years of career.
Looking back, it's hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, unconditionally.
First of all, I think none of us could ever imagine that we're in a rock band and that we've been doing this for over 20 years is doing it like a dream.
We rejoice in our successes and are very excited that we can continue to create music together.
We all love each other and love to create music.
We are happy to travel to places in the world where we always wanted to go.
We're all very good at it.
What does it mean for you to be an important part of the flowering of the branch?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of large groups.
We're good friends with guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's healthy when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and it's unusual.
From time to time, one group from one city appears but much more strange when five or ten groups appear in one city at a time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at the Alice in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, and we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we were happy to be friends with all of them and to be an honor to us to be part of the sound of Seattle that came.
It is also very strange that a group of your kind stays together and in the same composition for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many groups.
First, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and secondly, we'll take care of others.
We are all very close friends and, as a result, we have also opened up the music channels that give every experimenter freedom.
We trust each other's music, and everything could not be better.
Your attitude toward the word of glory was not easy, but thanks to your success you were able to do whatever you wanted.
How's your balance?
When we grew up, it became easier to balance.
We'll take care not to be too long on the tour because it's easy to get into this game by the big crowd and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what you did, not to be famous or to be a rock star, which none of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're writing really good songs, and it was great at first.
We were a group for almost three years, and we didn't release any albums until Andy died.
It was a lot of disappointment because it's been so long, and most importantly, that we're still close friends with Bruce (Ferveser) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the group, and when I hear a song or see a photograph, I think of the incredible person Andy was, and as he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and a lot of others.
He was an amazing man, and we miss him.
The local group of Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Wedder, and that's why you chose her to open up?
Yes, the producers sent us a few videos, and this was a group that we liked more than anyone, so we can't wait to see that Las Robertas can offer a live one, and it must be very exciting.
Why do you keep changing words at Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
It's Eddy Wedder's question, so I don't know.
He's drinking it and I think he's using the first thing in his head.
Who affected you like a bassist?
They're so many.
Among the first to come to mind was Gizer Butler, John Entswell, CJ Ramon, John Dow, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukovsky...
So much that I can tell them all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the relevance of the branch despite his being no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a bit out of grange.
When I think about it, it reminds me of groups that I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that appeared at the same time, and if that's important now, I think it's great because it's music that needs to be listened to, and Mudhoney's teams now create music better than ever.
At first, your music was darker, and now it is more positive.
How would you explain this change?
That's interesting, because, I think there are some songs in the album that might seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, though they may sound a little positive.
Of both when Ed played them, I cried when I heard them, those songs were very dark.
I think when you grow up and there was some trauma in your life and you lost a family member or a friend, these events start to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect it for me.
So I think you can be a happy person and still be able to create dark music.
Peru:
Fuhimori was again hospitalized for medical examination
Former President Alberto Fuhimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, and his family doctor informed him about the loss of his muscle.
Fuhimori, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), is suffering from several diseases, including cancer of the language for which he was operated four times and under surveillance.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who was his personal physician, told TV channel N that Fuhimori would be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Aginaga said that, in his view, Fuhimori should be a candidate for the benefit of humanitarian pardon; however, he said he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He carried four operations into his tongue, lost 18 kilograms in weight, plus other diseases, such as strong erosion gastritis, iron oxides, stones in the hips, high blood pressure and blood pressure problems in the legs, the doctor listed them.
Fuhimori has been in prison since September 2007, in the National Police Office for Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 persons by the forces of the destruction of the army, which acted in secret in the first years of his reign.
Muhika is sent to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation headed by the President of Uruguay, José Muhiko, and consisting of several ministers and businessmen, will visit Mexico this Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and to begin negotiations on the political problems of the region.
Muhika will meet her Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderon, next Wednesday, the most important item in the comprehensive plan of meetings with the political, commercial and community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the schedule published by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting of two presidents in Guadalajara will be “favourable for the exchange of information on political relations between two nations”, as the South American leadership has published on its website.
According to local media, Muhika is seeking support from Calderon for Uruguay in an incident with France, which occurred when French President Nikola Sarkozy included the South American country in the tax havens of the G20 meeting in the French city of Kanan.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries remaining tax havens from the international community, a statement that called for the protest of Uruguay and withdrew for the advice of his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group set up from the most developed and developing countries, and, in fact, has had an agreement with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to accelerate the conclusion of tax-sharing agreements to leave this “serious list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development from countries that do not enjoy international tax cooperation standards.
With regard to the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004, the Free Trade Agreement (STS), which has increased trade between the two countries.
The main plumber will become three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought continuously for over 25 years to save Princess Pitch from the evil lap of Bouzer, but never before has he done this in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the girl in stereoscopic technology.
The publication, which will appear in shops around the world this month, is based on the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows to play in three dimensions without the need to use points.
"Mario is a hero who has to tell you how stereoscopy will work," said Nintendo's head of the press in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of a game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game specially designed under this platform," because so far successful products such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have been adapted to existing games.
The representative of Nintendo said that, despite the existence of 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" was a "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast-paced and mobile game.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part "simple" to attract less experienced users.
At first, most experts will go “on the second round” at the level of games that are more complex this time.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or those that only affect the depth of action but need to play in three dimensions in order to overcome various obstacles and "do not yield to optical illusions".
This Super Mario invasion in three dimensions also denotes the return of a hero to a portable console, which has not taken place since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo is mobilizing the fans of the series and repeating a successful formula from previous games, the watertighter and everyone need to walk through the dangerous abandoned platforms to free Princess Pitch.
However, the game will discover new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as the Ludji player.
The round guarantees the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Colem said on Tuesday that Alfonso Portillo ' s extradition process had begun to respond to a 70 million-dollar lease in the United States.
This is the end of the process in which Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country that demanded the extradition of Portillo to judge him there.
At the Colum press conference, he said that his decision was related to the independence of the judiciary and the executive authorities, bearing in mind that the Court of First Instance had already signed an extradition.
He claimed that during his mandate he had not “handed” to legal decisions and had taken all the extradition procedures he had ever known.
Along with Portilo Sergio Ruano Marrokin, he will be extradited for murder and serious bodily harm, as well as Edgar Estrad Morales and Victor Estrad Parades, both for drug trafficking.
What Colem did shows the executive process after all legal and constitutional courts were exhausted to prosecute the ex-heading of the State from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CSC), Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on his legal situation in Guatemala and a guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found innocent in the Q120 million Department of Defence in the course of the presidential term, which was a process of previous extradition, but the Ministry of Public Relations appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was established to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of Trinijove's social support organization are important: 6,000 young people who are exposed to social isolation have helped to cope with the difficult situations of this fourth century.
More than one hundred jobs created for this social group should be added.
The anniversary was the occasion for a ceremony held at the Fabra I Coats old factory, where more than 300 people arrived.
Trinijove came to light near the Trinity of Vela in 1986 to help young people with a lack of education, lack of work and problems with drugs or marginalization.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu brought together a large number of responsible organizations and agencies that cooperated with the association during those 25 years.
Various political representations during the elections showed the same nature of the work done by Trinijove.
Following the President of the Generality, Arthur Mass, and his predecessor, Hordi Puhol, former socialist education consultant Ernest Maragal and former mayor and current eco-socialist, Richard Goma, visited the ceremony.
There was also Fabra I Coats, the current Social Welfare and Family Adviser, Josep Luis Cleris and the Social Work of La Caixa, Haume Lanspa.
He said that Trinijove appeared in the light in a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but added that the work done so far "is a good base".
The President introduced Trinijove as an example of the fight against bad circumstances and the universal hope of people facing difficulties.
"The crisis is not new for the organization and work it has done," he said.
The captured building where mass parties were organized has been evacuated
Entrepreneurs occupied 11 of the 13 buildings on Balmes Street, 51
12 occupiers left the building yesterday at noon without fighting
It seems that the nightmare experienced by neighbors living in the house 51 on Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people left the building, which they illegally occupied and where they organized mass parties that upset neighbors, on a court decision without police intervention, yesterday afternoon.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door was changed to prevent the recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, there will be a check-in here," said the manager.
Squatters that captured 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest of them occupied all the electricity and part of the water, smashed the walls and left traces of various kinds, especially alcohol banks.
The first three floors were a place for mass banquets that lasted up to two days and upset the owners.
There is a night club right behind the building, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europe Press that since the building was occupied, its income had fallen by 80%.
The club's owner says that the building's captors brought it into an unfair competition because they sold drinks for three euros, while at the club for 10.
In addition, the discotheque owner had to respond to the noise from his neighbors, although, as she noted, the noise was not caused by the club's visitors, but by the residents of the quay and, above all, by those who attended the parties that were organized there, the frequency and intensity of which had been increased, as said by angry neighbors.
The club's owner said the inconveniences were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and for nine months now he's been "forgiving" her rent.
The City Police have also confirmed that more complaints have been received in recent weeks from neighbors.
The president of the municipal group PP, adviser Alberto Fernand Dias, demanded last week “to evacuate the building immediately in order to address the problems of coexistence and general spirit in the neighbourhood and degradation in this area”.
The popular leader explained that only one floor of the building had been occupied before summer, but in the last few months the Quatters had invaded all the floors and virtually every room and that some of them had been broken.
In this sense, he added that “it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to stand firm against the intolerance that exists in the building.”
So yesterday, policemen evacuated a building in New Barris.
At 15:30, the police went to Montral Street, 35 after receiving a phone call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountains?
Architects agree with the possibility of a competition after the announcement of contributions
The 16-door municipal competition resumed the debate on the role of Colserola in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, at the now closed-up Barcelona Capital Corporation (SCB), this administration printed a press release for Colserola.
The booklet described the mountain as a large park in Barcelona.
Moreover, this was accompanied by a comparison of the pictures with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the SCB, in 1987 the park again became aware of many as the top point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of a few not north-south-oriented but up (top)-down (sea).
The positioning of Colserol as a natural park contradicts this idea.
The prototype was not the Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild cabin in the role of Yogi bear.
That was so until the Council announced in September a huge competition consisting of 16 competitions for many other doors in Colserolu.
There's no doubt about the idea of a park under the door.
Either way, or someone wants to put the door on the field.
The question is: Colserola? Park or mountain?
Contests, and their organizational side, and their impact on the city, are the subject of discussion by all the architects of Barcelona.
This is hardly the most repetitive topic discussed when two members of this clan of elected people know each other in the elevator.
And this fact leads to one of the few similarities between what three architects of Barcelona and the scientists who were present.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayon: the meeting is appropriate
For Roland, after reaching the shoreline, it becomes “necessary” to discuss “the front of the mountain” when the proposal by Ildefon Serda, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
"You have to admit that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Besides, thanks to its excellent availability.
Colserol is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "the gate of Colserol" contains a "word hunt": we should not think about them "as to enter the park, but as to limit some areas where we must act."
The model, like Roland and Bayona with experience in urban construction, called the "intellectual task" with "some dangers".
The risks arising from the “uncertainty of public space forecast” after the experience of the 80th, which ended on the Forum’s “song of its faint songs”.
The first fear is a restriction of where one can build.
"Limiting something is the preparation of the next step" means transition.
"We need to think about new urban planning tools because current [as regards the General Capital Plan (GSP)] can lead to real disaster."
Closer to the case, Modolo believes that simplifying the Colserol Valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, not" as a purely topographic issue.
Modolo recalls that there is already work done outside Calserola, which “should not be missed beyond ears”, although he is grateful for the opportunity that Mary offers his profession to enter the project “from the very beginning”.
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a gap that allows architects to enter the debate, but “he doubts” whether this technical profile is the one that must be led by interdisciplinary teams (“success”), which should have been created: “Architors should only be a tool”.
Bayona argues that the answer to the question posed by this part is complex, since the competition rules do not cover the general type of Colserola: "There have been 16 cross-border competitions, he says, in the sense of the sea-mountain, but there is no long-term reading here to see and understand the area as a whole."
This requires, at least in his case, a decision to participate in 16 competitions.
On the other hand, the project for one door can be crossed through the program and define the project of the architect for the next door.
From your point of view, the Council can guarantee that the field directly above Ronda de Dalt must provide its entire area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the green.
The casino forgives Jonas Larrasabal and he will be released
After 72 days of settlement, a judicial representative of Red Casino forgave Major Monterrey's brother in the prosecution proceedings against him.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be released after the legal representative Red Casino has given him a pardon before the Second Criminal District Court, which conducts proceedings against the brother of Mary Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, the owner of Red Casino, Sergio Gil Garcia, published a series of photos and videos where Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded that he pay an economic contribution to allow Monterey's authorities to operate a secret operation in a mine house.
After a public conviction, the Public Prosecutor General opened a criminal case against his brother, and on 2 September he was arrested and sentenced to 30 days in prison.
After four hours before an agent of the State Ministry of Inheritance, he was sent to a temporary prison in the old part of the capital of the State.
He remained there for 49 days, following the requirements of the second order on the prohibition of movement after the prosecutor had ruled out bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was allegedly transferred to the Cadreitto for the claim of half a million peso to the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in prison with the average degree of isolation of prisoners because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue serving in a municipal prison in San Nicholas, Garze.
On 25 October, the arrest warrant was issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Horche Janes, who said that after almost two months of investigation, sufficient evidence of Jonah ' s guilt, such as 1.5 million pesos from bookkeepers in exchange for admission to the operation.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo Garcia Gomez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesin to apologize for the brother of the mayor of the region, so that he could be released in the next few hours.
During the trial, the Public Prosecutor at the Court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez whether he had compensated for the damage and which of the partners in the firehouse gave forgiveness, although the lawyer tried not to make a name.
On the basis of records 197/2011, legal pardon was given to Jonas Larrassabalu, and no statements could be made about the process that was planned against him; no damages or punishment would be required.
Following the hearing of the legal representative of the bookmakers, at almost 15:50, it was requested to release Larrasabal Breton immediately.
The justice officer, Jorge Janes, went to the prison of the municipality of San Nicholas in Garze to inform Jonah that he was legally forgiven and his case closed.
He shall also inform him of the immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionysio Pers Hakume told of the disaster in which the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven others were killed.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MST) reported that the results of the accident, during which the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora and seven others were killed, showed that the helicopter had hit the ground directly in a state of complete integrity without an attempt by the pilot to land an accident.
During the press conference, Dionysio Pérez Hakeme, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft got up, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the ship had several land contact, wings came into contact with trees at 25 meters where the means lost the flow."
He also reported that the vessel was intended for 19 persons, respectively, meeting the requirements for the carriage of persons.
He also said that studies conducted in the impact area did not indicate the existence of parts on the ground.
“The study reports that there are no components of the ship elsewhere, and that the impact has occurred in a structural integrity state.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers, which met the relevant requirements for passenger transport.
The land in this area has a decline from seven to 30 degrees.
To date, the Secretary said, chiefly, to achieve results as soon as possible; however, the study could take several months or even one year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Support Services, said that during the attack the Presidential helicopter was driven at a cruising speed and that it was on a soft rising ground.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis of the usual summer maneuver at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the owner of the SCT, Pérez Hakume, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aviation rules, the voyage was conducted under the visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have visibility during flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports identified the appropriate flight conditions when the aircraft was sent to the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, where low altitude clouds were observed.
Selected paths:
It is possible that because of the cloudy conditions, the team was looking for a lower altitude and greater visibility in the Kuernawak valley.
Place of impact.
The impact coordinates and the latest aircraft radar records are likely to coincide before the impact was no loss of control or change of direction.
Decomposition of particles in a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the impact occurred on the front and the sideline.
The dispersal of the debris suggests that the helicopter has been hit by the ground in structural integrity.
No obvious signs of fire or explosion were found:
In the disaster zone, there is still undetected evidence in the wreckage of the ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
The results of recent studies show that there could be multiple contacts with the earth.
During field work, pieces of aircraft were found at 9,200 feet above sea level, and the land had a decline from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The picture shows the sequence in which it was destroyed on its way.
The information contains facts that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had several collisions with the ground.
After a careful study in more territory than the area designated near the site of the disaster, no disbanded parts of the aircraft were found, which reinforced the assumption that the impact had occurred in the context of structural integrity.
MSS announces a gene search program
Social protection leads to research into the gene of obesity among children and young people; it is supported by ICN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Protection (MSSI) announced that it was conducting a study to detect obesity in children and young people, who had received the title “Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescents”, which would provide an estimate of the signs of overweight.
In his statement, the Head of the Biochemistry Research Unit of the Specialized Hospital of the 21st Century National Medical Center, Miguel Crus Lopes, explained that a multi-profile team of therapists, nurses, dietitologists and social workers had been gathered.
This team is assisted by specialists and graduates of the National Institute of Health (NIPH) and the Centre for Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Political Institute (NPI).
The study invites the population (whether prescribed or not) to participate in the MSSI sports centres participating in the study, in the Valley of Mexico, where every Saturday, 8 a.m. will be tested with children.
He stressed that the protocol began to run at a sports centre in Quautemoke (west of Mexico), and since 8 October, the events took place at a sports centre in Nesaualkoothle (East of Mexico).
Once the goal of attracting 500 to 600 children is reached, the study will continue at the Sports Centre for Independence (South Mexico) and, finally, at the Morelos Sports Centre (North Mexico).
He explained that the aim of this study was to understand the genetics and the importance of obesity development and to establish a risk factor for children and young Mexicans to prevent chronic degenerative diseases
On 14 November, the World Day against Diabetes will be observed, and the main goal will be to gather three thousand children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 14 with the permission and supervision of parents to complete their individual nutrition surveys.
They will also be asked about physical activity and the history of family hereditary diseases in order to avoid the risk factors leading to diseases, such as diabetes or initial insufficiency.
He explained that on Saturday, anthropometric measurements of all participants (vis, growth and extent of waist), blood pressure and glucose, fats, cholesterol and insulin and genetic analysis (to identify genes associated with child obesity) would be carried out.
Krus Lopes said that this study reflected the concerns of health professionals about the alarming increase in weight among children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 indicate that only 6 years of growth occurred: in the case of boys 77 per cent were overweight, in the case of girls 47 per cent; in the case of overweight, there was also significant growth," said MSSI specialist.
He said that the justification for finding markers was based on the fact that the country ' s population was different from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican was 65 per cent descendants of the American Indians, 30 per cent descendants of the Europeans and five per cent descendants of the Africans, and that this condition was affected by the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that the main consequence of obesity genetics was the inability of the body to burn excess energy that we consume (calorie) and it was delayed in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that it was a direct benefit for participants to provide a comprehensive assessment of children who could determine whether they had at least some excess weight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark deposits on the neck (acants) and pre-fights meant the possibility of a metabolism and even prediabetes.
The information is confidential, the doctor sends it in writing to the parents, to whom they explain all the measurements and changes in the form of life that must be made to avoid diseases.
Krus Lopes explained that there were three main causes of overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: the sitting-in life pattern, or the lack of daily physical activity, most of the day in front of the TV, and the use of transport at short distances instead of walking.
It is also due to high calorie consumption, i.e. increased use of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (tumble, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high level of fat and protein content and genetic predisposition as analysed in this programme.
UNAM Asphalt can avoid cracks
Raphael Errera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of the best quality that is environmentally and temperature-resistant.
If attention was paid to the signals sent by road cover, about 200 thousand dams would have to be repaired for each rainy season in the valley of Mexico City, said Rafael Errera Nahera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, and added that if the construction and maintenance of the asphalt road cover were correct, its quantity could be reduced or even reduced to zero.
His lecture The Technology View of the Caves read in the International Year of Chemistry reported that the laboratory for which he was responsible was developing a polymer-modified bitumen for the production of a mixture with characteristics close to the bitumen, but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Errera Nahera said that this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where the weather was extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and therefore to counter education.
He explained that bitumen, the most heavy part of oil, is the sequence of hydrocarbons molecules, some high molecular mass called asphalts, and others low molecular mass called malts, which together add to the road cover its characteristic binding behavior.
The binding behavior of the bitumen is that at high temperatures about 180 degrees it conducts itself, as liquid, at 120 very high, and at 50 degrees above Celsius it maintains almost steady condition, while at very low temperatures it becomes fragile, he said.
This means that the resistance of street asphalt is not permanent but changes during the day, depending on the natural conditions and temperature, the chemical engineer said.
The scholar Hymphak noted that the streets of Mexico were mostly covered with a soft covering consisting of six layers of material, three of which included bitumen.
Among the top layers are bitumen made of small stones dropped into bitumen and then pressed.
Every stone that makes up this cover, he said it's loaded into a bitumen.
When moving vehicles and applying efforts, this helps the forces to make a very good distribution on the road.
If it were a modified asphalt, they would be even better distributed, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt cover, he added that the last layer, called an export layer made of small stone, was actually also loaded into asphalt.
As this layer, which will contact the wheels of transport, must have more resistance than asphalt cover and provide road training.
As part of the road cover, which will receive and distribute the effort, the layer of exports also requires adequate thickness and the material from which it is produced needs to be taken into account.
The weather, especially the humidity and temperature fluctuations, were also very important factors for consideration, especially water, he said, because it had a significant impact on asphalt.
When the ground is raw, water is inundated and it is difficult to get out of it, it causes all layers of cover and thus education.
When he was educated, he said that the first layer of exports was exposed and only then affected the bitumen, but the damage did not occur instantly, which should be given attention in the first signs of ongoing repair programmes.
Also, a member of the National Research System explained that transport load was another important factor in the formation of the intestines, and therefore the thickness of each layer of cover should always be linked to the transport load and it was necessary to ensure that this requirement was met in order to prevent frequent occurrence.
Raphael Errera said that about bitumen much still needs to be studied and done, for example, bitumen emulsions that are already on the market in other countries and even help make holes with ease and without high temperatures.
What did Vale's candidate fail to become the new Miss Columbia?
An analysis of the reasons that prevented Serna Melina Ramirez from obtaining the crown of Miss Colombia.
The representative of Vale received the princess's title 14 times.
Once again, Vale-del-Kauka just wanted to get the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramirez Serna was to be satisfied that she had entered the stage of the winners with a silver crown and a chain announcing her new princess Colombia.
In the light of the result achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic won the crown and the Skipper, the department has 14 titled princesses, and Melina joins the legions of women from Vale del-Cauque, who were close to the crown, but were declared by the princesses, including Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Domingez (1949), Patricia Belini Ajala (1979), Lauren Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alsate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Layla Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Sonswell Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabel Romero (1993), Hisea Alhure Gars (2000), Catalina Althes (2007).
The question that many are now asking:
Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, which in each of the speeches showed that she had everything to become a new Miss Columbia, not just that she was elected by the Queen Police and the most beautiful person in the Vogue version -- the titles that the Queens had, for example, Tatyana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who received the crowns of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to condemn the title of the First Princess was that she was unable to give a convincing answer to the question "What book characterizes you and why?" by Martin Murille Gomez of the literary society.
She replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of culture, and I certainly think that a book that characterizes my childhood -- "The Little Prince" -- is a pretty deep book.
Today I am reading "The Crime and Punishment," a masterpiece of the world literature that we should all read; I am also reading the book of Irina Nemirovska, Russian writer, a wonderful book called "Blood of Blood."
The answer that the jury did not like because of the term “eculture” and, secondly, because it did not explain exactly how each of the cited books characterized it.
But after the ceremony Melina said that she was calm and content with her outcome: "The wise one is what must happen."
And all of you, please, read at least a little, "Small Prince" is a big book.
Among the soundy hypotheses, Vale burned out of favoritism.
The Bogota reporter suggested that, because of her preference, she met with ovations, and she was a candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Astera's culinary meeting, a visual vote for the best national costume, and Queen-Matthew), “which sparked the zeal of other candidates, caused stress to the queen, and as a result she did not shine on the stage”.
And this was noted during her first appearance in the bathroom on the Hilton Beach and during her two performances on the evening coronation.
While both of them seemed certain, it was noted that she lacked the strength and energy that the Magdalena and Atlantic representatives had demonstrated.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Milena was named a princess "means that the candidate who wins more prizes during the contest does not become queen"
In addition, the representative of Vale recently avoided press communication, and that was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Vale failed to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That is why two days before the election of a member of the international jury, Lucy Dotti said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of her country.
"One beauty is not enough for Miss Colombia, we must look not only at the outside, but also focus on public awareness before they participate in the competition, they must be involved in projects," she said.
There is also the assumption that the representative of Vale had faulted with the defects in the strawberries and fibrosis that had been seen in her life, but it was controversial, since the jury particularly noted her as a candidate with “natural beauty”, taking into account her healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
King's consultant, Horche Ernan Orosko, notes that Melina had no better body, which was even better, "but the problems of fibrosis in my life, which were not very noticeable to me, have caused her to lose her eyes in the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Oyos of Crocos believes that the mistake of the representative of Vale-de-Kauka was that she had undergone surgery.
"Operations are good, but representative Vale doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
With regard to the prize that was first held by the organizers of the National Beauty Competition, the worst prediction was last night, they said it was the factor that Raymondo gave Melin as a compensation for her lack of pleasure in receiving the crown.
Whether it is true or not, the fact that Melina today has a year of reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that allows her to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions specified directly by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, it will enter into history as one of the kings who, despite his outstanding performance at the Cartagena competition, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
That was the work of a man who met the body of Alfonso Kano.
A criminal from Kali came into history as a man who confirmed Alfonso Kano's death.
The work of these servants is key.
On 4 November, CTI Kali came into history as a man who confirmed the identity of FARC Alfonso Kano's head when comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven criminals working at the CTI, it was this week that Elizar González, a man from Puerto Tehad who had been in court for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in the towns of Choco, where he often had to spend more than five days through the jungle to reach the places where the bodies had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Vale, and after finishing his courses, he became a specialist in criminalism, where he studied the training of the skin, i.e. the laundromats and the tunicates.
On the Sunday of the Elishara operations on human identification known as Alfonso Kano, he was told to take no more than three days ' clothing.
Something big came up.
On Friday night, he arrived at a helicopter from Caucasian in Palmyra.
He knew that he would have to identify two troops, and one of them was supposed to belong to a man who led the world's oldest partisan war, so they asked him to take ten pictures of the fingerprints of Guillermo Leon Saens (his current name).
However, when he arrived from the research team to the place where the body was located, he did not know him in the outward appearance; he was very different from what was shown in the media.
He was without beards, dressed like a local farmer, without fingers, and much worse.
But prints aren't green.
Using a magnifying glass, the ink, the shovel, and the lantern, Eliezer compared the fingerprints of the body to those of the pictures.
His eyes weren't lifted: it was Alfonso Kano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Tehada asked to confirm to the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinson that he was the head of the CRA
Fingerprint Search
The recognition received from President Juan Manuel Santos Elizar González of the press conference on the operation against Cano is particularly important for the doctoral copy of Sijin from Kali.
Many people don't know what we're doing.
Dactiloscopy is a strict science, without mistake, it can play a key role in uncovering crimes.
In addition to the identification of bodies, doctors are involved in investigating crimes, such as theft and murder, and establish the identity of detainees.
In detention, many criminals have false certificates or no documents.
We take their prints and we're looking for them in the base.
The researcher said that in the case of theft, he had to bring up a piece of the wall at home, because in that place the wall was held by the hands to control the safe, the whole treasure and the money.
"It's hard to work with walls because they're not comfortable surfaces to take prints, but in this case we can take a picture of the whole continent and identify the identity of the criminal who took part in several thefts," he says.
The prints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in cases of murder.
A dead man was recently found with bottles from under the liter around him.
The investigation found that a family member could be suspected of committing a crime and, in fact, the fingerprints on the bottle coincided.
Although it does not guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was at the scene of the murder.
A doctoral specialist from CTI explained that there is a chemical or physical reagent in places where there are prints.
When they show up, a shovel or tape is used to remove them.
Thereafter, the prints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or entered into the register.
"The problem is we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians," said the CTI expert.
He explained that it was not as shown in the CSI telegram.
Just like not all the gold that shines, not everything you touch, leaves prints on you.
However, if possible, the comparison will be made.
"Disgraced People" challenge the authorities of New York
Hundreds of protestors broke camp in front of Zukcotti Square.
Some of the protestors heard the court's decision to disembark the demonstration from the square and went to the neighboring park.
The members of the Wall Street Capture movement called on the authorities of New York on Tuesday when they tried to re-enter, under the protection of a court order, in Manhattan, where they were evacuated in the light of another park of the Greater Apple.
Hundreds of protestors were buried in Zukotti Square, where they wanted to fall because of a court order that allowed the "disgraced people" to break camp in the square until the other part of the movement responded to the raid by catching the park in the north of the city where further arrests were held
"Our idea is that once the court does not allow us to break camp in the square, we will break camp somewhere else and continue the judicial fight for the return to Zukotti and through peaceful ambushes and demonstrations," said Mark Bray, a representative of the Wall Street movement.
Bray explained that the response of “distorted people” to the evacuation of the palace city, which was ordered by the mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg personally, had been brought before a court where Judge Lucy Billings issued a decree prohibiting forced evacuation from the square and allowing demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, “disgraced people” began to capture a new park located on the junction of the central streets of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Netherlands tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and which is owned by the Trinity Church.
At least an hour they could take this place, but then the police arrived and arrested some of the Protestants, although Bray could not call the exact number, but Ef said he saw several journalists who were also in the handcuffs.
The organization assures that several hundred people stood with tents in the place where the delegation of religious leaders went to demonstrate support for members of the movement, trying to act as mediator in negotiations with the police.
However, the Zukotti area, which is a private property, remains closed in anticipation of a court hearing appointed on Tuesday, which will examine the legality of the protesting morning.
Some of the Protestants who were sent there carried and distributed copies of that ruling at the same time and even gave them to the policemen guarding the area, which led to “some small clashes”, said Bray, who said that some policemen were demonstrators.
The judicial decision prohibits the authorities from evacuated members of the Wall Street movement and from forcing them to comply with “laws issued after the arrest or to prohibit demonstrators from regaining access to the park with shops and other property used earlier”.
Ms. Bloomberg told reporters that because of this court order, the city had suspended the opening of public space and the demonstrators had been informed about it, but local laws did not allow them to re-distort tent stores and sleeping bags.
A member of the municipal council had personally justified the removal of protestors from Zukotti Square in the light of the operation of about 200 arrests, and a decision was taken on this because the protesters “infringed the law”.
Blumberg said he gave the order to clean up the area because it became “the place where people came not to protest, but to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm others” because “some businesses were threatened” and neighbors were afraid of “decreasing the quality of life”.
The evacuation this morning was repulsive and showed that in the depth of Bloomberg's soul, more interest in protecting the financial interests of American workers," added a movement that condemned the mayor for “infringement of freedom of speech”.
The Wall Street authorities also indicated that they intended to organize “magnificent actions” on Thursday, in collaboration with public organizations and trade unions, to remember the last two months of protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will become Devo Maria at the special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bubble and other Canadian broadcasters, she will appear on the television program "Born of Russell Peters" on 1 December.
Canada Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen at the Big Repair, a rescuer at the Malibu Rescuers, Banny at Playboy, a woman rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will become Devo Maria at a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, together with the Crown (executor Ballad) Michael Bubble and other Canadian broadcasters, will appear on the television program "Christmas of Russell Peters" on 1 December, in the role of Mary in particular.
CTV presented today a television show in which Anderson, also known for its wide range of home porn videos on the Internet, is still depicted by her husband, the drummer of the group "Mötley Crüe" Tommy Li, dressed as the Virgin Mary, who is holding a doll in the eyes of Jesus.
In this scene Peters, a famous Canadian Indian comedian, who recently performed as the leader in the Tour "My Cruel Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Shina, appeared as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the special show CTV is attended by Canadian singer Buble, who married in Buenos Aires in late March at the Argentine model Louisiana Lopilato and who also knows a lot about scandals.
Bubble recently called American Kim Cardassian during one of his concerts in New York City.
Japan, born after the earthquake
GDP increased by 1.5 per cent due to domestic consumption and put an end to the decline that began in March.
Since March last year, Japan's economy has been paralyzed and has been relieving itself of the devastating earthquake caused by the nuclear crisis, the most horrendous catastrophe carried over by the rising sun country since World War II.
According to the Tokyo Government, material losses amounted to $300,000 -- a blow that, despite the difficult world situation, seems to be going on.
After three loss-making quarters, data on gross domestic product from July to September have helped to turn the page upside down: GDP rose by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and by 6 per cent in the annual calculation.
In the second quarter, Japan ' s financial year begins in March 2012, it is also the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The rise may be partly due to the repurchasing of machinery for the restoration of areas that have been devastated by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1 per cent against a reduction of 0.9 per cent from January to March, the first reduction after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real divide in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Kenyan impulse, which calls for a crisis to be used to strengthen or restructure infrastructures, using lies to grow from zero.
Japan has woken up mainly because of household consumption, which now accounts for 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.
This rate increased by 1 per cent by increasing the cost of cars, travel and rest.
Paste One
Tokyo has provided the internal market when the Japanese currency has become one of the “currency currency” selected by investors who want to escape the debt crisis in the euro area and negative forecasts about the United States, a privilege that flows as a stone on behalf of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, production is expensive abroad, which is a serious blow to the country whose economic rate is determined by the health of large technological companies.
Toyota or Sonny, for example, blame the yen for their low performances from July to September.
While markets continue to be planted in the EU's peripheral countries, the Esihiko Noda Government does not reduce vigilance.
We must be aware of the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the sharp increase in its value, said Minister of Economic Policy Motohis Furukawa yesterday.
And indeed, prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most participating countries had demonstrated clear signs of a decline in economic activity in September.
The indicator that predicts the global economic collapse has shown that the main forces are slowing down.
He then dropped four tenths to 100.4 points compared with 100.8 in August.
Eurozone even dropped below the average of 100 points after it reached eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Aphines Give the Land for Doubt Again
Let us say that the adjustment will be approved, but the conservators will not sign any written obligation
With the periphery of risk and uncertainty in the parks, Greece continues to wander around the maze leading to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “agreement” of the new transitional government of Ellad is imposed on Brussels rather than on the true conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos warned yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundred-day period agreed upon at his appointment might be insufficient for their application, the leader of the Conservative Party of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support new measures of strict economy in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections appointed on 19 February.
The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October, Papadimos said yesterday, opening up parliamentary debates that are being won tomorrow ' s vote of confidence in the new executive authority.
A package of 24 programmes to increase employment, reform of the disciplinary code of public servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first introduction.
However, Samaras's message does not make clear any doubt about his position: "We are ready to help the Transitional Government, but we promise nothing."
One step has been taken by the leader of the Conservatives in his attitude towards the EU and IMF, organizations that are supposed to freeze 8,000 million urgently needed by Athens, and he has explained that he will not approve any letter of agreement with the treaty.
However, the European Commission, while still distraught by the effect of the Papandreou referendum's claims in its style or style, reiterated yesterday that its demands are clear: it will not resume aid if the new Government and leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign “a written agreement without any doubt and as soon as possible”.
The representative of the Ministry of Economics, Amadeu Altafay, said that the three inspectors could return to Athens “early” to discuss with the new Government “what should be done to pay the sixth tranche” of 8,000 million, although the exact date has not yet been marked.
In the Greek club, there will be enough nets for a while.
Ms. Sofia: "These are the instruments of progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's "basic" position on this type of finance
Spain has “occupied a prominent place in the world in microfinance”.
The Queen of Sofia recalled yesterday that in the last two decades, the country has become a second-large donor in terms of cooperation instruments, whose “ essence”, she said, is that it is “a tool of social progress, justice and hope for the best future of all humanity based on faith in humans”.
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valyadolid with the conviction that “there is no doubt” that such actions are “perfectly necessary” to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015, and that “with a particular aim of reducing the number of people living below one dollar per day, the level at which the poverty line is recorded”.
Spain is “still working” to expand the network of beneficiaries around the world and assume this task with full “responsibility”, says Done Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements of the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will “provide new capacities and opportunities for the poorest people and especially for women, the “main recipients of these loans”.
There are "many achievements" and "many difficulties we face."
The Microcredit Summit is not only a platform for disputes but also a platform that contributes to “two main objectives”.
Her Majesty thus explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services and hundreds of millions of households would be excluded from the poverty in which they were loaded.
The impetus for the establishment of a microcredit system in Spain and throughout the rest of the world “was on the way started years ago” by Mohammed Yunus, stressed Ms. Sofia as “an act of justice and recognition”.
And she described the father of this instrument as a "defeating idealist in the universal fight against poverty", whose work has been known for 15 years, since the Queen went to Bangladesh to study his credit policy on site.
This year, the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “I have seen an ongoing development everywhere”, said Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought her yesterday the title “the head of the family”, gathered in Valyadolide as “the banker of the poor”.
Finally, the Queen of Sofia concluded her speech by calling on those present to participate in the discussion and finding solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Foreign Minister Trinidad Hymenez said that solidarity was an “ethical imperative” for every democratic State.
In this regard, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries with the economic boom times, since it was a “permanent commitment”.
Hymenes concluded that microcredit is a “serious and solid course for the eradication of poverty”, and now “greater than ever” the Governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to be a victim of cost reduction.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of development cooperation”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, praised the “success” for giving “confidence” to people who are “closed to whom all the doors are closed”, and Mayor Valyadolid Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva welcomed all those present in the city who “opens their doors with a spirit of solidarity”.
HDS proposes to elect the President of the European Commission by a general vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (HDS) on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, passed without any major problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who also chaired the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but it was only in the autumn, in particular, to satisfy activists who felt that government policies were not as strict as they should be with Greece today and perhaps with Italy tomorrow....
The draft resolution on the presidency of the European Commission, which was submitted to the Governing Body for discussion, was almost unanimously adopted.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The ovations, which continued for several minutes, earned by Angela Merkel's statements and several hours later Wolfgang Shoible, the Eurofil and the Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The principal idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is the slogan: the correct response to the crisis is "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not just because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro”.
For the chancellor, the time has come for a break-in in Europe.
This may mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty, which will make it possible to strengthen the European Union's control of the euro area's financial policies, but this may also affect the election of the President of the European Commission with a general vote, “to give a person to Europe”.
In any case, it is one of the proposals for a draft resolution adopted by the Congress, which obviously belongs to Wolfgang Shoible.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will agree quickly with this decision; Britain is against it, and HDS leaders believe that Nikola Sarkozy is against it too.
But the soil is ready.
Similarly, delegates by the overwhelming majority rejected the proposal to weigh the votes of each member of the Euro-Union in the European Central Bank in accordance with the size of each economy, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
The Chancellor has increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kolya, but she has not sought to influence the congress through "small" European countries or countries in a difficult situation that like to criticise "high commercial" Germany.
Although the whole paragraph of the draft resolution on Europe refers to the importance of “the German-French friendship”, Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Just by the way.
Remembering that two centuries ago, Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonian army.
What's a fake with the hospital letters?
Following cash benefits, UMP and the Government began to enter hospitals.
On 15 November, Nikola Sarkozy will come to Bordo to visit the Family Benefit Distribution Fund and to address this issue, which has been rising periodically since 2007, on combating social benefits fraud.
And in order to help this incident, which arose from the desire to save in a difficult situation, but also as part of the campaign of the right to re-election in the Presidents, most would like to focus on hospital records.
First of all, in view of the budget economy, the Government intends to impose on private companies the fourth day of unpaid leave before the start of the payment of the benefit.
Clearly, without the employer ' s special consent, the employee loses four days ' pay equal to at least 15 per cent of his/her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to cause a storm of anger but which, according to Les Echos, will save 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely to impose on public servants one day without the payment of sickness benefits (the public servants had not yet expected to pay benefits, unlike the three-day expectation for private sector workers).
Now that these issues have been discussed, most of them also raise the subject of fraud, with regard to abuse in issuing hospital letters.
Control will become more intense and additional, if you are caught, you will have to return all the illegal payments you have received," Xawya Bertran warned on Saturday 13 November at the RTL channel.
As in other cases, the effect of the statement has been somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of hospital records.
They have indeed been under constant control and political attacks since 2002.
People in France suffer no more than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's look at the numbers in the country first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros were paid daily in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation of the Health Economy, the daily compensation costs in 2008 amounted to €11.3 billion, 5% of the total health costs.
Of this, 46 per cent were reported as a result of the decree and accidents of production and 54 per cent of sickness benefits, which amounted to €6.2 billion.
As a result, 2.5 per cent of health expenditures were incurred.
The French were hospitalized for an average of 14.5 days in 2010 compared with 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting Group.
The average arithmetic that conceals some deviations; another study published in 2007 by Monster.com's Career Management website showed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 French workers interviewed said they did not take one day of the hospital.
Another study on health insurance claims that 37 per cent of patients were less than 8 days in 2010, 15 per cent of 15 days a month, 15 per cent of one to three months, and 11 per cent longer in 2010.
When comparing these figures with the figures of the European neighbours, it is evident that French workers are no longer inclined to take a hospital than those of any other country.
The long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall proportion of absence of work in France (for health reasons or not) fluctuated between 10 per cent and 11 per cent, compared with 20-28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16-18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The level of fraud associated with hospital records is very low compared to “serious” employment.
As for the level of fraud, it's very low.
Intensification of the law since 2002 has resulted in a systematic check of the length of the hospital for more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million cases reviewed by CNAM, 13 per cent of 285,000 short-term findings were “unjustified” or too long”, which is 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked hospital records over 45 days 11 per cent of 1.2 million cases were “inappropriate or unwarranted” and 132,000.
In general, 169,000 cases were “unwarranted” for several million workers who received hospital letters.
The numbers that show very few cases compared, for example, to the numbers of "serious" jobs.
According to UMP MEP Dominika Tiana, the author of the report on this issue in June, they amounted to between €9 million and €15 million of unearned budget revenue per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore is infinitely higher than the loss of fraud.
Falloff: Greece should follow the new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement programme to save its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos told Parliament that 100 days given to his coalition Government were insufficient to carry out this task.
"In order to achieve the goals of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and the new programme of budget adjustment," said the head of Government, who made his first public statement, opening a debate on this confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October should be the “main task” of the new Government, since the country’s presence in Eurozone is “put on the map” - he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos predicts a decrease in the country's budget deficit of approximately 9 per cent from GDP by the end of the year, with 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
Lawmakers reject new Government
On Monday, right-wing leader Antonis Samaras expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional measures of austerity.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with deputies from his party of New Democracy.
He agreed with the challenges of reducing deficits and debt and combating distortions, but also his refusal to accept any course that impedes economic recovery.
Ollie Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economics and Finance, who warned that IMF and the EU were not blocking the necessary loan of €8,000 million without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
The need to legalize euthanasia and suicide with foreign aid is stated by the Committee of Experts
Canadians refuse to die, approved in the report of the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative medicine, the Committee argues that the Government, health institutions and doctors work together to ensure the best palliative care, without considering cancer.
Canadians refuse to die.
Only 9 per cent of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in this direction.
This is one of the conclusions of the impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the criminal code in a manner that allows suicide by means of foreign aid and euthanasia when this choice is imposed on circumstances and the patient can be considered competent to take such a decision.
To begin with, the experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada is at 10 locations, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death”.
Because of medicalization or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative assistance, experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada report.
And 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
The highest rate per country in Quebec, where 86 per cent of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and suicide, the authors of the report conclude that it is contrary to the position of the federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code on euthanasia and suicide by foreign aid.
Now, according to experts who have also examined the position of all countries where such acts have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that such decriminalization involves abuse, i.e. the execution of euthanization or suicide by means of foreign aid to persons who cannot or do not wish to take such a decision.
On the contrary, he confirmed during the Jocelin Downi teleconference, which presented the report, most of these cases were in countries where euthanasia and suicide with foreign aid were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is obviously illegal.
Suicide with foreign aid is practiced in Canada, where it is obviously illegal, explains Joselin Downi.
Canadian euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85 per cent of Canadians are in favour of euthanization because, according to Angus Reida's 2010 survey, they believe that this will enable people to alleviate their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66 per cent believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not be a sign that the life of older persons or persons with disabilities is of less value.
With regard to people who assisted in suicide, 41 per cent of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care for the sick, the situation is less clear, the authors say.
They also propose, in addition to their other recommendations, that the criminal code should establish that legal cessation of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires health professionals to teach in a spirit of respect for the refusal of medical care at the end of their life without fear of criminal prosecution.
With regard to palliative assistance, the Committee calls on the Government, health care and medical institutions to work together to develop the best possible palliative assistance, not only in cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to the palliative or terminal session already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve as a source of physical pain, such as euthanization, and is subject to the same limitations.
Comments of other experts
Some health law experts have already commented on the conclusion of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Metr Pierre Deshan, a health law specialist, described the “terminal” position of experts who signed the report, because, among other things, it does not restrict the use of euthanization in fatal cases.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years of age can ask for help in committing suicide, says Met. Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Metro Descham also stressed that the authors of the report appear to be independent of the personality above all other values that constitute the social fabric of society.
He said, "There are warning signs and bans in society."
Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expresses “a categorical disagreement with the conclusions of the report, which she referred to as “a euthanasia manifesto”.
Margaret Somerville, who herself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes, inter alia, the report on abuses in some countries where euthanasia and suicide with foreign aid are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Asada to give power
Damascus condemns "the conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar Assad's partners demonstrated yesterday before the Foreign Ministry building.
Yesterday, the diplomatic pressure on Syria was intensified by Bashar Assad, who, with the support of Russia, opposes it and condemns “the conspiracy” against his country.
Two days after the withdrawal of Syria from the League of Arab States, the European Union stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, and the Syrian neighbours Turkey and Jordan resigned President Assad.
The king of Jordan Abdullah II became the first Arab leader yesterday, who summoned President Bashar Asada to take power in Syria, where about forty civilians and members of the armed forces were killed.
"If Bashar had the ways of his country's interests, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighboring country with Syria, in an interview with BBC.
In turn, Turkey ' s Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu expressed regret that Turkey ' s mediation efforts, which started early this year, had not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their aspirations lose power, he said, urging Syria, the neighbouring country in which Turkey is taking a more stringent course.
For their part, the United States welcomes the “enlargement of consensus against Assad and the action of the Syrian regime”, followed by the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and such countries as Turkey are taking an ever-increasing rate of repression in Syria, Mark Toner, a representative of the State Department, noted.
At this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 representatives of the armed forces have died in the Dera region of southern Syria, reports the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other residents were killed during the shooting and shooting of heavy rifles in Jobara in the busy town of Homs, according to the NGO.
At the Syrian Foreign Minister’s press conference, Valid Muallem said that the country was approaching the end of the crisis.”
He also reacted strongly to the decision of the League of Arab States to exclude Damascus, which he said was a “dangerous step”.
The Syrian will not be broken, and he added, "This conspiracy against Syria will fail."
Following his decision to exclude Syria from the League of Arab States, he was currently studying “the civil protection mechanism and required the recruitment of 500 members of the Arab Human Rights Organization, journalists and military observers into the country.
French Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Zuppe also expressed support for the sending of observers from the United Nations to help protect civilians from repression of the regime, which he said fell into “paranoia”.
The new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow at Rabata to discuss the implementation of the exit plan adopted on 2 November, which includes, inter alia, the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in which they are fighting and the release of the arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov referred to yesterday as an “inaccurate” decision of the League of Arab States, while China called on Syria to implement a plan to get out of the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty requires time for Italian markets and victims
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for some time to set up their team and implement a programme that would require “victims” to restore the credit lost in the last few months of the rule of Berlin.
The former European Commissioner yesterday participated in discussions with political parties before today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
It will have to form a relatively moderate office consisting of non-parliamentary technicians.
Monty spoke about the importance of a programme involving many victims, said Francesco Nucara, a representative of a number of small parliamentary groups who took part in discussions after meeting with the candidate for the Prime Minister's post.
Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Janfranco Fini, said he would wait to see if Mario Monti would ask Parliament to vote in confidence by Friday to ensure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The meeting will conclude with Mr. Monty ' s presentation of a limited list of dozens or about that of ministers of the country, George Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on yesterday ' s nervousness of the stock exchanges and bond holders, requesting time.
When “democracy takes time to prepare the Government and the programme, he stressed that he was convinced that markets would be patient and understanding”.
His appointment as President was initially approved by the markets, but concern arose again, particularly after the unexpected fall of industrial production in Eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should have formed a team, including, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include “politicians”.
The new Government will have to act by 2013, the dates of the next elections, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Janfranco Fini, the new Government will receive a vote of confidence in Parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monty assured him that when he entered the post, he would work hard to ensure that Italy would once again become an important active person in Europe.
The representative of European Commissioner Ollie Rehn stressed that “in spite of the new Government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed”.
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not implement the 2013 budget, in spite of the strict economic plan adopted in recent months, called for, inter alia, new stringent measures.
The Italian boss Emma Marchegali, who will meet him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, “because the country that is not growing cannot meet the deficits.”
Mr. Monty, known for his competence and independence in the home of the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represented an “epoch shift” for Italy after 17 years of “berlusconism”, “professor”, symbolizing “serious challenges” and “other Italy”, according to the authors.
The great unknown is the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid the early elections, as by April 2012, Italy had to make public debt payments of €20,000.
Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear programme
Russian scientist Vácheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, confirmed on Monday the American Atomic Hazards Agency.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of this UN agency to establish the identity of this scientist.
Last week, IAEA expressed concern about the "possible military aspect" of the Iranian nuclear programme
According to ISIS, which was largely based on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934 and worked for 30 years, “from the 1960s, at the Soviet Nuclear Center in Chelabinska (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds of explosive methods”.
In 1989 or 1991, he left the center to create a company producing nanoalmase in Kiev.
His company ' s financial difficulties brought him into contact with the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 until his return to Russia
In its IAEA report, it mentions “clear signs that Iran has developed the nuclear detonator system “a foreign expert who not only knew this technique well but also informed the Agency that he was working most of his career on this technology as part of his country’s military nuclear programme”.
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50 per cent
According to FBI statistics published on Monday from 2009 to 2010, the number of anti-Muslim crimes has increased by almost 50 per cent, while other forms of violence on racial and religious grounds have slightly decreased or remained unchanged during the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which is equivalent to 49 per cent, compared to the increase in 13 per cent of cases of Catholic violence, the decrease in 4 per cent of Jews attacks and the increase in the total number of crimes on a religious basis.
The total number of hate crimes reported by the FBI increased very little to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3 per cent were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
After the decline in 2009, there is concern that the number of these crimes is increasing again, the Human Rights First Human Rights Organization, “the increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant”, adds the organization in an official communication.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be seen as serious human rights violations," added one of the leaders of Paul Legandr.
“The American Government can and should do more to deal with these crimes,” he added, assuming that this could be done by improving police reports of hate crimes.”
“Hateful acts” in federal law are the legacy of the period of civil rights struggle.
This law was passed after Martin Luther King's death to punish acts of violence related to race, colour, religion, nationality and sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes Facebook-like
On Monday, the website of the microblog Twitter has changed its platform, which will allow users, in particular, to see the activities of those they are following what this service is doing on Facebook.
The new "activity" and "name" tab allow you to monitor more easily and directly the activities of other "twitters", the Internet users whose messages ("twitters") you are tracking, and those who follow yours.
This gives an opportunity to learn if they publish messages, if they sign new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was protested "by a small percentage of users in August" before going out on a wide-ranging basis on Monday, AFP told the Twitter press secretary Caroline Penner.
Twitter, which for a long time has been known as intuitively rather vague and using rather vague terms (RT for someone else's communication, #followfriday for the recommendation to track other users), is mostly gratifying to experienced users, thus opening up to a wider audience, representing users something closer to popular social networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users discussed this innovation using "twitters" on the Internet.
"It's useless, it's exhausting, and it's like Facebook."
Functional activity will help me better monitor certain elements of my stream on Twitter, wrote @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction to the Golden Rule Constitution
The leader of the Great Coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, who is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to write down the budget “golden rule” in the Constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid possible reductions in the public credit rating of Austria (triple A).
The Chancellor of Social Democrats Werner Faymann personally announced this decision at the end of the Council of Ministers meeting, while the Austrian State debt was 74.6 per cent, which was significantly higher than the upper threshold of the 60 per cent rate established by the Maastricht Treaty but below the State debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's capacity to pay had dropped by just one point, from AAA to AAA+, we would have to pay per cent per thousand euros more each year, according to the Deputy Chancellor and Foreign Minister of Christian Democrats Michael Spinderlegger.
Thus, Austria fulfils the requirement of the Eurozone Summit on 26 October in Brussels; Heads of State and Government required a reduction in budgetary deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through a constitution or equal law.
The decision adopted by the Austrian Government recalls the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt this "rule".
By 2017, the structural deficit of the State budget should be reduced annually by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, since 2017, the structural deficit of the State's federal budget should not exceed 0.35% of GDP in any year and the land, as well as municipalities, should represent balanced budgets.
The aim is to make public debt lower than 60 per cent of the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Esihiko Noda
threatens a new exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Esihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would make new interventions on the foreign market if their value continued to grow.
We interfere with how we did this last time, if we consider the excessive volatility of the exchange rate of yena, Mr. Noda Senate explained.
On Tuesday, the yen grew almost until the historic note that prompted Japan ' s authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold a large dollar yen to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which has established a new power record since 1945.
But since then, the wave has grown steadily, driven by the purchases of investors who view it as a "refugee" in these sad times of economic downturn around the world and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar dropped below 77 yen and the euro dropped below the symbolic plank in 105 yen, close to the level that led to the last intervention.
Prior to the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro was over 160 yen.
The increase in Japanese currency is damaging Japanese exports because it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces Japanese firms ' income because of foreign exchange conversion.
“Japan is fighting to restore itself” after the earthquake and tsunamis on 11 March, which devastated the Tohok region (north-east), stressed Mr. Noda, who feared that this growth would kill the fragile generation of reconstruction.
The third world-wide economic Power resumed growth in the third quarter -1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, due to the increase in exports and consumption of disaster-affected households
But the Prime Minister feels that its high price does not reflect Japan's “fundamental economic indicators”.
Minister of Finance June Adzumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened the two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Board on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the debt.
But the Deputy Governor of Hirohid Yamaguti warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “the appropriate steps” to understand that no further mitigation in the environment should be expected.
At the last meeting, at the end of October, the issuing organization increased the purchase of depositary bonds by 5,000 million yen (47,000 euros) by up to 55,000 thousand yen (519 thousand euros) of the sums it allocates to purchase various financial instruments to fill the securities market.
Eurozone
Rates grow, stock exchanges fluctuate
The risk of a debt crisis is undermined by European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of State in Greece and Italy and the improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in unstable countries continue to grow
The eurozone is still concerned about stability, and the European Stock Exchanges went on Tuesday, 15 November, a little further into the negative zone.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and ended trades at 3,064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4% and London by 0.1%.
With regard to the new difficulties in the payment of credit by countries in the euro area in difficulty, the global stock markets continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
"The concerned investors are just too concerned about the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a fall of 0.7 per cent under the burden of new market doubts with a view to Europe ' s ability to hold back the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has pursued its view of Europe, and the stock exchange will follow each other in the corridor of close changes until investors have confirmed that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsusige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management
This is a return of concern about the future eurozone, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
Euro reached its lowest mark in half a month.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was $1.3570, falling by 0.4 per cent.
According to the brokers, it fell after the arrival of Chancellor Angela Merkel HDS on Monday, in which a resolution was adopted which included, inter alia, the possibility for a country in a difficult situation to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates significantly above 6 per cent
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a high level of concern.
This morning, on Tuesday, the income of Italian 10-year-old bonds reached 6.85 per cent and the income of Spanish bonds reached 6.2 per cent with the same maturity.
These differences in interest rates in southern countries, but also in France, continue to raise the concerns of participants.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, asked the exchange of time to restore the situation in Italy under the threat of paralysis under its debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Papadimos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be “the main task” of his Government.
Spain was under attack before the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
A new historical ceiling has been reached between the interest rates on Germany and Spain ' s 10-year debt obligations.
Waiting for growth in Eurozone
France recorded economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than expected by 0.3 per cent, due to increased household consumption.
Insee, however, revised to reduce the number of the second quarter, with a fall of 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded growth of 0.5 per cent over the same period.
The first assessment for the euro area is expected at 11 a.m., and the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is a subject on which a decision cannot be taken after a continuous discussion or under the influence of emotions, it is an energy policy.
The availability and value of electricity directly affects the purchasing capacity and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that elections are a reason for thinking about the share and location of nuclear energy.
The dispute will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options are examined.
France should build its opinion on objective facts and on sound data.
We now have 7,000 million people on the planet, and demographic development will double the need for electricity by 2050, unless the vast majority of the world ' s population is deprived of vitally important elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to meet the growing shortage of mined resources to continue the production of electricity on a continuous basis, without forgetting the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate imbalance, a theme that has disappeared from environmental debates.
The Fukushima crash does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains single in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which makes its decision depending on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil are just a few of those who are determined to continue their projects.
The United States decided, after Fukushima, to add one plant to its package by re-establishing the station that was interrupted after an accident in Tri-Mail Island.
Although the model of Germany, based on renewable energy, is sometimes used as an example, the reality is contrary to that argument.
The selection of Berlin will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, increased energy dependence, increased by the growing need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, for carbon dioxide emissions from gas and coal stations.
A few months later, all these adverse effects will be felt.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
The European Turbine Construction Championship, from which it receives 30% of its electricity, is also the largest carbon and gas user due to a break-in wind, resulting in emissions of carbon dioxide and electricity prices of 65% and 50% higher than on average across Europe.
On the other hand, because of the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
As the globalised energy price economy is a key factor in competitiveness and the supply of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will lead to a significant increase in the cost of electricity, which will make illustrative beautiful statements about our country ' s new industrialization and the protection of purchasing power.
The price that most French people refuse to pay is more because they do not object to this kind of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country ' s energy policy has made it possible to create the industry in 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 people in the middle.
Strong export-oriented, it attracts the full pleasure of international trade in small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another sector.
If France had decided to give up nuclear power, it would have to contribute a large amount of these enterprises and lose €6,000 a year from French nuclear equipment and services exports.
What electric engineer will be ordered by the EPR, calculated to work for sixty years, if the closure of its manufacturer is planned?
To solve the energy equation, it should be acknowledged that there are no divine or demonic sources of energy production.
The development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions by Areva demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest level of security for nuclear energy is no doubt a vital issue
In France, we have a security body that has uncompromising and transparent control over existing energy centres, such as Flemishville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is generally recognized, are filled with the same capacity for security.
For 50 years, the nuclear industry has survived three major incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mail Island, has occurred under normal conditions of operation, but without any human or environmental impact
In Chernobyl, the reactor device and the unforgivable human error have led to tragedy.
In Fukushima some people seem to forget that the accident occurred as a result of two natural disasters of unprecedented force that resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn lessons from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
The result of this step and the cooperation between the security authorities, the operators and the French and German designers, EPR, is a project to counter such phenomena.
Since it is considered by all energy specialists who want to build a reactor, the stoppage of its construction in Flamanville will be a great gift to the Areva and EDF competitors by clearing their way to winning leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear energy.
It is necessary and lawful to seek the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and prejudices to prevail in a dispute that is so important to our country ' s economic, social and financial situation.
Immigration is a burden or good for the economy?
Immigrant policies with Nicola Sarkozy have been criticized by various parties - the overloading of police, judicial and administrative services subject to digital policy and the compatibility of this policy with France's self-declared status as "human rights".
Then there was an administrative concern of foreign students, which came to a news release when the Minister of the Interior (Liberason of 23 May) said that France “does not need foreign talents, stones and officers”.
But it is very rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The right and the left in this matter are very much in agreement.
On the right-hand side, Jacques Shirac, who in 1976 stated that “900,000 unemployed people will not become a problem in the country with 2 million foreign workers”, and on the left, Michel Rocar, who explained in 1990 that France “cannot accept the poor from around the world”.
Difference in generosity only
In 2005, fear of invasion into the country was felt both by the Polish watertight and by the right.
Both sides see the burden of immigration for the French economy and for the French society.
There is only a difference in the level of generosity that they will be able to show to immigrants.
In his programme, François Holland was limited to banality, he said that “co-operation would solve our immigration problem”.
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem can give an electoral advantage, but it is very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in the recent book, which summarizes the latest immigration data (Special People: How migration has formed our world and will determine our future, May 2011, Princeton University edition, 352 c.), there is a broad consensus among professionals on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
The restriction of immigration has led to a decrease in growth and employment.
Fears of immigrants ' influence are based on the assumption that they are able to replace local workers, especially low-skilled, with lower wages.
However, experience has shown that in reality immigrants are far more complementary than they are replacing local labour by doing work that is not sufficient for the local labour force.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not have local labour force, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training is not related to job proposals.
Positive impact on salaries
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity between local and immigrants leads to a positive impact on local workers ' wages.
Giovanni Perry estimated that the increase in migration flows by 1 per cent resulted in an increase of 0.6-0.9 per cent of real long-term wages.
And this is not to be taken into account that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (a large proportion of natural immigrants were among the Nobel Prize winners, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants).
Migrants also make a net profit in social security systems, with an average of 1 per cent of the total budgets of European countries.
According to the World Labour Organization, for example, when an immigrant arrived in Germany at the age of 30, he would make a net profit (loss of income) to the public budget of an average of 150,000 euros.
Nikola Sarkozy, at the beginning of his term of office, was to gather teeth into missing growth points.
These teeth, which were used to frighten immigrants, had an equally opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, European democracy remains to be understood
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; but at the same time it is fragile.
The European continent must remember that, when it was invented in Athens over 2,000 years ago, in the 20th century, it had survived the tragedy of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulag, and Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Colonels in Greece.
Some felt that democracy would finally be adamant of its enemies, that it would be enough to put a vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since Napoleon's time, Little knows what's happening from the surface of the thought.
The general vote, although a mandatory condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can even become “a tool of oppression”, as Etienne Yourro once said.
No, democracy also requires a lot of other public space, public spirit, values, organization, division and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but first of all it is a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the Palinodia of a true and false Greek referendum will have a double revealing effect, demonstrating both the need for serious policy change and the unpleasant feeling of its inability and inconsistency.
This duality needs to be understood to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the fight for democracy has now moved and, in the opinion of many, the Republican soldiers are now not on that side.
We do not win anything by requiring a series of national referendums organized as appropriate and in a chaotic manner.
"Cart Blanch" for an absolute European monarch or nailed to the leg in the fall of nationalism -- what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not dream of the guillotine lesion, but of the implementation - a joint, clear and continuous - of choice and democracy at this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal, and there is no knowledge of how much more they will have to be listed, because there is only one crisis - a crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is fully subject to market and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is completely humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but Europe as a whole gradually loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The management of the European project under national sovereignty needs to be restored urgently.
Because only by working together will Europeans be able to reduce the debt burden of each person, get rid of the markets and prepare for the future by investing in them.
The outcome of the crisis will require decisions at the European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, without bringing us to disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delore, all are now required by the European Economic Government.
Let it go.
But to represent itself without stronger economic, political and democratic integration, which is in the hands of citizens, is a regular madness and a new stupidity.
We must start a new phase of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, it was necessary to create Republicans.
The revolution of interests would not be enough.
This lesson is still in force.
We must build Europe, one at the economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, the people of Europe.
To create Europe, let's create Europeans.
Uncontacted chip cards are being distributed more and more.
The World Chip Map exhibition opens on Tuesday in Wilpente under Paris in the atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 2011 will result in 11 per cent increase in world microprocessor sales (bank cards, SIM telephones), exceeding, according to Eurosmart, 6,000 million units.
The most important non-contact technology sector that enables public transport or purchase to be paid simply by conducting a map over the receiving device.
This year, 460 million non-contact chips will be sold worldwide against 320 million years ago!
Their share will be 580 million units in 2012 and will account for almost 10% of the world market for chips (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long been lagging behind from the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in the field of non-contact payments.
About 26 million Visa bank cards have already been provided with this function and receive 75,000 terminals.
France is starting with more modest positions: 400,000 visa-free cards are in circulation.
But big stores are growing faster.
This year Carrefour released 2.5 million uncontacted Pass MasterCard.
To get to a higher speed, banks must supply their customers with equipment.
"Two major organizations in France have promised to systematically distribute bank cards that are suitable for offline use to their clients in the future," said Žerar Nebui, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing payments using mobile phones.
But this is only the first stage of the development of the future means of payment, that is the mobile phone.
Only a small number of devices are equipped with NFC technology (close field communication) necessary for such transactions.
"They were postponed.
"But they must actually fly next year."
"We count on world sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012," explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced the experiment from December to June next year in Cana.
The iPhone equipment will provide approximately 200 clients and staff with check-ups that provide wireless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale also said yesterday that it was preparing to launch a bid market that would allow its customers to pay through mobile phones.
The terrorist front extends from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long anticipated links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram were confirmed.
On Friday, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that the Algerians were now convinced of this.
“The nature of these two organizations and the reports of the secret services show that they are actively cooperating,” he explained without giving in detail.
Paris seems to have come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation of the abduction of two Frenchmen in Nigeria in January revealed two linkages.
The people abducted at the restaurant in Niamey, near Aqmi, Antoine de Leokur and Vensan Delori were apparently killed the following day, along with several of the kidnappers during the operation carried out by the French special units.
Among the loopholes left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several telephone sem-cards belonging to terrorists.
Here's the terror.
A number of interviewees in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria have been identified by the analysis of the field.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one points to a Nigerian who lived long in Majdigura, a city in northern Nigeria, the Boko Haram shackles, and the other points to a person as claimed to be close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This step forward, but there is no doubt more reliable evidence to be expected before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But that's possible."
“It has been known for many years that the sect has received financial and ideal support outside and that it is becoming more and more active,” says Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident through the actions and statements of Boko Haram and its methods, which now include the use of lethals and increasingly complex explosive devices of the same type as Aqmi.
The international community in head of Washington is now putting pressure on Abuja to focus on the problems that Boko Haram is creating.
The case is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally treated this group as a community of educated people who are not interested.
Quick success
Founded in Maydigura in 2002, at a mosque, school and with a fundamentalist Mohammed Yusufe, Boko Haram -- which means “Western education is a sin” -- preaches the establishment of a Muslim emirat in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has achieved rapid success.
It has been politicized and requires strict compliance with the Sharia, and its activists have begun to fight against the evil central government.
It is mainly aimed at churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, activists in Boko Haram demonstrated special activity by carrying out numerous attacks on police offices.
Abuji's reaction is usually uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Joseph, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalizing and going beyond its northern tissues.
Last Christmas she took responsibility for the action that killed 80 people in Jose and then another one in Abuja.
In June, Abuja Boko Haram organized the first attack by the killer on the police headquarters.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will become their first international goal.
The establishment of a terrorist axis in Africa, coming from Mauritania through Nigeria in Somalia, now concerns all security experts.
Today, when Aqmi was strengthened in Mali and Nigeria and the Somalis from al-Shabaab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a discussion with Presidents Gudlak Jonathan Allen Zuppe warned of the danger of Boko Haram and expressed his willingness to share all the information available.
World as the Republicans see it in the Presidents
With regard to China, Iran and Israel's assistance to Mitt Romney, Herman Kane and Rick Perry, they are confronted with simplification and incompetence.
Can America's weakened crisis bring about a complex world through simple, more precise ideas?
If candidates were to be heard by the presidents of the Republicans, voters could believe that.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying huge but lacking details of the foreign policy statement, which are traditionally a strong side of the Republic.
The slogans relating to China, Iran and assistance to Israel are often mixed up with one another.
Mitt Romni, who had the best chance of moving from the Old Good Party, threatened to complain to the Chinese at the WTO and accuse them of “manipulating their currency” is a sensitive topic for America, which is upset by the migration of its entire industry in Asia.
Worse still, if it would lead to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Ambassador Obama of China, and the only candidate who understood a complex foreign policy, was unable to combat the position that is emotionally inflamed.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (now Obama).
But Huntsman, who holds in the lower part of the ratings, remained unheard of.
Reagan-style
Romania also pledged military attacks on Iran if sanctions could not stop its nuclear programme.
"If they choose me, I will stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to strengthen Israel ' s military assistance, accusing Obama of not fulfilling his commitments to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Kane, the second candidate, demonstrated a depressing ignorance.
He recently called for a Chinese military threat because Beijing has been trying to achieve nuclear power, obviously not knowing that China has had it since 1964!
Governor Texas Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military strikes on Iran, says he is ready to use the American army in Mexico against drug addicts.
resorting to the torture of suspected terrorism prohibited by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and Michel Bachman.
All of this is very far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McKain, who has a heavy external policy.
The opponents of the current president say that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was a lover and that he had to reduce the tone of combating terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the premature conclusion of the Iraq ' s "breeds", his captures in Libya, which had given him the reputation of a weak policy.
But it's not that simple.
The population considered the positive balance of national security with Obama, which had abolished Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military intervention that binds the sand.
And, claiming that America needs to be transformed economically to restore its leadership, Obama rights.
The North Stream, new doors for the entry of Russian gas into Europe.
Gas pipeline North Stream connecting Western Europe and Russia directly at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
It is estimated to be equivalent to 30 million households.
Gasprom, a Russian giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate this event with a pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, participated last Tuesday on the Baltic coasts, between the orchestra and the sought-after breakfasts, in the opening of the North Stream, a new pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly under water.
The Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francis Fion and his Dutch counterpart Mart Rutte have together returned a symbolic valve to control Russian gas coming into the Western European network.
The new pipeline of 27.5 million additional cubic metres of gas will reach Western Europe every year at the first pipeline of 1,224 km, connecting the Leningrad region from the Mecklenburg-Pomerania countries.
The second pipeline should be ready at the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 cubic metres of gas equivalent to all of France's consumption.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already being discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project encountered severe opposition from Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power: they will be more difficult to influence Russia, threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of the debate, Warsaw did not stop before comparing the North Stream with the new German-Soviet Pact, aimed at an alliance between Hitler and Stalin with a view to occupying Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of supply.
But it is worth noting Europe's lack of energy because the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europe.
Russia has been able to achieve its understanding of the direct union between Russia and the rich Western countries that consume large amounts of gas and whose own stocks are already on the rise in time.
"This pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, it's a new artery that organically binds us," said François Fion, opening the pipeline, demonstrating how important both political and economic gas contracts are.
All of this explains the broad smiles on the heads of Gazprom, who were present in large numbers in Ljumina, the point of arrival of the gas.
Building this pipeline is also a technical milestone.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel trapped in concrete to protect it from ship anchors.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
In order to build it, the remaining mines of the Second World War had to be circled.
"The hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Muller, a North Stream press secretary.
There was also a need to take many steps to protect the fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake with an equal weight of 242 Eiffel Towers, with no breakings all over its length, no valves and no service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers refused it, because Sweden was not aware that the Russian State company would settle on its banks forever.
"In the event of an accident, we will cross the gas stream less than a minute," says Jens Muller.
So if the gas in the gas pipeline is leaked, it'll go into air.
But it seems that these are unlikely designers who designed wires, calculated only once in 100,000 years.
The control of the mode of the pipeline will be carried out by a submarine that pulls the ship out for external observation as well as by the equipment circulating within the pipeline.
The smoker shall be introduced within a 1-metre tube tube and placed in front of the gas flow.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at a speed of 3 metres per second, it provides accurate information on any deformation of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed for work for 50 years without the need for minor repairs.
Gas circulation is only carried out by pressure.
It consists of 200 bars on departure and 100 bars on arrival.
Five companies have merged efforts to implement the project.
The leader is Gazprom, which has 51 per cent of the capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), the Netherlands Gasunie and the French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture called the North Stream, which was commissioned to build and operate a gas pipeline.
Its headquarters is located in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased this company for twenty years with the possibility of extending the total amount of gas transport.
"Gazprom will pay for the full amount, no matter how much gas is actually transported," says Jens Muller.
Gas pipeline financing was provided by 30% of shareholders and by 70% of bank loans.
The total value of the work will be 7.4 billion euros per two pipelines.
GDF Suez will invest about 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will raise their costs because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The gas pipeline comes from the Baltic Sea in Ljubmin on a sandy beach planted by pine trees.
The valves are 4.5 meters high and form the exhaust terminal.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before turning it into German gas pipelines.
Last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
It will be 3 million hours in full power and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine Brand Block
Moleskine, created by the Italian company 15 years ago, will taste the letter.
It has the aroma of adventures, the hours of the letter in the light of the light.
The Moleskine block is easy to find on the direct black cover, on the edge, on the yellow-white pages, as if it were on time.
However, Moleskine's book, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, located in Milan, decided to sell design blocks.
Maria Sebregondi, then company consultant, took responsibility for launching a new product.
The block is inspired by an old production technique, a mollusk - lacquered paper fabric, which was used, for example, to cover the sketches.
It is claimed that this type of blocknote is highly appreciated by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has brought into line with today's taste the old and forgotten thing that was culturally for avant-garde artists until the 20th century," said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the managing brand in Mode Modo.
Good luck.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales grew by 25 per cent and reached 12.7 million.
We were far away from production for the first few years when there were only 3,000 blocknotes.
Moleskine crossed Italy ' s borders and was exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
The profile of the typical buyer is difficult because the block is equally attractive to businessmen, students and people of a free profession.
The customers of Moleskine are cosmopolitan, have broad views and are educated.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It spread its blocks in Fnac bookshops, shops in small towns and was able to acquire extensive knowledge.
"We have followed the spirit of time and this new need in writing, despite the emergence of e-mail," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This characteristic cultural feature is accompanied by the development of Moleskine; the brand recently organized the “Environment Road” exhibition, where architects and artists demonstrated their own blocks.
In August, he also launched a Leopard drawing of the Locarno film festival.
Using its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products, which now include pockets, gloves, computer bags. Brand includes all kinds of support.
The success that gave rise to dependence: In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which has entered a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is unemployment among disabled workers so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of employment of persons with disabilities begins today.
Despite the public welfare policy launched in 2005, the unemployment rate among persons with disabilities still remains twice as high as the average, which is 19 per cent versus 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
It's curing?
“No,” said Eric Blanche, Director General Adapt, who organized a week of employment for persons with disabilities.
"A lot of progress has been made in 15 years."
"At the time, the unemployment rate wasn't two, but three times more."
"There's still a lot of work going on."
It has to be said that there is still much to be done to prevent disability in the workplace.
Among them are older: 37% older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a lower level of qualification: 80 per cent do not have the degree of bachelorship, but only 10,000 out of 2.3 million higher education students.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread, which is 85 per cent for persons with disabilities compared to 38 per cent on average.
In short, all these criteria are very difficult to return to work and are a major problem," said Christian Grapen, Director General Tremplyn, an association established in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There's no need to talk about mentality that's changing, but it's too slow.
The study conducted in April by the IMS-Entrepreneur's association on Cité's orders showed that the managers in question had a low level of knowledge of disability and “representing themselves as ordinary people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally inadequate”.
The result is a private company with over 20 employees still far from the goal of 6 per cent of persons with disabilities, as laid down in the Act adopted in 1987.
The last known figures for 2008 amount to 2.6%.
"Today we are about 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General Agefiph, organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of “taxed” organizations, as well as the amounts paid, fell from 59,000 to 46,000 organizations in 2007-2011 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The law of 2005, which raised taxes, created strong pressure on companies, explains Pierre Blan."
"But this improvement also reflects increased awareness, in particular in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of organizations with 20 to 49 employees have 82 per cent of organizations with 100 to 199 employees.
Azar: "What a fortune."
Before meeting with Sini on Tuesday (20.45 p.m.) Eden Azar and George Leekens did not hide the pleasures they had received from this friendly match.
We won't come until we claim that there was a secret contradiction between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting near the Stadium de France arena, George Leekens and Eden Azar agreed.
Five months later, after his attacker's match against Turkey, a Belgian coach can only commend him.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to go on," assures Lila.
As for the contrast between his achievements in the club and in the assembly, that's the whole thing, he's being justified.
"I'm in Lilly for a round year, and there's no Belgium."
"I have to make my eyes."
Left in stock, in front of this match with France, in a game against Romania on Friday night, Azar came to Saint-Dennie to finally "blow".
Not forgetting, however, the notion of pleasure.
He supported the Blues from the age of 7 years and the victory campaigns 1998 and 2000.
"I always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also enhances the particular character of the match.
And especially those on the other side are Mother, John, and Adil, and Ra'mi."
"Our paths just crossed."
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens kindly reminded me of pride.
"Pride" to play in a holiday game.
"Gloriousness" is also claimed to be "neighbor", that France "was once again a very high-level team" all year after the injury in Nice.
"Loran Blanc was like a thunderstorm, he's adorable.
Now that Belgium misses the next Euro, a technical athlete will fly on a blue-man plane... in Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We're building something, toys are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will be convinced of this in future matches, including this against France."
Portugal is very confident
Portugal, Paul Bentu, launched its response match against Bosnia (2200 hours) in Lisbon on Tuesday with great optimism.
On his way both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paul Bentu is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
He had no doubt that the Assembly, in its role since September 2010, would qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a match that must be played, and Bosnia must be won.
Given the 0-0 Friday in Zenica hell, it is clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, it failed to reach the goal of calming her down.
"That's a good result, but it's a risk."
But they, at their brightly lit stadium de la lus in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will go through in the eyes of the audience who must be in awe, although the match will be very tense," said optimistic but discerning Bentu.
"We expect a very tense match, but we are convinced that we can win," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% chance of Euro 2012," said the successor, Carlos Cairo.
No one in the Friday match against Bosnia demands victory from Portuguese.
No one could set up the Bosnians.
"That's a good result, but there's some risk that Bent would regret.
"We will play against a team with a lot of technical dignity and a lot of individual dignity," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the very beginning, "don't give them time to think."
It's a good idea, just this time it's just being realistic.
