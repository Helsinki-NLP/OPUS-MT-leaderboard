I want to be a shrink.
You stay at school.
Do you mind?
Are you coming?
It's all in my mother's.
I'm staying here.
I've seen an earthquake in the zoo.
A thousand nights.
Do you want to go?
Look, a beapolitan tree.
I want this thing, Tom.
I'm big enough.
And that's why he died.
She was like a girl.
You all right?
I don't need any kind.
I lost my heart.
I haven't forgotten.
Where's Gallege?
I want a guitar.
What are you doing?
Good night to you!
I know Tom well.
The list is available.
Are you here?
She was a good girl.
It's cool.
My book is on your desk.
I'll tell you what you want.
It's in private.
Tom didn't know that Mary was capable of speaking French
You!
Look, this is an apricot tree.
The message could not be decrypted.
Skipping all of the pending reply to the mail.
The verve is gone.
I like that.
It can't be.
This is not a phrase.
I'll tell you what you want.
Would you mind if I just wait a minute?
Lous and tears.
Is it white?
Do you have a car?
A thousand friends.
D-Tom doesn't want to go in his father's direction.

Who's got all the cookies?
Don't wait.

It wasn't an error.
Don't talk to me!

I don't care.

Do you still have a head?
Watch out!
He's got a head inside.

Don't leave me alone.
I'm not.

More coffee, please.
He was a bad guy.
Thank you!
The people were playing the ball.
I'll give you a good chance.

NaF, it's funny.
But I don't need anything.
Good night!

Shut up.
I know what you're talking about.
Good night.
Please answer.
I swear to God, Tom.
That's Tom.
I've seen this guy.

You don't have to be in any mode.

Get the door open with you.
Where is the room?
Is Tom here to meet me?
It's good for you.
I like the theory of Vagdalena.
This is my car.
I have to go.
That's enough on the table.
Look, an aberration tree.

This is what you want.
They're still missing.

There's a lot of words in Brazil.
It's black.
I'm sure he is.
A song was sung.
We're on.
Let's go.

There wasn't a father in the house.
They're out of sight.
Opened around the north and reached the car area
You can't talk here.
I need a wing.
It's Tokyo.
You don't want Tom to be a loser like his father.
I'll bet.
You've lost it again.
I saw Tom with this.
It was a huge poor man.
A filter has been added.
I like to travel.
You could've called Tom the police and asked him to.
Just circuses.
People are going home.
I'll keep going.
I'd like a guitar.
My wallet is filled with a filter
Are you sure?
Be careful!
I'm sure I've done something like this every time.
Look at a red-and-red flag.
Yes, I am.
Sunglasses make me feel more like they're flying.
It's the only thing that really happened.
Thank you very much.
Look, it's an orange tree.
Did you get it?
I'm going to go to bed before half a dozen.
Who are you?
How much is that?
A strong ice is waiting.
I live in Japan.
I'm not special.
Naf!
When did you get it?
Tom's playing rugby.
Sunday's the last day of the week.
I'll hold on.
This isn't my place.
Look, a pink akasia tree.
How many times is this timer?
It's white.
I'm stupid.
I've got some questions for you.
Friends do things together.
It wasn't for me.
It's late.
I've seen him run.
It's a y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y

Thank you very much.
I see something.
Tom is capable of making people do things for him.
Tom wins.
Tom's got three.
Debrit would have done it!
I'm better off.
Get out of the way.
Who's this guy?
Thank you.
Just white, please.
There's been a bunch of them under the table.
It wasn't like that, was it?
Is he there?
I love you.
Tom's gonna get away with it.
Think about it.
I'm sure he is.
I don't like it.
I'm not working.
I'm done.
This movie was a pleasure for Dom and Vari both.
I don't speak Spanish.
If you're done with the whole thing, please give it to me.
I don't know. I don't know.
What are you talking about?
Yeah.
It's time to go.
One's got a little bit of a bitch's ass.

What are you guys doing?
I'm staying here.
Can you get AIDS in return for your privacy?
I want to get something.
Where is the problem going?
I've lost my mind.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
You got the money?
I'm not gonna do that.
They're not listening.
You used to love me.
Is it empty?

Have you ever been to Paris?
Tell me what you want.
Check it out.
I don't know.
Call the police.
He thinks he's crazy.
It's just games.

I've lost my mind.
Tom's got nouns that understand Galician.
I don't speak Japanese.
Listen to me.
I know what you're doing.
Galician is not interested in any of these.
Where's Galleg talk?
Noise is covered with a thin layer that is too wide for
He's got a house.
That's what I'm thinking.
You'll never get away with it.
Thank you, Yukina.
And you're safe?
It's over.
Ask for Paris.
I've come to fight.
You'd better not go.
No error message.
I'm sick of it.
Thank you, my brother.
Where's Gallege?
He came with me!
About you?
I heard he's leaving.
I wish you would have lost me.
Nan, it's so funny.
A beer, please!
You took everything.
Who's this guy?
I've got two kids.
Look, this is a tree.
Do you have two computers?
I'm a kid.
It's just art.
I don't care about anything.
I'm sure you're all right.
Do you speak Japanese?
I'm trying to learn English.
Are you jealous?
I don't know.
This is not a major error.
This is not a major error.
I'm not working.
Oh, my God.
I know Tom well.
Have you ever been to Paris?
I didn't take any files.
I'm one of the laborers.
Naf, what?
I didn't listen.
Are you kidding me?
How much does a piece cost?
I haven't lost my mind.
Thank you.
I didn't take any strangulation.
I'll check you out.

How long has this clock been going on?
To be soft means to at least have a good quality - you'll have a lot of fun.
Can I have some coffee?
I've been hit by a crash.
It was a mess.
One's got a little bit like a lucid stick.
Where's Galleg's talk?
There's a known language in each language.
The friends are doing things together.
Stay home.
I want to see you in the dark.
I'd rather die than be without Fail.
I'm one of them.
NaF, it's great.
Tom's on the shore.
That's not a phrase.
Good night!
The car's blue.
They sang a song.
Look, there's a pattern.
Thank you.
It's big and great.
I'm not waiting.
She's reading it.
There's two pages.
Thank you, Yukina.
He was a poor man.
I'm gonna get you a head in there.
There's no reason to be spontaneous.
Did you find Tom?
I think he's got this.
They're leaving.
There's still a cup of coffee, please.
You can only get along with them.
Yeah.
No, thank you.
Is Tom here?
Tell me what you want.
I'm sure you didn't say anything.
There's something you can see.
This phrase is not Irish.
The car's blue.
He's going to be a laborer.
"What time is it?" "It's half an hour."
It didn't work.
He was saving Tom.
I can't.
I need another one.
Are you kidding me?
I don't know.
He was a very poor man.
Aonic's Tom.
How much is this sample?
I'd like that.
Do you like it?
Where'd he go?
There's a lot of honor.
I couldn't sleep.
They need friends.
Who's got all the cookies?
He was three years old.
I'm gonna go to school tonight.
Khalifa Bay is the world's highest skyscraper.
Tom and tom and tom.
Look at me.
Rugby's playing Tom.
I know he won't talk to you.
Death's early.
It's hot today.
He was poor.
It's too much room.
I thought Tom was dead.
Will Tom meet me?
Give it to you in Tatoeba.
Thank you!
I turn what I want!
Poor-du is her.
The head's fine.
Look, a juicy tree.
I'll try again.
It's all in my mother's.
