The Prague Stock Exchange ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
The transactions in ČEZ actions reached approximately half of the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of Tuesday, responded immediately to the fall of Monday when it fell about 6 per cent.
The decline this time is due to the fall of the shares on Wall Street.
It also expresses the market reaction to the outcome of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives who refused to support the plan for the stabilization of the financial sector secretary.
Drop of shares in Asia
The shares of the Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although during the day the index finally lowered some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange index during its financial trip marked almost four per cent, although later it lowered its losses by reducing the decline by almost 2.5 per cent.
The Hong Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the movements of Chinese shares in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, dropped by 3.8%, and the markets in Shanghai were closed.
Sidney's Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually losses went down to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the Index Secretary, went down to 3.6 percent.
"The ransom actions planned in the United States are unsafe and this affects the financial market of the world," said the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, that is, independent of the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong interest rates are at the same level as those of the United States.
American legislators should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and adopt a proposal to support the financial system.
In other words, there is a threat that falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloody bath of American action
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the financial support plan to which $700 billion (almost 12 billion crowns) should be devoted.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would resolve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, American actions experienced a bloodbath and mainly the index of actions collected the largest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped to almost seven percent. A similar volume drop was last recorded in 1987.
The index went down before it was announced, but as soon as it was shown that the Assembly proposal was not coming forward, the index began to fall freely.
Congress withdraws: The U.S. government can inject $700 billion into the bank
The highest representatives of Congress and Government, President George W. Bush, agreed in a comprehensive agreement on financial assistance to the American financial system.
Your vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
American legislators have created a gap in the discussions on the approval of the ransom plan in its form of aid to the American financial system with the amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 billion).
However, it is not yet gained.
Congressors must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and be voted on.
The financial system support plan will be discussed Monday in the Assembly of Representatives.
He told the agency Reuters, Barney Frank, President of the Committee on Financial Services and the Bank of the Assembly on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, it will arrive at the "decoupling" thanks to the complex mechanisms which the market will also achieve in practice.
Paulson: The plan should be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have resolved our disconcerting views on how the package should have measures for market stabilization," said Democrat Nancy Pelosíá to Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met on Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a final form to the Government Fund.
This should buy from financial corporations unsold mortgage assets that lead financial corporations to long-term losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are about to conclude the agreement on the plan, which will work and should also be effective on the market.
It is still necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we are already on it," Paulson said.
A sign for Asian business
The global financial crisis has a strong impact on the stock market that is rapidly declining.
According to the Democratic Senator for Nevada, Harry Reid, legislators are doing their utmost to ensure that the Congress finally approves an agreement this Sunday.
They want to calm down investors' business in front of the Asian finance market as these are those in the first time zone and where Congress could influence Monday's trade.
For now, however, there is nothing clear about when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote and, even if they will not be blocked at the last moment with any problem.
The legislators believe it will be adopted in the next few days.
The law, however, will suffer a series of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion have to be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
However, Congress could block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the programme did not fulfil its function, which would amount to another $100 billion and, later, to the last 350 billion dollars.
Bush assessed the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the President may vote in favour of this decision, but the Congress may vote in favour of his vote by a majority.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the programme was maintained that it was to earn financial resources for the repurchasing of bad mortgage securities whose value had fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay off their mortgages.
"We've worked everything.
The Assembly of Representatives should be prepared to vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the progress of Saturday and that he values "the commitment of both sides to stabilise our financial market and protect our economy".
Limitation of the armoured contract
The chairman of the Senate's Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, head of negotiators, said that the legislators decided on the responsibility of the programme's money for the protection of taxpayers' taxes of their losses, a relieving closure of the planned financial plan.
The new law should also limit so-called protected contracts for directors of participating companies of the programme, and set up a committee to have control of the Fund.
This should be directed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it, and we have made great progress towards the agreement that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also has to help homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree with the new mortgage payments that it purchases in order to lower the monthly charges for payments within the time limits of the debtors and enable them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological assistance
The proposed plan is, according to the economic leader of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but quite difficult.
"And that's why you don't know what mechanism and at what price problem assets will be bought.
This will be crucial for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is approved now or in the beginning of next week, according to Marek, it is not so relevant.
"More importantly, this week Congressors agree on their support and give you their good vision as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement that comes to this approval is, at this point, the most important," Marek insisted.
Armed hand combat: the MP3 Player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost everything mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
Which seems clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
There are still enough reasons for man to acquire only the player.
The choice depends practically on how it is used and on the requirement of the future owner.
It will probably be hard to get the most modern toy to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
On the other hand, this type of music products such as LP discs are no longer out, and as far as their quality is concerned, there is no one objective reason to continue to buy them.
If vinyl discs with music of art rock, jazz or blues are swallowed in their barns, you are probably dreaming, at least, with this type of toca disc.
This is the same with the music that is on the way, i.e. compressed, simplified music - music in MP3.
And here there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns in a player, just like for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try the shopping helmets from twenty crowns.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
Also decides the battery duration
Some of the best players get much more than playing music and even that which doesn't even most of the mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In front of the most elementary functions such as calling, sending messages, can play music and video, record both, have a better or worse camera and even get to navigate.
And when we consider the Smartphone and the PDA will also have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a small miracle because no fridge can make a mess and no television can take pictures.
The universality of mobiles also brings us disadvantages.
How many more functions are used on the mobile before the display indicator will be lit by requesting to be recharged.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy tragedies.
Few mobile phones can play more than ten or twelve hours, most of them much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest) clearly have more performance.
Therefore, be aware that cheap mobiles will not reproduce for more than two hours.
If, in addition to this, above, they constantly call for even more safety, a loader for work - this is also valid for the most expensive appliances.
With the MP3 player this problem is not going to have it, because even the worst are going to last for at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem occurs when recording music on the phone.
Unfortunately, only one part of the devices have the universal USB connector and, in addition, not all of them can connect directly to the computer without a special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some unreduced reading units can be connected to the small memory cards used in mobile phones.
In the players, with no exception (iPod), there is no need for any special software.
Just fill the device with music through the computer's USB.
Most mobiles and players create their order only in the music library according to the name of the interpreter, album title, gender or also according to the user evaluation.
Some devices only show a directory with a tree structure similar to a Windows Searcher and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
The player is trying to serve, the mobile knows more
For the selection of a specific team, it is interested in the battery resistance, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to music as a background and will listen to it every day only for a moment, as in the trance, then enough with any cell phone you play.
What practically gets really any mobile.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or the player plays the music.
The MP3 reproduces it all and almost all the music that comes to you will be in this format.
It is among the most extensive and with the exception of the absolute majority of the devices play music in WMA format.
The least includes the AAC format (format used by Apple and its iPod).
The best mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of online music.
It is enough through the mobile internet to visit the operator's (or any other service provider) competent pages and buy a song or album.
This service could only be a weight argument to acquire a mobile for music.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable, and most are limited only to successful themes that run away from the radios.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that this particular way of selling music (whether by GSM, Internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always have a mobile.
Whenever you want to hear something, you will find your cell phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends whether you always carry a few earphones or at least the handsfrees.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has practically every mobile though at least one MP3 player.
Probably the greatest advantage for many of the music mobiles will be their price.
The cheapest usually costs less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will limit the absence of an entry for classic earpieces.
The best, even with regard to the technical part, such as phones equipped with a 3.5 mm input for classic earphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - in no way necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - really manages them any person.
The minimum functions, their handling similar to the previous current tapes or also to the touchpads are obvious.
It does not pose a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the Internet with the mobile and, consequently, a giant account for data loss.
Which device to decide on
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card will reach the two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
The basic models are usually equipped with only a 2 GB maximum capacity card.
Only the cheapest ones have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile and want to buy yet a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
According to capacity (up to 2 GB) there is no need to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you consider yourself among the most demanding lovers of music to be the hand of the most specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman mobiles have almost identical use as an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same price category over the four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the above mark may bring you MP3 players.
The first virtual operator is coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, here we still need something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It's probably not going to be long.
That the Czech operators are part of the most expensive in Europe, we have already written it on mobile.cz.
The rest also confirmed it by the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is among the most expensive in the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of roaming rates regulation, it is likely that there will be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators sending SMS from abroad will be cheaper than if they were sent from home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lack of competition that you really want to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us because we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that there is an extreme competition in the Czech market.
That is why the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, has already said that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It may be true that for a classic operator with his own network no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Exactly the virtual operator's entry into the mobile telephony market brought a significant price downturn, which the classic operators also had to react to.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the Britain market, voices were heard both there and here.
It has been demonstrated that there is room for such operators and that they can succeed.
However, there is no need to look for examples too far away.
In February this year we inform you about the scene of the virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
Only after half a year did this operator get over 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighbouring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking the Penta group is located which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:phone.
The advantage of virtual operators is possible to focus on many more specific target groups.
In addition, so that they can function effectively, they are sufficient with many less customers than a classic operator.
They do not bear relatively high costs in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world this type of virtual operators are usually profiled with low costs - they offer cheap SMS calls and messages that, however, often conflict with the offer of more adjusted services.
Thus, for example, Mobile Tesco in Britain offers SMS at least half of the cost of competition.
However, as shown by the example of Mobilking in Poland, it can also be a good blow to bet on a goal group.
This operator is specifically directed to man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - he is the operator who likes and who can be trusted," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a concept like that of Poland could get stuck in our country.
Thus, Vodafone spokesperson Miroslav Čepýký says: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the offer of services, it is relatively saturated"
There is no possibility in the Czech Republic, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be any virtual operator in the Czech Republic that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic does not seem too hopeful.
It is more about the launch of Mobilking in other countries of our region," said Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
He indirectly ensured that the current mobile telephone operators in the Czech Republic would not necessarily be inclined towards this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible to avoid any potential competition.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step further to become a real competition for Phone O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in this, so that we can offer our customers not only fixed telephone services but also mobile telephony.
And how much earlier, better.
With this possibility we have repeatedly met with all Czech mobile telephone operators.
With some of them we have managed to move forward at the meetings," said the spokesperson of the group, Pavel Kaidl.
Well, then, maybe they're wasting better times.
It seems that, for non-official information, the first official operator would have to arrive possibly by the end of the year.
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At this point we believe that the situation is suitable for the appearance of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has addressed us with some complex and serious project in this field," said Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesman for Telefónica O2.
The specificity of the Czech market refers to other operators.
The spokesperson for T-mobile, Martina Kemrová, in accordance with the opinion of O2, adds: "To date we have not registered any viable commercial project which, bilaterally beneficial, can continue to develop."
And he adds: "In the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find any virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this point we should already have on the table some specific contract that could be studied in such short horizon."
Vodafone directs its attention rather to the fulfilment of the own requirements of a 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepýký adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this concerns the distribution of expenditure and infrastructure.
We consider this to be the greatest contribution from the point of view of our customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field is in the partner with whom to establish a network shared for a fast internet on the mobile."
Offices responsible - with operators nail and meat
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increased competition which would lead to a price downturn and thus to a fall in profits.
Then why make it easier to enter the competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull out of the same rope, proof of that is the grip when U:phone came up.
Perhaps the greatest pressure on ČTU was at the time of U:phone's entry into the company T-Mobile.
You can see the public information available on the ČTU website.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds: "In addition, it is not long ago that the competitive environment in the mobile telephony market was opened to a fourth operator.
With regard to the nature of the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would be for him and, above all, for his large services."
That is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging because of the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
This is not just the position of the ČTU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tenders (UOHS).
However, this expressed its typical attitude to this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile telephony market would be possible after a contract on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile telephony operator and a virtual operator is concluded.
To date, no agreement has been concluded as the offer of the potential stakeholders was not sufficiently interesting for the classical operators," added Kristian Chalupa, of the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS.
These statements are not surprising to the representatives of the operators.
For offices that should represent consumers' interests, it is more than just a consideration, besides that they should note that no one takes advantage of their position on the market.
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country where virtual operators are normally operating, we can see that their market entry contributed to the lower prices of mobile telephony services"
Obviously, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market's media and the lower prices are not within the interest of the UOHS.
The truly dramatic shock in all this case is the disunity of the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a coincidence is offered on its own.
It is the same as the price of petrol in the gas stations as it is clear that it is a work of chance and a hard struggle for competition.
"The Office in this regard has not found signs of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, therefore they do not have a corresponding rise in responsibility in their market operations.
The tools needed to open the mobile telephony market to virtual operators are missing, as well as telecommunications regulators," Chalupa added.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many conflicting points.
There is evidently an analysis of relevant markets developed by the ČTU according to which telecommunications is from the point of view of the commercial tender a single market.
In this kind of market, of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - for a virtual operator to emerge it is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile phone operator - with all his logic - has the monopoly of his network.
Therefore, in a particular segment, it must be dominant.
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for ÚOHS it should be a warning that three mobile operators would come forward in a similar way.
Current complaints from stakeholders (including GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with operators there are many similar obstacles.
Loading responsibility in ČTU is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications from which UOHS washes hands in this whole matter.
We've already met with him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the Telecommunications Act for the extension of ČTU's competence in the field of commercial tenders which was not effective was introduced recently, even when a number of experts promised that the situation would improve.
This must be fully known by the representatives of UOHS, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere.
It's okay when no one sees
At the same time, unconsciously, something like a pseudovirtual operator continues to work that in Czech mobile telephony networks a few already exist.
They are companies that place their own prices on mobile telephony services which, however, are only part public.
This is usually about companies that are dedicated to multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile telephony services.
Usually only some elected ones get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business client of the company carrying a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions in all Czech mobile telephone operators prohibit such return.
"If cases such as those cited could be found to be infringing under the terms of the contract that could be translated at the end of the collaboration with the society in question," answered Martina Kemrová to the question about this problem.
But it is quite unlikely that this kind of activity carried out by mobile telephone operators would not reach people responsible.
It is precisely in the case of the three companies mentioned above that thousands of customers can be treated.
None of the operators are opposed to this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they achieve nothing negligible profits and, at the same time - unlike the true virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepýký warns us of the possible problems: "the law allows for a speculation of this kind, however, the services of this company are used only by a per cent of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card of your phone is not in your name so they can't absolutely have it as a normal customer of the operators."
This is exactly what ČTU should look like.
In addition, there is a new question for the UOHS.
If mobile telephony operators surround their eyes in this kind of procedure, why do they block the virtual operator's entry?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activity and if it is not going to be desired it should not be satisfied with the operators' explanations that they have no idea of this story and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive?
As already clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market brought a significant decline in service prices.
At the same time, in almost all countries where the virtual operator emerged, classical operators tried to protect themselves from this eruption.
The arguments used by these were almost all identical - too small, a market, possibly too saturated, service quality problems, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, regulatory bodies have now intervened and in none of the cases have defended operators but their clients.
Both with formal measures or informal pressure they managed to emerge the first virtual operator and with him they started to emerge more.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory body all this happens as if it were a burning key.
For our experience, we cannot fail to feel that the confusion of the attributes in these cases is good for them.
But we won't be disappointed.
If this information between builders is correct and the virtual operator actually reaches these lands, then the Czech mobile market probably starts moving again.
If any of the operators allows any virtual mobile phone operator to enter, it will be difficult for ÚOHS to remain indifferent to the refusal (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose Best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Czech official celebrations introduced the new official recording of the hymn Where, my home.
The new hymn recorded the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one male voice and one female voice, one with Coro and another instrumental.
Del canto is responsible for Katerina Kněžinková y Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the arrangements of the hymn are Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krkek.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to the four versions.
Bělohlávek considers this national Czech song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio already said that it deliberately chose for the Singers Alone with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried with both and after, also with the Coro that will be fixed in the sentence so that the text is well understood, so that it can have consonance," he commented.
The Czech official hymn celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, my Home sounded for the first time in 1834 in the tables of the State Theatre in the original Czech work Fidlovačka by Josef Kayetán Tyl and arranged with the music of František Škroup.
He won popularity and people made it his own.
The first stanza of the song after the rise of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, part of the official hymn.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
Prague MDD takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, we write in the history of the Prague Transport Company on the date when the first passengers enter the subway, the tram and the bus with an electronic bonus in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can be purchased at this moment by nearly one hundred thousand people who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy the 30-day, 90-day and annual bonus (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time load it on their chip card in the info centres and transport company stations in the Metro, Museum, Móstek, Nadraží Holesovice, Andel, Roztyly, Letnyany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Bonuses can be purchased from yesterday on the Internet on the transport company’s pages, www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred people until the afternoon.
Those who start using the Internet as a form of trade can definitely start to forget the ticket sales stations in the metro stations, where they had to regularly take a round to get a normal ticket.
The bonus is purchased online, and the Opencard card is recharged in one of the 13 branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is available to passengers a window with prepared staff that helps interested people with online purchases and also with the recharge of the bonus purchased on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic bonus on the Opencard in the vending machines located in some of the metro lobbyes.
How are these expensive machines?
They are red, they remind us of a ticketing machine and the travelers will probably have already been fixed in them at the stations of the Roztyly Metro, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the city but at the end of the year there would have to be eighty," Opatrný said.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Just enter in it the Opencard chip card and the previously paid bonus will be loaded only in it.
The electronic bonds since tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the roundabout trains and bus lines from 300 to 499 that mainly use the inhabitants of central Bohemia.
"In the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague, there are auditors equipped with a reading card that will help confirm the validity of the time and zone of the bonus," explained the control of the tickets, Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid, which sets the timetables for the collective transport of Prague.
Circuit buses have their reading cards mounted in the driver’s tachyllus.
Upon entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to accompany it with the Opencard in the place intended for it on the side of the Box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonuses there is nothing easier than to ask the driver for this information," Drápal said.
Passengers who do not travel on the surrounding buses and do not remember when they finish the bonus validity can be addressed to the forwarding machines where the cards are recharged.
Here you will see information about the validity of your document on the computer screen.
The Southeast wanted to be part of the United States in a referendum
In 1945 the German Sudets requested that Fumaba be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this desire, some German groups of the Sudets were allegedly addressed to the U.S. President in 1945.
It follows from the letters that are stored in a particular file and that are now stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in a letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "land of Shumava" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - again to Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we really want his word that American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators" is written in the letter, signed with a "people who carry the destiny of Shumava in their hearts."
Given that the union of Czechoslovakia with the south-eastern Germans allegedly implies - according to this Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, incomprehensibility, pressure and slavery, the authors pray in the letter to the American president who assumes today and forever to Shumava under a protector.
"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants, we are handed over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that it fully cooperates with the victory of the allies," the letter writes.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is supposedly the fear of reprisals of the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. President was suspected to doubt this idea of the Germans, it would be enough to organize a referendum on whether their inhabitants want to be part of the U.S. or live under their patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the knowledge we have in the post-war history, may sound a little childish, some experts say it paints closely the expectations of the Germans of the south-east from then on.
Although the Czech Germans must have at least assumed that they were going to deal with their expulsion from the republic only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Britain would negotiate for the Sudets in a clear way of autonomy.
Others thought they'd stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed even by Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
This was in the war, as a German of Budějovice, surrounded by the Baltic Navy.
When the British arrested him at the end of the war and placed him in the camp of prisoners of Holstein, dozens of Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought when they came home, the Czech would be good for them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, counted that on the basis of the Goods Decrees they would be far from the Republic.
Don't think--pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
In this way, the emotional Campaign that decided to launch the Ministry of Transport in the media on Wednesday could be characterized.
The Minister's office, Aleš Rébíček, promises to deter drivers from dangerous conduct at the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will be heard on television, radio, cinema, the Internet and in brochures.
I'd have to deter the driver from high-speed and alcohol to the steering wheel.
And also to remind them that the belts are reached before they are launched.
He wants to get to the attention of young drivers, drivers, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Basically human stories that embitter emotions.
And for this we are testified by the "blood ads" throughout the campaign:
Don't think--pay!
The word "Do not think" is written with large letters in the matrix.
And in a bloodthirsty is the word "pays."
This should symbolize that a man at a time of dismissal can pay with his own life.
The ads will "fear" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign in Anglo-Sionese lands where strong images of victims of accidents can be observed.
Promises that this will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on the Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and milk for drivers
"The sugar and milk system is worth the drivers.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a red sesame passes and thus saves time.
The batigo is threatened by a fine or an accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks," says the hospital transport psychologist Na Homolce, Martin Kořán.
That is why an information campaign is needed in the press and, above all, a negative advertising, specifically the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of any danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," warned Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all areas occupied for peace
The president of the provisional government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, spoke of the restoration of virtually all lands occupied in 1967, namely West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Highs, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we must return almost all the lands (occupied) if not all," Olmert said in the newspaper.
"Surely we will stay with a few percent of these lands, but we will have to give Palestinians one percent similar (of the lands of Israel) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that in the event of a return, Jerusalem would also be included this.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to pass over his feet as he passed to one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem," Olmert pointed out in reference to the two July attacks in the city where several dead and dozens of people were wounded.
According to the president it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the hill of the Temple, a sacred and historic place" located within the ancient city.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate into 270,000 Arabs.
This won't work," he insisted later.
Withdrawal of the Highs of the Golan
Olmert also spoke of the withdrawal of Israel from the High Golan, which from his point of view is an inherent condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also entail concrete efforts by Damascus.
"I do not intend to make peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians well know what they will have to get rid of in order to win the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran, they will have to abandon their relations with Hezbula (Chinan Movement), they will have to renounce the continued support of Hamas (Chinan Movement), Al Qaeda (Terrorist Network) and Yihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the prime minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are bus raids illegal?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long bus
Regarding the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency near the Italian city of Padua, we have a question as to whether the airlines and passengers can move by bus during the trip.
"If we wish to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the sozafat is opposed to the road traffic law," says the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which he died last week was twenty-two years ago, obviously caused by the truck driver only when the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the less safe place of the vehicle despite having reserved two other sites.
However, the bus can have an accident or stop suddenly, and at the exact moment when the soda distributes the coffee or newspapers.
Here what the paper plays is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permission, with standing places.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must sit down.
The long-distance buses of the Student Agency do not have places to walk, which confirmed the company's director Radim Jancúra, a Aktuální.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally this was withdrawn and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is in progress if they have a seat," he said.
Azafata doesn't know the law
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the sozafata - no legal provision clarifys this function.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term 'Vehicle Auditor' whose rights and obligations are not defined', adds less tacitly, the spokesman Hanzelka.
The director of the Road Traffic Department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorny, thinks otherwise that the law takes sufficient care of this problem.
"It depends if the bus has the approval allowed to have standing places.
That's all," he says.
Buses are divided among the townspeople, where there are places to be on foot and at maximum speed, interurban with places to be on foot with a higher speed permit and long distances without places to walk, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with safety belt.
As on the plane, says the expert
BESIP's expert on transport safety, Jaroslav Horín, does not see any major problems with the movement of the shuttle on the bus.
"During the development of the journey there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared to the service on the aircraft.
You don't even have the security here that the turbulence comes and that the soda can hit your head."
"However, if the bus suddenly stops that physical laws are valid.
Same as on a city bus or on the train.
The safety of the roof must be solved by the transporter's internal rules," he says, and he also believes that from the point of view of the law, this issue is unresolved.
Janchura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only transporter that offers the azafatas service.
He employs two hundred.
The director, not after the accident, considers this work risky.
"However, at the moment when I have the impression that the seat is at risk, then I will remove it.
Coffee and newspapers can get it, passengers, when they come in.
I would even save expenses," he says.
In the interest of security, it is the reason Asiana lacks breath in her vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
"We don't have charms, we've been against them from the beginning.
Before or after this will end in a fatal accident," he said less than a year ago for Týden.cz.
A Great Tragedy Has Happened
In the accident of the line connecting to Naples, a young man from Pilsen died who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck that probably swirled from the parking car blocking the pass to the bus. without using the intermittents.
His driver tried to avoid it in a quick maneuver, but he was shocked with the right front.
Jancura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the rest of the roof were sold.
"These sites cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to claim the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation of the girl ' s family but will also wait for the financial costs for the guilty party.
Law reform?
No, for now
The reform of the law could bring more precision on the movement of the ambulance on the bus in which for a year now thirty experts from a group of the Ministry of Transport are working.
"However, they have not reached any concrete conclusion.
They are not too devoted to the buses, but rather to the point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile during the march," says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of ambulances to be a major threat to passenger safety," concluded spokesperson Hanzelka, saying that bus security control is the responsibility of the police and the Security Office at work.
Dusseldorf's hope rests in Frankfurt
In the letter of the West LB Bank's Board of Directors for its collaborators, there are few words missing.
The merger of the Dusseldorf bank units with the DEKA bank can form ‘a central capital market of the financial group of Sparkassen’, as the paper states, published on Monday
The West LB bank, breaking down the ‘competence block’ with sustainable profitability would enter into such a business.
In addition, such a merger may be a beginning for subsequent mergers in the area of regional banks.
This is how the text is understood when a board of directors wants to show the ability to act in difficult times.
Because just like the West LB was under a lot of pressure before.
Not only the part of the European Union but also the Federal Institute for the Monitoring of Financial Services recently made it clear to the Government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there is little time left to find a solution.
For a long time now, also on the Frankfurt side, much has been said about the union of this kind between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse customers know about their investment funds, and West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, the head of DEKA, presenting the data after half a year by the end of August, said he saw no sense in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße Street, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the DEKA Board of Directors, which is now composed of the regional banks and Sparkassen associations, commissioned a board of directors to start negotiations with West LB on common commercial activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or some parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, as is said at the financial site.
This is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the area of Sparkassen the name of the DEKA bank appears that with its 3000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003, the situation seemed to be so that the DEKA bank could merge with the regional bank of Renania-Palatinate and with Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was unsuccessful.
Only plans were made public, the Hesse government expressed itself against Helab's participation in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of the Rhine-Palatinate began the dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But it was always played again with the idea of merging the DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But Günther Merl, president of the Helaba Board of Directors, said he was opposed to the plans of coexistence with his bank.
Independent of that, it seems more clear that the union of the different public law banks is necessary.
When the Bavarian Parliament elections are to pass, the BayernLB union with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank could make progress.
For Helaba that is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure continues to merge, Helaba will miss the partners to do so.
In the south the bank could only be a young partner, although so far it was much better than the financial crisis that the Stuttgart and Munich real estate had done.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which has 85 percent of Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided coexistence plans with West LB.
In any case, only the North LB is left.
But these geostrategic reflections form only one part.
On the other hand, it is the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a commercial model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband had so far given no answer.
In the end the West LB can be decomposed, but that is, of course, not the bank's own desire.
Thus, also in the letter of the Bank's Board of Directors, it is said that a complete solution would be sought for the entire Bank
As the coexistence between individual parts of the bank can be combined with the DEKA, that will show time.
The second weekend of Octoberfest is known as "the weekend of Italians"
For Elena it's the first time, for Luca the third or fourth.
But this time, Elena attended him as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a barrel of 5 litres of Kaiser brand beer is built a huge bone tiger that shows almost 200 Octoberfest participants that low sounds can produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a palmade, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From there, from the parking next to the Porta Nuova train station, tonight at 23:45 three buses come out, `direct Munich, the beer party', expected to arrive at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are intended especially for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the parking corners next to their flag are singing the South American, they had already begun to celebrate at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver tiles, belongs to these buses.
For five years they have come to Octoberfest, considering that there are only three excursions this year.
At night on the way there, during the day on the beach, at 22.30 a.m.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the reception of the welcome with a Kaiser beer that was made under Bavarian purity law, disease insurance and German guide- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the road on the highway with the direction "Brenner"
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly the calm queen on the bus, the travelers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the forces.
They go to Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian registration take another break on the bus 8 shortly before Munich.
Finally, when the Marco group is expected to arrive at 6.30 a.m. in the parking lot next to the Plaza de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses throughout Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, you put on a yellow hat.
There, on the left is written "Oktoberfest", next to the Gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "conscersiviagando.it".
Second: "When the doors of the campaign shop are opened, that means marching!", Marco shouts in the morning.
"Go!" go and occupy the rear seats in the campaign store.
"Don't take the front seats, because we're going to block, and all with yellow hair don't sit in the same bench, divided by all the space!"
A liter of beer, rusty Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Do not forget the tip
Show the security people that we have good tone!
As soon as he gets out of his place, he'll be busy!"
Third, "This afternoon exactly at ten and a half you have to come here!"
And now they're all going to October party.
One, to mark the way, even the yellow hats in the trees, traffic signs and even in a cartel of the elections of a great Popular Party of Bavaria.
You want to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Octoberfest that is known as "the weekend of Italians"
There are no accurate data on the number of people; it is 50,000 people who travel on the Alps and are stormyly entering the campaign shops, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend of Italy.
The Munich police receive assistance from seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Red Cross of Bavaria, which makes statistics of the nations present, where the Italians, with over 200 medical assistance, take the first place in front of the English (about 60 assistance) and the Austrians.
The favorite Italian campaign shop is called Hofbräuzelt.
Nights sleepless for the creditors of the Real Estate Hypo
Germany's banking system is relatively stable, only the Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück stressed last week.
Well, that the politician would use the word "relatively" and added that the German banking area would also be affected by critical trends.
And that's what happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), Munich real estate finance, which is quoted in the DAX index, receives from a consortium of German banks a loan of billions to withstand market turbulence.
On Monday, a person who knows the situation very well said to Reuters: credit aid amounted to EUR 35 billion.
The part of the capital that the Real Estate Hypo will use must be of interest.
Money comes from private banks also from public law.
The cause of this is the losses of the Deffa subsidiary.
According to one report, state finances with the money provided for long-term projects have only been financed for them for a short period of time, which is now not as far as possible due to market mistrust.
In the first half of the year, the capital reserve of the bank in cash has fallen by 95 per cent, EUR 2.37 million, and the share of equity has also decreased slightly from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Compared to the same period last year, the continued income from financial investments and net profits of financial transactions fell to zero, the debt tax income and some securities also from the disbursement of credit business provisions amounted to a decrease of more than 70 per cent, in EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the high and high income of the reimbursement of the costs of restructuring the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the federal tax code and the business organized for the consortium companies, the negative balance could cause a deficit of approximately 16 per cent more.
After privatization in 1990, the former state finance at first was lost in speculation with industrial loans for real estate, which served as a basis for the foundation of the Aareal Bank.
Since there could not be much money with the funding of state projects, the Defa began to devote itself intensively to projects in the area of infrastructure and the financing of Community projects by private and public investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and was diversified.
Now the Real Estate Hypo has to make amortizations on the value of the subsidiary that will have a "essential material effect" on the consolidated account of the group's losses and profits, it is said very inaccurate.
It's a fact that the dividends have cancelled.
By 2007, they had been cancelled to two thirds.
Following the acquisition of the Deffa, the Real Estate Hypo became a major state and financial financial in the area of infrastructure.
As the bank does not have customer deposits, it, compared to other banks, is more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the collapse of the U.S. Investment Bank Lehman Brothers, which has happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank credits was essentially lower because the banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year, the Real Estate Hypo takes almost EUR 50 billion to finance part of the Defa's credit portfolios of its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the report of the Real Estate Hypo, the bank with a credit covers the need for group financing for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of international monetary markets that are now essentially not fit to function"
Other sources say that thanks to this money, refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, president of the Real Estate Hypo-Directive Board, explained that the Real Estate Group would not need the monetary markets for the foreseeable time.
The German Central Bank and the Federal Institute for the Monitoring of Financial Services (BaFin) are based on the fact that the competitiveness of the Real Estate Group is ensured from now on.
That is what shareholders and creditors of the bank have to expect.
But because of the dynamics and the impermeability of the crisis, there is no consistency.
It is even imaginable that there is no need for funding in its full volume.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
The voice was that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost in insolvency, so temporary rescue can not at least calm down people concerned.
The action price fell to 75 per cent, EUR 3.30.
The loan courses, on the other hand, are really good.
While the priority debts are almost unchanged, the loan rates according to the position in the property register clearly tend to be lower.
The loans are mainly affected by the loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and the loans that are due to expire in 2009.
Following the remarkable growth of the bank crisis and the acquisition of the Deffa that affected the Real Estate Hypo, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculation must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While the issuing banks, governments and banks that are not affected are still ready to support the system, so much so that pensions can be decommissioned within time.
Or something's going to happen, which is not likely to happen to anyone -- the financial crisis is going to be over in the next 15 months.
But when we saw the cross-referenced news about partial stabilization, now the security that is already within its limits became a legitimate hope.
That will be a reason, because creditors will spend the night without sleep, breaking their head over the decision about their isolation of enthusiasm.
Short-term investors can still put the end point and use the transport to a new account of the losses for future payments of profits compensation tax on change in the future.
Sylvana and the Secrets of Bent?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to appear at the Tachibana High School, the girls began to laugh: German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on exchanges she tells Japan.
"The first day in a college in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to college, I was afraid.
I live on the coast of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and go on a 40-minute train to Tachibana High School.
I just had to find the way. Lucky I didn't lose.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not as strict as in my house in Lower Saxony.
From eight o'clock in the morning students come, at nine o'clock they start a small meeting with teachers, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, I had to introduce myself.
Moreover, I am not a person who speaks with great pleasure in the public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform, I put an old skirt from my host family's mother and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, so dressed I put on my pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and in a week will be my birthday.
I was very happy at this moment because I had been studying this language for two years.
All 31 girls in the class have cooked, laughed and made signs and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her about my Mangas.
That belongs to Japanese girls' survival vocabulary and means "mona, beautiful"
Then I quickly slipped into my seat.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was quite quiet, but when the gang sounded, I felt really upset.
Everyone talked at the same time, laughed and asked a lot of questions – at the same time it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then in recreation they all pulled out their Bentos.
My host family's mother also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something other than boring pieces of German bread.
He had rice with herbs, small sausages, pepper salad and algae, fruit and something like meat in tofu mass.
In most cases I have no idea what it is like here in Japan.
Things are rare and have a new taste.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of marine surgeons in the salt, buff!
In Japanese schools sales are not just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a well made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it in the hope of getting to know him better during a recreation.
I read about that in my Manga Comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see it here too.
"Why exactly Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always answered:
"Well, because it fascinates me."
Finally for years I prefer to read Mangas.
To understand comics and culture better, one day I began to study a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I was going to travel there.
Also because I have a bottle of tradition and habits.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of latest technologies and trends; on the other hand, Japan is a country of severe, disciplined and traditional.
As everything is well organized, I still haven't felt lost here although Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
Rats also have feelings
It is said that a rat or a turtle feeling the danger is running away, why is he also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, a neurologist, is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can you control if they feel the same way as we do?
The contributions of famous scientists have been published in an Internet magazine called "Edge" for many years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers chosen to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else could prove it so far, although we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include questions about feeling and in general about consciousness, we enter the unknown because hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as the other animals: it kills, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, some scientists conclude on comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to contaminate our subjective animal experience.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated with the human consciousness of the side frontal lobe of the brain cortex (because of their participation in the short memory and the executive functions that lead to conduct).
This vast part is much more developed in people than in other primitives and seems to be lacking absolutely in other creatures.
Taking into account at least the aspects of our conscience that depend on the frontal lobe of the brain cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man is different from other primitives.
Another particularity lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since most of his experience is connected with language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case animals may be excluded.
But even though consciousness would not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created anyway, in many cases would differ from most of our states of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not allowed to measure because it has the special hardware, nor is it allowed to be analyzed through our experiences, so your research presents us with great problems.
Most of my interventions relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
Animal awareness processes could be investigated without taking into account their content, and that is what happens during short-term memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach that followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the essential thing is to pass on the neutral correlations of consciousness rather than the causal mechanisms: both can be similar or not.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the frontal lobe of the brain cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what's the result of that for the sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is activated that is responsible for it, the same as that which happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defence system (or its consequences such as the body's reactions).
In view of this view, the sensations are very fixed by the brain cortex, which distinguishes the primitives and above all the man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature, classifications of fine sensations continue because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar to describe the states of others by ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damasco, on the other hand, thinks that the sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the brain cortex responsible for the body's feelings and the brain trunk, the same thinks Jaak Pankseep, but focuses more on the brain trunk.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer absolutely to different types and feelings.
For theoretical reasons, I can't go against it, but I don't think it's likely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel like fear, possibly that feels in two cases too: But how can you control whether rats and men behave similarly?
Seeing the danger a cockroach flees, why is he afraid?
I believe that the likeness of behavior still does not test the likeness of experience.
That is true that the neuronal comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, and rabbits on the other hand do not have at least one brain.
Is the brain trunk responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to prove it for men: How can you prove it in case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also mammals (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how he can prove it.
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposed to be fundamentally different from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and to language).
In any case, progress is expected in the field of neurology while the same is measured by rats and men.
Since I don't investigate the language and the consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I don't know if they exist.
It can be said that I do not see beyond my noses, but I prefer to move forward rather than work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Term of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Ivan Wasjunik, the Deputy Prime Minister, said that preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a test of Ukraine's confidence in the ability to organize the European Championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But that is not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and there is much to be done in both countries."
The time for the construction and reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in host countries is short.
The number of stages is likely to be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to do work very quickly," said the president of a Ukrainian Grigorij Surkis association.
"UEFA will not remove our eyes."
A more radical step was taken in Poland.
Following numerous scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish PZPN association and replaced the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that PZPN is unable to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured the President of UEFA Platini that preparations for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
Only in the last season many first division clubs were condemned because of down-handling to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Enraged Dennis Quaid Counterattack
She wanted to promote a new film, she was talking in an interview about private life - and she has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood's star Meg Ryan named her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He's angry and he's coming back.
The late war of the two roses in the former Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid pair: eight years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis was very unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for revealing private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of the failure of a marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his appointment as an unfaithful husband was clear: "This is "unheard how often Meg tells the story of our relationship in another version," said the 54-year-old man to "New York Daily News".
Among other things, it is very "sorry" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, will again "remember in public the pain and the changes, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan lives alone after divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently he is father of twins.
And so it ends with his statement, pointing out: "Whatever my life continues.
I'm happy because I have a wonderful family that's okay."
Flight and hotel ticket prices are down
In the first half of 2008, airline tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a current study, airline tickets in Germany were made cheap even up to 50 percent.
Flight tickets and overnight stays in hotels were made cheap again - this is the result of a study by the American Express Travel Service and Financial Services Provider.
The company has analysed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter, a major change in the second half has been observed.
After many years of hotel market prices continued to increase, overnight stays in many places became cheap.
Compared with last year, between January and March prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe increased by 6.9 percent on average.
From April to June prices have already fallen to 3.6 percent compared last year.
The trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for this was the weakened dollar course, which was the reason that "the interests of US tourists in travel decreased."
The decrease in hotel prices is also noted much more in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannover, Colonia or Stavanger.
In the city of Norway, hotel prices increased to 26.3 per cent and thus hit a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, airline ticket prices also showed upward trends:
Due to the increase in kerosene prices, economic travellers had to pay on average 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-distance flights were even more expensive than 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, air ticket prices in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, fell by an average of 12.5 percent, but the changes in prices for the Business Class and the First Class were small.
In Germany, price change was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices increased to 11.9 in the second half to 23.6 per cent.
According to one study, prices for national flights in Germany even decreased by half.
The cause of price change is on the one hand the increase in the fleet economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the airline travel market demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies Treaty which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit flights in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankrupt - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:1
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia still doesn't go out to make the 10th grade goal.
Kristoff Klein presented very well the forced landing of the national selection player Marko Martin.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed to score.
All I meant by reacting exactly to what happened could be clearly read from his lips.
I just knew I was right.
"We need a second goal," said Hermann Rieger at the entrance of the stadium in Hamburg.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time was over and most of the guests were back in their seats.
Rieger was almost three decades physiotherapist of the HSV, enjoying a very high reputation as one of those who formed part of the group.
That is why his request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach sat down with his head and raised his fingers as a sign of consent.
Cornelius is Martin Jol's brother, Hamburg's chief coach.
His order was the same: Come on, second goal!
But that wasn't done.
"Today it wasn't all nice to see," Marcel Jansen added.
Bastian Reinhard also wanted to have it "more relaxed".
Result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) with its head impact; and also to the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol summarily.
This Monday the SV in Hamburg is going to be 121 years old.
On Saturday, the viewers had already celebrated their own, the blue sky on the stage and the changing table on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to interpret it," said Marcel Jansen.
It provides that the partial qualifications of the table correspond more to the speed of the league than to the domination of its HSV.
The Quip with its players forced late like the Brazilians Snow and Silva, the Petric and Jansen who were taken from FC Bayern need time to join, but the Quip can still not shine with its success.
"We need more of feeling and dribbling," Jol says.
After the vote
Fear spreads on Wall Street.
The first news about the failure of the bank's rescue package left the Down Jones at 700 points.
That was the loss of the biggest points during one day in your history.

The rescue plan plans to make resources available to buy so-called mortgage actions "potrid".
But the sum will be paid by strike but step by step.
As a compensation for this, the State has to receive the option receipts of shares for financial partnerships that may be charged during the course development to reduce the financial burden of the State cash.
Action courses in Europe and those in the United States continue to decline
The aid of billions for banks in Europe and the United States does not reassure investors.
The course of the actions of the great German bank Hypo Real Estate is low and has a negative influence on Dax.
Despite the rescue of the state-designed financial market, the U.S. Dow Jones index continues to fall.
The losses of the speculative actions of the Real Estate Hypo and Commerzbank caused the fall of the German index (Dax) in a large deficit.

Dark matter influences the orbit of space probes
For many years a mystery phenomenon has led researchers to dissatisfaction: the Dark Matter has influenced the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's Relativity Theory cannot be so correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" spent almost 18 years flying into the universe.
Because fuel pipelines are now freezing a death threat in the cold.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver, has caused dissatisfaction among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a guide to the orbit of space probes as they gain acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, for example on Earth.
This allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as did the Sun Ulysses probe.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave 100 percent as expected under the venerable law of gravity.
Speed irregularities are more common.
Suddenly the probes have a higher or lower speed.
Physicals couldn't explain this effect until now.
It was called anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the manoeuvre.
Some experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity that describes the force of attraction of matter by the bending of space cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton, now solemnly believes as before Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during the gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in which the astronomers remained in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly can be the Dark Matter that can also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
The researchers in the universe know the existence of the Dark Matter for only ten years.
It is supposed to possess the force of attraction and its influence can be observed on other planets.
The Dark Matter, on the other hand, is completely invisible which means that it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists, the Dark Matter makes at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed, after ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists abducted in Egypt must be released.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded millions of ransom.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during the release.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The rescue negotiations have already begun.
The Germans always fall again at the kidnappers' attention.
The WELT ONLINE newspaper tells about the most important cases.
In view of the fact that European tourists abducted in the Sahara are free.
The same information is provided by the State Egyptian TV, the Arab Al-Arab television station and the Italian media.
After news of the release in the Italian station Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, Italian Foreign Minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
"Now we control your health," Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well and are in security, inform the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants in the expedition in the desert are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the release of hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard, kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the rescue," the guard said.
It was just "receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
On Sunday, the Sudanese soldiers have killed six kidnappers and two of them have been detained in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money had to deliver the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that liberation was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their security.
According to the report, kidnappers intend to release female hostages after receiving the rescue.
The men had to be arrested until the kidnappers had a safe route to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on this report.
Patriarchal abuse "carried to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, from Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after admitting eight charges of indecent assault.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an inaugural study, knew that he had regularly contacted his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession paper: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court knew that Ms. Randle had committed suicide at her Mutley's house in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Treise used to grab her and sell her eyes before carrying out her sexual acts while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Treise returned to Cornwall.
His daughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court knew that Mrs. Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse she had suffered twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some of Mrs. Rande's friends had said about her, which after being a great surfer and cyclist, now seemed "emotionally dead", as if "refused to life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terraza Randle, found the dead woman in his apartment at Plymouth.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by drowning through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that concluded by saying, "I used to grab her and wave her eyes.
It's never been a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Treise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for his victim it must have been a frightening experience, especially when he was only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim leaving his own life.
More clearly, if she had not done so, the matter would probably not have ended in the courts."
And he added: "I have noticed the effect that, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, abuse had on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future."
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC was informed that an official of the Cabinet who forgot some secret documents on the train in June would be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on his way to work by the Ministry of Defence, left two highly classified documents on the waterloo train.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is certainly the least serious burden under the law and does not imply any indication of the intention to commit a crime.
The BBC correspondent for Defence Frank Gardner said that the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause relating to the protection of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the official should be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work in the Committee on Secret Services.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about Al-Qaeda and the capacity of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and then transferred from his home to a secret place.
Construction companies face B&B price
In Britain, construction companies could face a price of more than 80,000 pounds after the rescue/save of Bradford and Bingley.
The Government, in fact, provided 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million bank savers.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers that the companies and their members must pay
Eventually, the 14 billion loan should be repaid after Bradford and Bingley's mortgages have been redeemed.
However, the interests that become inside are assumed to be charged annually to the 700 financial corporations that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved with caution ... are called upon to pay today the price of the institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
In other words, each of the companies had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and the mediation companies had to pay approximately 18 per cent of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will rise to 450 thousand pounds in 2009.
This means that companies will have to recover 81,000 pounds to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Commercial Association of Construction Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
"It is humiliating that the institutions who behaved with caution in the growth of the real estate market are called upon to pay the price produced by those who were much less prudent."
According to the BSA, there is no data indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
"We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction companies and their members in view of what might be a relevant price," Mr Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of required interests, which can be almost twice as much.
As mutual-organization construction companies and no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interests in their savings.
The price of milk goes up by five pence per litre
The inhabitants of the Jersey road will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the highest price of dairy products will increase by an extra five cents a litre from next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after an increase of two pence in February and following the investigations carried out by a consulting company.
Traders can decide for themselves if they want to apply price increases for their customers.
The last time the highest price of milk had increased before February, it was in 2002.
Refuses freedom under bail to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the request for bail for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be taken to prison when she returns to her country.
His defenders said that the court did not grant him freedom under bail by accusing him of extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) to an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of the various corruption charges against you.
His long-term political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released at the beginning of this month.
The return of Sheikh Hasina to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country's military-supported government grant him full freedom first.
Correspondents say that while he was given conditional freedom to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is now unclear what the terms of his release are or whether he will be able to remain free when he returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers said they would appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the request for freedom under bail for Sheikh Hasina, arguing that he could not obtain freedom under bail because he was already being treated abroad under parole," said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall bring an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court."
Her defenders argued that she needed freedom under bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her homeland after October 17, according to a leader of the Awami League last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the interim government, supported by the army, took power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all the charges they are charged with.
Fears for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan – says the UN – have not been able to benefit from a recent anti-polyomyelitis vaccination campaign due to Taliban violence.
Last week, the United Nations has carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that children could not arrive in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
One United Nations spokesman said that despite the promises made by the Taliban that would not have attacked or impeded thousands of officials while the vaccinations were being carried out, it was happening.
BSkyB loses legal challenge on ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competence Commission after the decision that forced the company to reduce its participation in the rival broadcasting ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Court of Appeal that it will have to reduce its participation of 17.9% in ITV below 7.5%.
Earlier, the Commission said that BSkyB’s interests impede competition and allow its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, on buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopolis Office reported that the acquisition of ITV participation by BSkyB had raised doubts about the independence of ITV and encouraged the Commission of Competence to open an investigation.
All, including the chief of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, the consumer groups and the regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB, commented that the obligation to reduce its package on ITV was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, said BSkyB, he would have surrendered his voting rights.
New Investigation into the Assumption of American Lawyers
The United States Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the action of the administration officials.
The report criticized the officials of the White House, the legislators and former Producer General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether the officers questioned during the investigation have lied to the investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
" Serious complaints of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney General Glenn Bellas said in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. lawyers were removed from office by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department motivated the decision suggesting that lawyers had been dismissed for low performance.
But later it was assumed that lawyers had not been evaluated worse than others, and many observers concluded that dismissals would be motivated by political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on the persecution of Republicans, high profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate complaints of electoral fraud against Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute judicial cases for the government
and may be dismissed at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The next head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under the pressure of dismissal, gave up his position.
A certain number of other officials from the Department of Justice did the same.
The General Prosecutor's report is very critical of the role played by Mr. Gonzales in the matter, and it underlines how he had a "primary responsibility" for the unemployed, who "abdicated" his leadership position and was "notably non-cooperative" in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, the former Bush collaborator, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Epica of Meat Loaf of Great Honor
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for its epic hymn Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will collect the special award next week at the ceremony that will take place in London, said that obtaining this recognition will be "an honor".
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf won in 1977.
The Coldplay group is taking the nominations for this year's awards and making the ranking of the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of the Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that go beyond time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal capacity such as that used by Meat Loaf.
An instrument section of almost two minutes opens the hymn.
The song was first known as a single in the United Kingdom in 1979 and became number 15 in the ranking.
However, Bat Out Of Hell by Meat Loaf remained in the rankings for about nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including surgery for heart arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
Later it emerged that it had a box in its vocal string.
Dark street of the city, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
The city of New York has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others just from service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-term local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends to the North of the First Street – before I found the Second Street – between the Bowery and the Second Avenue.
This skeleton, more than 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty street more than an active road.
There are no signs.
It's practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that recently built luxury buildings on the First Street
who wants to renovate Extra Place and create a clean walk to the shops and shops that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the old-date neighbors who commented they were delighted by the trunked carriage simply because it is one of the last remains of the block's past before the fitting of the buildings.
However, the Department of Housing, Conservation and Development of the city, which has street control, has no interest in owning it.
At the meeting of the Committee on the Environment, which took place this month, representatives of Avalon drew up a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to stay in the city, asked for a new plan to be presented next month, as told by Susan Stizer, the district manager of the Community 3.
"The city is owned today by very few spaces and we would like it to continue to have Extra Place," said Mrs.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and install seats, including some for use as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street came up for the first time during this month's meeting
But Michele de Milly, a spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, he did not necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renewal of this abandoned street and the possibility of converting it into a public area," he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Committee on Preservation, confirmed that it was a city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission was the development of property rather than its management.
Compared to its most colorful surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark in history.
Some believe that he got his name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's great estate was divided between his children and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The rear door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opens in Extra Place, but the street is probably better known for the photograph of the establishment that goes out on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The environment was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of trash, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, sheets, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the arrest of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, even modest ones, must remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, practically unchanged, a king of the city that should be protected.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made part of a story of the city's history on Extra Place, published by The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a little narrow and out-of-the-way street, dark also for the day and marked by doors of an oxidized iron store and counter-windows, with old weekly newspapers blown along the canals."
With few exceptions, the street seemed more or less the same in a recent afternoon.
A rat was curated through the back of the street and stood near the door used to enter the CBGB and is now hosting a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty 22-oz bottle of beer were close to a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some passersby said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested that she could be cleaned.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in their current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, wet and dry places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in English
In this Education Watch chapter, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates' positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in studies about California and director of Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Calling Hispanic voters effectively is a difficult business.
The educational proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of this.
Mr Obama's campaign notes that "African Americans and Latin students have significantly less chances of graduating than white students," and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in the events of learning, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, inter alia, "bilingual transition education" for English students.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers in class education in languages other than English, is effective in canceling the distance in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in the eastern region of the Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and family with low income:
more than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are learning English.
However, an incredible 100 per cent of fourth-year students have been positively evaluated in the 2008 mathematical review.
and almost one equally amazing 93 per cent has dominated the English language test and arts.
This incredible success has been achieved by using a different ingredient that Mr Obama has favored.
The Sixth Street School emphasizes the review and practice, the constant assessment of competences and does not tolerate any excuse attitude.
In addition, and here is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikkels, the head of the Sixth Street, the school's approach for English instruction to students is in the "total immersion".
Immersion in English means almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Ms. Mikkels, who opposes bilingual education, said to me, "We have had extraordinary success with students like this last one who came from Mexico and that, if you went to school 12 months later, you wouldn't be able to pick up what was it."
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate for other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of the party's politicians on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been defenders of bilingual education) and their continued support for bilingual education obscures Mr. Obama's prediction of the answer.
While it is true that immigrants must learn English, Mr Obama has recently trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about the legislation that is written only in English.
And instead, he said, "You must make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should consider carefully the models of education that work well, rather than ignoring them or trivializing them.
The price of oil falls abruptly after renewed economic fears
The oil price was drastically reduced this Monday because of the concern that the American ransom plan for financial markets may not be able to reactivate the economy.
The share of crude oil decreased by 7 per cent, reaching $99.80 per barrel in the morning negotiations at New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis in Wall Street and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before returning, once again, due to huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety took hold of investors once again on Monday, despite the Congress leaders who said they had reached an agreement during the weekend on the ransom plan, the biggest in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will purchase the bank operations of the Watchvia Corporation, as the government said this Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, at the end of the week, the negotiations that led to the rescue agreement "does not seem to have been able to reactivate the feeling of the market."
As the economic situation worsens, it is expected that the demand for basic products, including oil, will be reduced.
"The prospects for global equity, interest rate and exchange rate will be increasingly uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that basic products will not be able to escape this infection.
From the product perspective, our most pressing concern is whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China."
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, such as low oil consumption due to the economic growth crisis and the forecast for oil and gas price reduction is 20 per cent by 2009.
Second crazy room: team sets record
After having passed, during the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in Jets' uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought she had seen everything.
Then he saw things develop on the second room this Sunday, when the Jets turned a non-notation game into a game of deflation.
"I've never seen anything like that," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played with perishable under the shadows of the clouds.
At this moment, the Brett Favre quarterback met Laveranus Coles by achieving a 12-yard goal and suggesting the perfect presage for one afternoon, in which the evolution of the relationship between the players had a great leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the room, one when one cornerback fell and the other arrived with 10 seconds in the middle.
"I didn't get out of my way," said Favre of all the steps that went to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, no matter what people may think."
While Favre and Coles were in custody, the Cardinals' defense was being abused at the Kurt Warner quarterback.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith pointed to another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to miss Warner.
In the last tournament, the flaws imposed by Bowens, could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the balloon, Jay Feely gave him a 20-yard kick to win a final 34-0.
It's the biggest points the Jets never made in a room.
The team coach, Eric Mangini, asked him to describe the madness of this moment, he said, "The second room or the third room?"
When both of them were answered - the Jets allowed 21 points without answer in the third room - Mangini said: "I can say that I liked the second room much more than the third.
They have won a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Relaxed Gebrselasia heads its world record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has shown that many consider her the greatest runner in history, surpassing her own world record in the Berlin marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person able to race 26.2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the comfortable career in wool at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has destroyed for 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has established the world record number 26 in an impressive length race so that she has established a world championship or a world record for any distance, from the counter-clock race to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie did not take part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps in too alarming, in retrospect - that air pollution would exacerbate her problems with asthma.
Instead, he set out to run in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, using medium-term cuttings 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has been reduced in more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa de Brasil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the victory last Sunday, Gebrselassie told reporters that she had suffered cramps in the pantorrilla two weeks before and that she had lost a week of training.
Clearly, the suspension left him fresh, not oxidized.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"All was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I have some doubts, but in the end everything was fine."
The athlete has been criticized - especially in Kenya, the east and east rival of Ethiopia - for the style of orchestrating his careers too, in general, avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, based on the marks as if it were a race track, and putting the records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's skills as a runner.
This Sunday, at the march of four Keenians, Gebrselassie reached the middle of the race at 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to challenge Gebrselasia after her marks decreased.
But just before three miles from the target, Gebrselassie took a last impulse to separate from Kwambai, who ended up second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record for almost five minutes.
Kamathi arrived third place at 2:07:48.
In the female career, Irina Mikitenko, native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a notable year by winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe from Great Britain has the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise and won the London marathon at 2:24:14.
She also did not take part in the Beijing Games for what was described as a back injury, but she recovered to win in Berlin and set her best record staff in almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He made an intelligent calculation career, leaving a quarter of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to make their heads and then recovering them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia won second place at 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop from Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and proof of color life
Hidden from the expansion of the Orlando theme park, just a few kilometres from the bright, noisy and colossal city, there is a quiet village, where pride and complications of African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first fully inhabited town by blacks embedded in the country and the place of Zora Neale Hurston's childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guayabas, two schools and not a prison."
Now it's a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to Zora this year! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described – also making it a tourist phase by including it in the Florida Travel Guide produced by the Federal Writers' Project of the Depression Season – remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, worthy and private as it was in the 1930s when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and doesn't know what's going to be lost."
Even now, in the year that a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to starting a dialogue on the issue of race, many are still being cautious in the face of foreigners.
"We are very cautious about the way our history is told," said Jones Hortense, 59, a resident of all life and a member of the oldest church in the city.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historical model of the claim of black people and a community of nearly 2,400 people living below a double level of poverty of the national average.
It is a literary centre, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the black south - sometimes overlooked, other praised - that was born of slavery in America.
It's no wonder, if those who live here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern about Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as nobody here calls you Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep dialect books like "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the centre of Florida often forgotten into the history of black people and the human drama.
Having a face of cement in both life and literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then inside more private areas.
"Outside the road to the left," he wrote, "there is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well maintained gardens and playgrounds, care for Howard Miller, as he can only read and write."
She also mentions the new husband of the widow Dash and writes that Glenn Lee "is selling drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transitional rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Mrs. Hurston puts into relation Eatonville with the autonomous government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fucker didn't do it.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of the girls Johnson that Mrs. Hurston immortalized by quoting men who were singing colourless songs about her beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like it."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77 years old, remembers that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without notice in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still boasts of wearing with dignity.
Most of the residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcasticly.
"People are always very happy to see Zora," Mr. Franklin continues.
But, add, swinging in her chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten about her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only color woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce - Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no large commemorative ceremonies, no large public readings.
"I don't think her contribution to the world or her heritage was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
The orange County officials wanted to put a five-carrying road across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-carrying street of the labor community.
The expansion of Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the '50s, the struggle for racial mix led to hatred for the community.
"During that season, a group of white boys went around the city throwing oranges and everything against the people who were sitting next to them," said Mr Franklin.
"They also killed a girl once.
They threw him against a car sandwich."
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston wrote the newspaper The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the strong integration by the Supreme Court, which, in Brown v. Board of Education, "insulted instead of honoring my race."
R Residents today say that school degregation, positive in some respects, had weakened the cohesion of Eatonville and undermined the confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - they used to hug the teacher in the morning and at night," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization.
This lasted, added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"I wasn't going to embrace your teacher because she was white - there was a cultural break there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who passed over prejudices, just as she did, with boyant, trust and lines such as: "How can anyone deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous tomb and began to struggle to revive her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in the bookstores, reintroducing it into the American cannons.
The road project came just when the most famous daughter of Eatonville went under the reflectors again.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of admirers arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its proposal for a road.
"The resurrected idea of the five-way road would have been to put what you would call bending speed, a true civic pride," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd said more simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped to change the image of the same city.
People outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church from here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Registry in 1998.
A new library (with the name Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, on a renovated and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: only six miles from the center of Orlando, can sometimes feel like on a street of the past under a summer rain, in a city as small as that which was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Foreigners who come to search for the history of Eatonville, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permit for advance is necessary to do most of the interviews, and some things - such as the walls in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - can not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who is weak by the bright red, still fears that his island community may be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of Christmas pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville in the same way that Mrs. Hurston saw her entire race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and also other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, worker, stupid and mixed.
It is a genuine civic sense what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's 18-year-old nephew, Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins in Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, if they dare to go here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to anyone else'," says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at your history, it's a very nice city."
This way, in New York, everyone talks about finances on a regular basis.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the kiosks and the giant television screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the bee nesting offices located above their heads, bankers and fund managers who monopolies New York face daily the worst "bad day of the office" since the 1929 bay.
Boys for delivery to home continue to resonate their metal carts for tea through the steels and carry muffins flags for breakfast meetings.
Latin men continue to drag between buildings of loaded apartments, as well as human mules, with 50 outer stamping shirts hanging to a yoke through their shoulders. Office workers are still waiting in line for their food to carry in the morning, and it is still impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon on working days.
Employees are still waiting for their luggage to be brought to the seller's carts, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon in the days of the week.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic predictions that exist, I decided to open up a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time needed for the operation to match the calm of the late afternoon at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee's window, to withdraw his cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer's service bank, where lifelong customers order their check-ins, tourists seek instructions to go to Macy's big stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my "personal banker of trust", and they were in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from the smaller banks in places where they had switched them, places such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the Staten Island.
They had taken their money from so-called savings associations (a little like a construction company), from credit unions and from savings boxes in their hometown, whose branches only work within the state of ownership, and who say to treat customers as their family.
During the past year, 15 of these banks have silently failed.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, broke in, and as the New Yorkers headed toward their homes on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with a savings deposit of $440 billion, was looking for a ransom buyer.
The workers of the offices and shops that were standing in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank that is considered a safe refuge, which is doing most of the rescues on Wall Street.
Regular people in New York have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking by phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and her distressed executive director, Dick Full, commented on the matter with familiarity as if they complained about a colleague's inactivity.
And Lyn, 50 and something in uniform from my apartment block, has changed the normal direction of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my purchases at the tender.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "now I have all my savings in money market funds.
Switching's done, I'm not taking any chances."
Prolonged Muslim graves at the time when Austria approaches the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left side of the extreme right party for the freedom of Austria and Filip Dewinter Belgium, affiliated to the extreme right party Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization "Citizens Against Islamization" in Amberes on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signals that represent the mosques with a red line that passes through.
The police are blaming extreme right-wing extremists for profaning a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that extreme right-wing political parties made huge profits in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged in Traun's cemetery, near Linz, at some point between Friday night and this morning, in which the police believe it was an organized action.
The criminals rocked Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David on some of the graves, but researchers believe that this may have happened in an attempt to hide the real motives of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident was somehow related to the elections.
A spokesperson for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the rape, which came to the Muslim religious when Ramadan was about to end.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for an introspection round after the turn to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that reached almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had conducted a campaign focused on the anti-immigration phenomenon and some of its slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against the headsets and burkas, and also expressed his opposition to the foods considered related to Islam.
In his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties seek to ban the construction of mosques and mines, arguing that they were symbols of the current Islamic policy in Austria and Europe.
Investigations and analysis carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the extreme right as the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that the change occurred mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Prohibition of travel abroad for Gary Glitter
The courts have forbidden Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of sexual abuse of children, to travel to France and Spain.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the supervisory authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent ' s police formulated a ban on travelling abroad last Thursday after the judges had produced evidence of Glitter ' s previous convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, a real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, but was represented by lawyer Corker Binning.
A spokesperson for the Judicial Service said: "On Thursday, 25 September, at the Court of Justice of Ashford in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's travel abroad, such as France and Spain, until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad by meeting under the registration of sexual offenders.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary to communicate to the police the scheduled date with seven days in advance of their departure.
Kent's police said I wouldn't discuss the individual case or the possible stop place of Glitter in the county.
A spokesperson for Kent Police said: "Kent police will do their best to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A spokesperson for Kent Police said: "Kent police will do their best to protect children in this country, or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the United Kingdom because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
"Protecting the residents of Kent is Kent's main concern and we work in close cooperation to monitor the behavior of sexual offenders registered in the county and minimize any risk that may exist for the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When Glitter was released he flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through the passport control and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied his entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrates Court, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of Interior reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was calmed and glad to know that they had banned Glitter from travelling to France and Spain.
"Capt to the teacher outside the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No tacos, no flyers, no outer clothing.
The essence of the great flamenco teachers, depleted from the concentration in the interpretation to obtain the relaxed aspect of the man or woman.
The artist's side.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in the privacy, at such times outside the public, when you find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressity of a hand, are concerned because they are not going to come out on stage.
German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some plays with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less known side of these teachers.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of the flamenco from different areas.
Included in the month's programming of Flamenca Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of Flamenco, more every day", explains the creator, who makes it clear that "Flamenco-people" "can be people anytime but, when viewing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These portrayed people "on the street" are artists capable of conveying on stage passion, sadness, joy... arresting the public.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos from the scene.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the great flamenco."
With the taste of the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer started a long trip on 1,997 to portrait the singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material remember classical photography.
The application of different stylistic means breaks with the classic basis of the image, confirming its modernity, which reflects how Bauer himself understands the flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the action of the dance, the song or the touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who captures with his art to the public.
The search for a meeting with the essential, with the idea that it becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the El Fotomata gallery.
Known figures of flamenco such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, configure this selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project has become a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits shown in the sample.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, meet them and be able to enter their lives for a moment, be a long or short moment.
I think inside the photograph portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or face people, characters, sometimes you don't know, or they leave you just a few minutes to take the picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco which bears the title "Flamenco-people" is shown in the Gallery El Fotomata, located on the number 20 of the street of Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where you can visit until the next 16th October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel she writes is "a fear"
It is located in places that still do not know and pour out on unknown matters, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to moving forward the new project he is working on, a novel that has as its protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and passed through the Amazon.
The always favorite to the Nobel Prize of Literature confessed yesterday in his passage by the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that today takes on "is a terror" and that "everything indicates that you shouldn't write" the novel.
"If it were sensible, I wouldn't, but I'll do it and I'll hope to finish it once," she concluded in her intervention at the Festival of Exchange of Ideas, Thoughts and Words that for four days has seen passing through the city of Acueducto to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and Dogs" was one of the prominent figures of the third edition of the festival of the word and fulfilled the predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants - an ancient edition of "Our mutual friend", by Dickens-, filled the audience of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before him a devoted audience who was very short the time when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "place to read" and "live more than what he lived"; how he writes of "disciplined manner" to provide his "inspiration flaw" with an intense documentation work, correcting and re-enacting much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which his stories are supported.
The Hispanic novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if the books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more inconsistent", so he asked the writers "not to give up on cowardice" and "to assume responsibility" his vocation.
Climate change melts the Pozoblanco fair that also remains unrestricted
The regional party that closed the ticket to the Pozoblanco fair was suspended in the morning of yesterday, after checking the announced reunioners that the square floor was not in the best condition.
In this way, the company, according to Fermín Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
Meteorological excellences have crept up with this fair, since at last two of their three parties could not be celebrated.
Saturday was the rain that prevented the second scheduled bull race.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a Castilblanco lock
So, only Friday was a party.
In him was the triumphary Daniel Luque who cut three ears and went out on shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That very evening Alejandro Talavante came out with his two statues with greetings and an ear, which gave more to the tendons than his tore.
Yes, worse still was El Juli, who passed through the thing of Los Llanos without fault or glory.
In his second bull, after a façade of relief, the branch of a large part of the public was won.

They were prosecuted and detained by one of the two occupying officers, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A. J., as reported in a statement by the Department of Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual has been accused of drug trafficking and falsification of public document.
The incident occurred when several officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a transport control in the N-1, at their passage through the municipality term of Arminón.
They were willing to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed the orders, rushed and the control was skipped.
The officers began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of miles later in the arcon, when their two occupants stopped to flee the race for a forested area.
The Ertzains finally reached one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hachis they transported and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hachis loads, so they moved to police units for a thorough and heavy drug inspection.
In addition, the officials verified that the registration had been "doubled" as it did not coincide with the collection in the documentation of the van, so a public document falsification crime had also been committed to the arrest.
Ertzaintza continues to investigate the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape the course as stated, and determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old detainee, A.A. J., was transferred to police units to conduct the related proceedings and will be available to the court within the next few hours.
Stop the actress Heather Locklear for driving under the effects of any medicine
The actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been detained this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effects of some medication.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her parking lot in Montecito, according to People magazine, a spokesperson for the California road patrol.
The witness has detailed that over 16.30 hours, Locklear "was treading down the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking front and back, and walking back passed several times over his sunglasses".
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who seemed at first not to recognize the actress, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby highway and left the vehicle.
This person was the one who warned emergency services because "he was concerned about Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside his vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"He seemed disoriented," so the agents took him to the drug and alcohol center to test him.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol was discarded from the very first moment, although "according to the officers at first sight, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some drug".
Locklear was arrested as a suspect of driving under the effects of any substance that had not been specified and entered the local prison over 7 p.m. although he was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left a Arizona treatment clinic where she recovered from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Calling the Andalusian federation of IU to assume its powers in the Silva case
The UU and United Left Member Gaspar Llamazares said today that it would be the regional federation of training that should take a decision on the case of the former Council of Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of treating family members.
"I am a very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its powers," Callazares said about the party's action to adopt with which he has so far been conceivable in the Civilian Consistency.
However, the UI leader argued that the need for "transparency" to be present in possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva might have done: "IU has always defended that these kinds of issues have the highest degree of transparency".
In the same line, he stressed that training has "strict ethical codes for all public offices".
'May blood', Garcia's epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci relives the famous rise of the Spanish against the French in May's blood, which is the most ambitious film in his film with about 15 million euros in budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried "to illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, has explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Kim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría in front of a wide list of interpreters.
May's blood, with a metre above two and a half hours, is poured this Friday into the cinematographic rooms, to become a mining for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
Great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci assures us that he has fulfilled this "a dream of childhood", which he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to round a commemorative tape for the second centenary of May 2, which he accepted at all times and when the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budgets which the Community of Madrid has made in its entirety constitute for Garci a "single opportunity" to environment with decorations and appropriate clothing the portrait of "an atolondrada Spain which was wrong to fight for, as the struggle for independence led to a huge delay in the reign of Fernando VII".
But the filmmaker laments that he has not had any funding such as that of Alatriste or Goya's ghosts - more than twice that of the blood of May - so he has not been able to round some scenes in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with which he has collaborated in almost all his career.
For this reason, the director of Return to begin, has influenced what is his usual form of work, the stage with the actors, with whom he usually tries before starting the round and those who do not casting, because he seems to be "humid" and considers that "part of the director's office is to go to the theater and to the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the interpreters who match in the May Blood repeat before their camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate to Oscar on four occasions - one of which he won - Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the May Blood itself, the Seven French Billar Tables and the finally selected, The Blind Tournaments, do not represent a young generation of Spanish film, "that is what must be known", he said.
With this movie, Garci doesn't expect prizes.
"At first you think you're working for succession, then you realize that you're only working for prosperity, and now you agree to make another movie," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the sevilla dancerina Tortola Valencia
A sevilla dancer will honor a sevilla dancer as well.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and mother of Andalusia (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana and when she was three years old she moved to London with her family.
It was a free dance dancer and specialist in Oriental dances.
He had a passionate life, a pioneer of the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corse that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman, who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe from between wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character and it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to count his life but to collect his spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested me flames of flamenco.
So "the dance of the butterfly" suggested me a guajira, or "the dance of the serpent" some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my dance is also within this aesthetic," she says.
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: the one by Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, as he did in the one by "The Open Door"; and with the Maestro Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with who was his student.
"Matilde makes Tortola the greatest, the character of maturity.
I am happy because I have accepted to act in my work and I feel very honored for it."
The assembly also includes the musical composition and guitars of Jesus Torres and Paco Arríaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the Percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who makes the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were divine in all their extension, and who are always in love with them".
The work also includes in some way the life of this woman who developed in such distant places, especially for the time being, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as across Europe, as she was normally living in London.
"I wanted to remember it because I think it is of those women who have a huge influence at a particular time and now no one knows and much less value their work," Bayón says.
The show will begin today at 20,30 hours at the Lope de Vega theatre.
The publication of the "Newly Married Poet's Journal" also closes the Trienio
The presentation of the first illustrative edition of the "Newest Poet's Diary" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez contracted marriage with Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities programmed by the Andalusian Board's Cultural Council to celebrate the "Trerio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of both.
In this way, the "Zenobia Train and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-editation of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of Nobel, and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That lighthouse", which was inaugurated last May, and which, after travelling through the various Andalusian provinces, will be planned to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
The Andalusian Board of Culture has also acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Newer Poet's Journal", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Anomination of Malice", and gives the idea of the disappearance of American film, and of all America, in front of the impressive idea that Newman has gone.
Look what it took to give him an Oscar.
And it was withdrawn since 2007.
And that he was known to be very sick.
It's still been a mess for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond all expression, and I have now lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to their existence."
No one was afraid to make a joke or to overdo it.
A father of cinema and homeland had died at a particularly dark moment, with fear of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately looking for reasons for dignity.
When it is so hard time and without power the men and very few beings you admire remain, there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
I was incarnate for everyone an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and a defender of lost and gained causes, from the foundation to fight drugs created in honor of his firstborn dead by overdoses to his home and organic food brand.
All a gift to a country that has cost a lot to overcome a suicide food culture.
The expansional wave of Hollywood's admiration neighborhood without paying attention to nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, found that he didn't kill a man but an age.
Another Englishman, poor director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was no more than the top of his career.
The bad boy who came from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has left us a very high list for all," said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dare to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping up the requirement of propriety and having a serious private life and away from cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there is someone who is trying, and Paul Newman is his example.
He was divorced once but then married for 50 years to Joanne Woodward, whom he was faithful when he was probably left with the opportunity not to.
"But why am I going to eat hamburger out of the house, if I have a file inside?" he used to joke.
In heaven he sees the pride that his daughters in the earth match their fans, something that is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, none was as proud as that of a devoted husband, loving father, single grandfather and dedicated philanthropy," they say.
The imperfect career of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that there are Olympics in Madrid and, after the fall of 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's career, I say no!
The perfect race called it, and in my opinion it was the worst career with much that I've been in.
A peak of disproposities that, from then on, if they took it into account as an assessment and I would examine, would be a very clear suspension.
But let's go for parts and from the beginning.
Disposals begin with the collection of the dorsal, which makes you have to go before.
Which doesn't sound bad to me, but if they're already making you go all over it (including the chip to avoid tails in the race).
Not at all.
Here they only made you go to pick up the dorsal (first unproposed, go only for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the shirt (second unproposed, because I need a size XL)
What world do we live in?
Or is it that because of the crisis they have decided to buy only small shirts with less fabric and cheaper?
Well, things like this are a little compared to those in the day of the race.
Apart from having to go very soon to pick up the chip, the queue on arrival is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the bag.
It took more than 35 minutes to wait, something incomprehensible for a career where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as was expected, the race began and we had not yet left the backpack, although once achieved, the collection was worse.
In addition, the rain lessened the wait of more than 40 minutes, which was accompanied by contaminants of popular rebellion and attacked the tape.
I think about 500 people will probably have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me will not even show up with the right time in the ranking, because the chip they told me that, I imagine, I didn't mark the output correctly.
From then on, if I was asked about the perfect race, this wouldn't come into my thoughts.
So I think we'll keep dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft Receptionist Search (virtual)
At the Microsoft's Emergency Technologies conference, Microsoft has shown an advance of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of artificial intelligence without much intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks, such as asking for a taxi (or in Microsoft's case, a launcher to move around the company's campus) by listening to what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a facial recognition system, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they wear - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
Also group the present according to the conversation groups.
In the show video the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he's there to visit someone and tells him he'll be there soon.
Everything without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
The company now has better things to focus on, for example in the next version of its operating system, Windows.
Much has been said this week over a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be easier and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the essentials instead of commercial trash loads, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
All one find, considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change of direction is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, as well as the software.
When Google Chrome left the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many have correctly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the hardware and software to be understood.
Do the same function as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
It's true.
It will never disappear but one must think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People are getting less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer only starts to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
For what do half of the applications come on the system serve?
It's less than that.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and is finally an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
The photo of this post I took it in one of Microsoft employees' rest rooms in Redmond, early in the month.
In the refreshing machine a poster asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, by default, a delay was also confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not arrive at the beginning of 2009 but at the end, rather by 2010.
In Microsoft they will surely look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is every day more computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, is going to pass bill.
Le Fabuleus Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried her on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio lit one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de blood', the same as Al Pacino in 'El Padrino' by Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the uniform of the Musculado gay parish.
And if we get to list star appearances, we can go up to the image of that punctuated bigot force that raised weights in a walking circle.
In essence, it is no more than the typical male shirt from inside in cotton, ash and without sleeves.
The 'tank', which calls the speaking angles, but Le Fabuleus Marcel de Bruxelles ranks over all others.
First of all, because of its rebuffing name - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - it has to do with sport because it receives its name, according to legend, from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' highlights others by their excellent cotton, by their unisex cut, by their distinctive shield and by the small Belgian flag (only recognizable) that the most emblematic shirt models wear as a detail on the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm not only focuses on its tank tops.
Also includes college sweatshirts, back boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marine shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Take thought of the comfort underwear.
Though it's a shame to leave them as underwear.
They're too charming.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't care"
His enormous appearance with his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is often but full of vitality.
Sisters Cruz are now taking their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
It has been in Paris in the promotion that Mango is doing at its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Healed and shy, earns in short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have invented for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, as well as attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honour of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day, but at the same time exciting.
What is your new collection for Mango based on this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
My sister and I both love the movie from the 1950s and 1960s; from there we draw many references.
Then I like to miss a city and watch women dress up, how they combine and mix their clothes, I do a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything goes together and they have a lot in common.
When I was little, I liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to sneak into my aunt's wardrobes and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the attraction park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I was dressed.
You know that dancers like to make us our class and test stylisms, to look at us in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when they give you the dress is when you really find the character.
Then everything goes together, that is, with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You've done it not long ago at 30, have you been in crisis?
What's going on?
I feel better than ever, I like 30s.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with less mistakes.
To me, the biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was little and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think of being a mother or not?
Since then, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body asks me for it and, moreover, I want to be a young mother; I don't want to lose it.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son great happiness and educate him with love.
As for the movie, you're hanging out on a few strenghts you rode last year.
That's right, and I'm already looking forward to seeing the light.
I, who am a woman coming from the theater, am very impatient and anxious, all I want for now and of course, cannot be.
I'm looking forward to 'the last hour' and 'Seeking for the tomb of Christ'.
Seeing what they look like...
A few days ago, you started on a gateway with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going up to a model gateway.
She simply called me Naomi Campbell, whom I've known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a beneficial show for her organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes we show - I took two pieces from our collection for Mango - she stayed to collect money for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know that tender heart of Naomi.
They say so many things about her that, I know her, I would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I'm so good at that part that she gets involved.
He asked me to show up for such a noble cause, but if he asked me to make the pin, then too.
To benefit women in the third world, what is needed.
Alcoholic resuscitation drivers shall install the 'alcohol'
The interior wants the driver with three administrative sanctions for alcoholism to be installed on his vehicle with a system that prevents the start of the drunk vehicle, or if he does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and is now included in the annual memory of the State Attorney-General, according to which it is a pilot project with a duration of one year.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver, so he will also receive a road reeducation course.
In the experience, in addition to the Directorate-General for Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for the Safety of Vehicles (FITSA) will participate.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of the reported drivers more than once for driving drunks again catch the car.
The alcohol would avoid it because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in breath and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow up; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected is higher than permitted.
Its cost is more than EUR 1,000 and would run for the penalty.
In this regard, a study conducted in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce offences by up to 65% during the first year of implementation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save 115 people every year.
The measure is subject to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address these behaviours before they arise in criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, as legal reform can be done by regular means, and however, the necessary reform by criminal means requires a reform of an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial way, although it has already been experimentally installed in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote tomorrow on an initiative by the OSCE which proposes to install this system on school buses, as has been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
At 5:40 p.m., the scheduled time for the program landed at the Presidential Hangar of the airport Benito Juárez de Mexico DF the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Asturias Princes traveled.
The sun was retreating, but its rays were still forced to use the hand as a visa to see the real couple coming down from the plane.
On foot of stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier, I had asked the taxi driver if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very well, then you can't go to the airport to charge at that time... she's from here or so...
- No, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the journey.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar stuck to the red carpet and a military valley made up of 27 Marine soldiers who interpret the salvation of honors.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the Princess, is very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps they had told her that in the DF was threatening storm.
They give a smile and a smile to the photographers before going to the room where the official committee is waiting.
At the hotel door, one of the four largest in the city, they are hosted by a reporter from the Mexican television station.
The best-equipped fashion prize
Perhaps there is no place in the world most suitable to present a fashion award, that Paris and possibly no more exquisite and good-looking live a living designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Boton-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of the new fashion talents.
It is awarded a €300,000 prize.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his designs in the escape of Mango in the number 54 of the Bulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried out for emotion.
By the way, it is the second largest firm in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square metres of surface.
The first one is in London.
So many events, coupled with the desire to thank the designer Valentino who presided over the jury, made us end up at a luxury dinner in the Paris Opera Garnier.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the Presidential Gala table prepared by Mango, shines even more spectacular.
Nati, with her heart broken and making triples of heart, for her brother's recent death, put on a suit of the House and ELAH addresses, which cut breath, and the arm of his son Luis - a canon nearly two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the chair of his dinner of honor.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is so gentleman that he ended up beside Rotchil's bar, without a jacket, because they had been lent to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who came to the shop with pants and shirts - of her own design - and for dinner she was transformed into a long black sexy dress, was excited when on the night walk by the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were taught the ballet test room and she, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a hideout of 'big pile'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the walk through the palace dependencies, but before he showed us on his son's mobile phone pictures.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the view with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another cannon that moves on the bike - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having asked in advance, that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There is no 1000 but 1000 more a way to forget the chaotic and frenetic daily life.
And by the way, they are all gathered in a book that will bring relief to the bookstores on September 30.
The Awakener almost punishes when it sounds every morning at 7:00 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine wrapped up in the agitated rhythm that imposes the present life.
The office is called stress and the back pain computer.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and problems of disconnection with the labour world.
No, the number goes up, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers on the pages of a book an entire 'menu' of possibilities adapted to each taste and minutes of each.
The work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the libraries of the editorial Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone thinks that it is not possible to achieve peace in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' disproves such belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as contacting nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, disconnect the mind and concentrate on reading.
Talk Sleepy
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean these people who wake up so badly telling us something that happened the previous day, but children who talk are sleeping.
The first time that happens to the best you take a joke, but it doesn't really matter.
It is a benign change in the dream that is called dreamy.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one of them told you he spoke at night.
This phenomenon may appear in a very sporadic way (once in life for example associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a monthS...), the child does not remember anything the next day.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
It is often related to other sleep changes such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (dwelling on floor) or sonambulism, but it has no reason to do so.
As mentioned earlier, they may also be associated with very high fever, stress or overexcited situations.
Anyway, it's a not studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
It can be spoken in a tone of quiet voice, loose words, a whisper or all the other way (grits, rumors, long speeches...).
In cases where the event is very intense, it is appropriate to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check if there is any question that is causing much anxiety and gives him an exit in this way.
We have said that it is a benign change, so it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another change in the dream that can be treated (e.g. if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress picture).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child much before going to bed.
So find quiet games and avoid TV programs or series that are fearsome or a little violent.
With very nervous children and it costs them a lot to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire a certain inner calm.
This will help the child to have a more relaxed dream.
Once the dreams appear trying to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day you won't remember anything about what happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because he's unconscious, and you'll break his dream.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you show a lot of anxiety during several episodes, you should consult or find out what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common), do not fall into the temptation to interrogate him to sound information.
You won't get anything, because when you're asleep, you're not aware of how to organize your thinking.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say, with which you are very careful about how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can ask him at night to know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That's causing a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
They'll finally get used to it!
The football club, Isllhaeusern, finally found the way of victory in its field after a long period of poverty.
Without having made a good match, the team created many goals and was able to make a goal to win the match.
The pace was not very constant during this meeting in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann to tear down the squad with a shot away, Illhaeusern quaasi was going to take the "power" and by turns Fonderflick away, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of the foot or also Diebold came to prevent the defense of Dannemarie.
In front, we didn't let the middle camper pass and we just left Riahi in a position of attack.
The beginning of the second time was crucial, first with two times of Riahi and Temporale goal for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the marker for the Illhausiens with the goal of Marais, well located to collect the ball rejected in a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the Illouisiens can't enjoy their happiness for a long time and will be forced to return to the vaults a dozen minutes later and thus leave their teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the occasion and it will not be a problem for the eleven illustians who have retreated a little to "press" their defense, except in the last seconds of the game during which, after an important fart, the balloon passed very close to the cross field.
Sarkozy finds angry fishermen
Before going off to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will run around Britain.
Faced with the demonstration of resistance by fishermen who severely disturbed the entrances of several British and Norman ports last Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go on Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in Finistère, to meet his representatives there.
They promised to welcome him " with a constructive spirit " and expect " to come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the General Board of the " Crisis Committee " established by British fishermen to take action to address the increase in gas prices, which marks a record of the EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the spokesperson for Elisha David Martinon, the president " will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies to be competitive again and to save the conditions of employment and pay for sailors " .
Fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand firm.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce traffic in Morbihan and Calvados, which have resulted in almost 10 km peaks.
The sport port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-Île have not been stopped.
"A filter barrier " has been placed on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday by burning, at the dawn of the alba, pneumatics and wooden pallets in front of the Brest and Lorient fuel warehouses, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Mancha, such as Les Sables d'Olonne, Vandea, where the buses stayed in the port, or in Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantic region, stopped in the afternoon the closure of the important Donges Total refinery.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer fishermen decided to wait until this Wednesday's meeting that will take place in the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting planned in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some British fishermen do not want to be represented by representatives of the national fisheries committee, which did not support their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " fishermen did not leave " and " do not want to move to Paris " , for example, announced Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on petrol, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but consider that the financial balance of a ship can be reached only with a gas oil at a price of less than EUR 0,30 per litre.
The magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of " Two men and a destiny " has died of cancer at 83 years of age in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes also welcomed the legend of the film and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian airline has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession in the global economy.
The world's fourth aircraft builder, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 gears delivered, Embraer's president, Fredrico Fleury Curado, confirmed.
During the first semester, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian builder relies heavily on the Chinese market in particular for the sale of aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 appliances to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would like to sell more than 15 % of its assets
The American International Group, which has been obtained from the American monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15 per cent of its assets in order to repay its loan of $85 billion, according to the Financial Times Sunday.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States, which is specified in this journal.
The AIG Management Board met last Sunday afternoon to consider possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of which AIG intends to be separated include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the Transatlantic Holdings insurer as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the Financial Times.
No final decision has been taken on these sales, follow the Financial Times.
AIG must quickly implement liquidity in order to repay its loan of 85 billion that the Federal Reserve granted to it at risk of seeing the American authorities take 80 % of its capital, diluting it with the appropriate proportion among the current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange charged a historic fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save the banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98 per cent, or a loss ever seen in the Stock of nearly 800 points, and Nasdaq lost 9.14 per cent.
The industrial index Dow Jones fell from 777.68 to 10.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most important fall in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on 17 September 2001, or the day the exchanges began again after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, a technologically dominant, returned 199,61 points to 1,983,73 units and the expanded index (extended) Standard & Poor's 500 to 8.81 % (i.e. 106,85 points), to 1,106.55 units, according to the final figures of the closure.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save the banks that would have been able to regain some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the representatives denied the US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
About two Republicans of each three rejected their plan.
"This is not a good signal sent to the market, which the Congress is unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of the FTN Financial.
"This shows the extent to which the market was counting on this plan," added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within a few days would arrive "too late".
" If the project is really dying (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take the lead (the U.S. central bank, the Network N.) to manage the crisis, which would put more pressure on credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, head of Economics and Finance of the Global Insight.
And by accentuating the sense of urgency, " every day that passes, a financial institution is announced " in the United States, Ms. Piegza stressed.
After the breakup of Washington Mutual last Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Watchovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated dramatically, causing emergency interventions in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that the markets are facing "not only a crisis in the United States but a global crisis", said FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen dramatically.
The 10-year-old treasure bonus yield was 3,632 %, compared to 3,827 % on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year-old bonus was 4,161 %, compared to 4,357 % on Tuesday.
Obama, winner during the first television duel
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House happened to find out who won between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Surprisingly, the republican and democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory on this television duo that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honorable, was not "bright enough" to allow him to slow down in the polls at five weeks of presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Saturday, gives five points of advantage for Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), judges that it is the Democrat who did well.
Among the indecisive voters, who count, Obama won 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them gave McCain the victory, according to a CBS survey.
Obama could confirm its advantage on Thursday with the expected good performance of its member of his own candidacy, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
" It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
He's got good instincts," but I'm avoiding Bill Clinton this weekend.
The September McCain highlighted his indisputable experience in foreign policy, stressing the "ingenuity" of his opponent about these issues that were in the heart of this first scarcity.
" Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that... "he accused several times.
" I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and the knowledge needed to be president," he also assured.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television advertising.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Not to be confused, it was clear and precise.
It highlighted its ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
" McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done so," he said, this weekend, a democratic television advertising that reproached the Republican for not considering the impact of the crisis on the United States. "
" During the ninety-nine minutes of debate, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama reported yesterday, in front of 20,000 people who had met for an election meeting in North Carolina under a rain.
He did not pronounce the words "media class" or "workers". "The financial defeat clearly favors Obama, which is considered by the Americans as the most capable person to save the economy that is at the edge of the precipitation.
"The next week could be a decisive episode," he said, yesterday, the influential and democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama ' s " good economic instincts " with Bill Clinton ' s during the financial crisis in 1998.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster " is the final consequence of eight years of a poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain " .
Reaffirming that despite all the reduction in US taxes of 95 per cent in spite of Wall Street's jumps, the Illinois Senator also noted that the realization of the country's potential energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy was its first priority, with the creation of a security and health system.
McCain wants to build a 45 nuclear power station park from here in 2030.
Predentes, the two candidates have overlooked issues relating to the $700 billion financial rescue plan (EUR 470 billion) adopted yesterday afternoon by the Congress and extremely unpopular.
"In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents protested last Sunday afternoon at the main square of the Belarusian capital to anticipate rejection of the results of the legislation.
Hundreds of Belarusians gathered on Sunday afternoon from the closing of electoral centres in central Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against President Alexandre Loukachenko's power: " the dictator must give up " .
Some people admit that they have not voted: "Why, because they will do what they want with my vote," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has put foreign observers at ease in order to renew contact with the European Union is ready to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean for observers.
They didn't follow the opposition.
" We have been placed next to the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the vote count," said Iouri Potemkine, the spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regroup of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change, underlined by Alexandre Milinkievitch, the former candidate for the opposition to the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our home, is the executive power.
If some Members of the opposition enter Parliament, it is because they will have been appointed but not elected.
" But their entry to parliament can mean television appearances, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. "
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has a lot of debts to Russia, is in crisis, and if we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protector of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process does not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stressed that the number of participants appeared to be too high, and that the generalization of the vote with anticipation (26% of the voters in Minsk) promoted manipulations.
" Have you noticed the elections? Ask the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five Members of the opposition to parliament, who are better suited to power. "
The silence of the night returns again to the square of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission are pleased with their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday its 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Hema-Québec has become one of the world's safest and most effective blood suppliers.
And above all, he regained the confidence of the public, which had been seriously weakened by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and the public's discontent, the Government of Canada made a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, who wanted to clarify the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would not happen again.
While Judge Krever was delaying his relationship, certain provinces then set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this mission.
As a result of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to provide all other provinces and both territories.
" In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, almost 38 per cent of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
After much effort has been made to improve the safety of blood products and much work during the years that followed, we have regained the confidence of the public " , he says before proudly claiming that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population had confidence in the subsequent confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, recalls that " confidence is something extremely fragile " .
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we attended in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of the mad cow disease, a new variant of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, account of Decary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
So we support one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we do not know it and when a serious disease can emerge from it, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we introduce exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had remained in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
But some years ago, it has been shown beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle applied had meaning."
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: nuclear acid tests that enable donors to directly detect the presence of the virus and not the presence of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used so far were based.
Nuclear acid tests allowed the period between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period within a period of less than one week.
We thus substantially reduce the risk of certain donors being infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one person every 12 million is at risk of receiving blood contaminated by HIV.
"That means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
Thus, since Hema-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500,000 blood products each year, more than 24 years will pass before a case of HIV transmission occurs through a blood product.
I think it is possible today to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health without concern," says Hema-Québec head.
" Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion that, for example, the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
Hema-Québec must also provide for sufficient supplies in addition to a secure supply.
" The needs are increasing because the population is ageing.
Since more aggressive anti-cancer treatments often require injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors, which in the medium term regroups only 3 per cent of Quebecis eligible for blood donation. "
All persons with good health, aged 18 years and who meet the eligibility criteria, however, may give blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On the average, 14% of those who propose their blood are not accepted because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they travelled in a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory covering the needs of hospitals.
Punctuality is very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this network of donors as they age and are no longer able to give their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but especially to hold them back and encourage them to be regular donors.
Since the present life is very relaxed, we rarely find time to spend an hour to give your blood," laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone inerts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that are almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank of the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was previously considered biomedical waste is filled with a rich blood of mother cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
" We celebrated a few weeks ago, the placing in the bank of our thousandth blood sample of the umbilical cord and is expected to extract more than a thousand of these per year.
We should start to propose it for insertions at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary who describes this program of cord blood taking as very popular.
" Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot enjoy this, " since Hema-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softball - The Impact on Semifinals
The impact of Montreal was qualified for the semi-finals of the elimination series of the first USL division, thanks to a win of 3-1 (4-3 in final summary) on the coast of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the final room series, at the Saputo Stadium.
Central Campist Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time without a goal on any side, the middle camper David Texto and Rocco Plancentino created many occasions of goal.
Roger Levesque was the only one who let Matt Jordan down for the Sounders.
We remember that during the first game of the series of games going and going, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a defeat for 2-1 in Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the Seattle suburb.
The impact will be measured on the Whitecaps of Vancouver in semifinal.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, Thunder lost 3-1 in the return party to take it for 4-3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless entered the semifinals for 5-4.
The Impact should face Whitecaps next Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief – The victorious goal of Kovalev
The third number one Canadian is willing to start the season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack on a Canadian gain of 3-2 free shot barriers against Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two aids, and Kovalev collected a pass in this gain, the Tricolor room in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, I'm preventing Russian.
"I need another party to feel comfortable."
He tried to play the most at first, notes Guido Carbonneau.
But I think you appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice ovation."
Charest deals with the North
The prime minister does not exclude the holding of elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general board of the Liberal Party ends, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tried to elect during today's partial election.
To reject the limits of our last great northern border ": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force staying on the main lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
In three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric packaging, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means such as during the electoral period.
The prime minister thinks that the elections will take place this autumn, although he made it clear that his schedule was very full.
The " North Plan " is the fourth side of a " vision" that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, the " new economic space " , which includes an agreement on the working hand with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister was nevertheless limited to explaining why the North was " a jewel to immense potential " , but he did not give a term, investment amounts , or precise priority in future projects.
What could be more developed above all is: in particular hydroelectricity, forest, but above all the mining sector, affected by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " nickel, five, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and diamond " , according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as large as France", "is our home, is in Quebec.
Not only is it our home, but it is in us," he insisted, as to show that he was asking for a national founding myth.
Quebec was built much thanks to its relationship with the North, stressed: the laugh towards gold in Abitib, the Quebec engineering, the James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it is our future," he added, after having taken a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of the Labrador that Quebec has always reclaimed, said the prime minister during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion is presented, I repeat that government side position," he said.
In addition, "with climate change, we have to reconsider our North vision," he said, speaking of the northwest pass, which will be opened every year due to the founding of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létoureau (former member of the Quebec Party of Ungava), have already started consultations with about thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) played an important role started some work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " , but a meeting in which " a common vision will be given " .
Northern development would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan " will be concerted, ordered and respectful of the environment " , he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the first liberal ministers who preceded him.
" Like the Liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development. "
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival to the party's power.
One of the resolutions adopted is to re-establish the Central Beauharnois in Embalse Adélard-Godbout.
"By Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage that made the Revolution quiet and nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Burrassa that made Bahia James our party supposed to forge the future," said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he called another reference, that conservative, John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
On the subject of the project for Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric embalming, Mr. Charest stressed that its deployment is scheduled for 2012.
"This is between us, but I expect to be there," he entrusted his militants, shouting applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and no doubt not in 2009, did not dismiss the possibility of holding a vote this autumn, which the law allows.
It underlines that its schedule is nevertheless full, particularly because of a mission from the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " which had no problem accepting: the Liberal Party of Quebec in particular claimed recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
He also wished Quebec to name members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcome the great lines of the North Plan with skepticism.
The head of the Quebec Party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the North Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If I had, "we would have made progress today," said Mrs. Marois next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote today), Françoise Mercure.
Quebec's Democratic Action seemed to support the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
"But what you wish is that this is not just a show," said leader Sebastian Proulx, in place of Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonest Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (oh irony!) at Harper's office, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "glorious" for Canada.
To disgrace this woman who has taken an incessant fight for justice and deserves all our admiration what she says about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are facing a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national that is locked up in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that are against him occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and leaves a child-soldier to live in inhuman conditions.
The only one who is dealing with a false justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
We recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to enjoy the benefit of an equitable process in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes on torture: it does not care that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of exacerbations.
We still do not realize that, but at this moment we have witnessed an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that makes no sense.
The time has come when there is no morale anymore: we can abuse, torture, arbitrarily incarcerate a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far as he wants to be a minority (what will happen after October 14th?).
Many electors believe that they will find salvation in a party that commends Virtud, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has given up what the reputation and dignity of our country was doing.
Mr. Toews is embarrassed by this resignation and nothing else.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian speech
Le Devor published a letter by Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President and Director of the Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the largest auriff company in the world attempted a six million-euro defamation process against three authors and a small editorial house in order to provoke a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of persecution for defamation, but the law.
No surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to cause harm to anyone who dares to maintain a position contrary to his?
The outcome of the dispute is of little importance, the authors and editors of the book Noir Canada should spend considerable amounts in order to prepare their defense and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the pockets almost without the bottom of the mine.
The tactics, in these unequal struggles, often consist of ruining the defendants in order to impose a friendly arrangement that will dampen opposition as well as frighten anyone to reconsider the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public opinion that he would have had to present his vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is being done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, the discussions in Canada are usually done by changing ideas and not by beatings.
It was sufficient, therefore, for the mine to open its books, records and establish a real debate through newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to rely on public opinion and reject requests and letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr Garver possibly explain how he could ask for a "public" debate, ignoring his views?
According to the vice-president, this word seems to refer only to highly paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; it represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or what you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does it primarily because it rejects the brutal way of the mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but as a basis for civilized change in arguments, and not as a result of what many people perceive as a persecution-torture (following the " public debate " , Barrick Gold has just filed a claim with the authors of Noir Canada encouraging them to stop using this word).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on freedom of university and truth, essential for all democratic societies.
He denied the right to cite credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations, which represented the basis for intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease this world’s wealthy companies in a country like Canada, under much persecution, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disputes and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's relentless persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he claims, he does not want to have a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to place devices that limit this kind of abuse.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and Congressional leaders, at the same time Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan aimed at halting the financial crisis that shook Wall Street for months still needs to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for better control by the electors of their implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of invested public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses covered by the lack of payment, as well as a right to control the salaries paid to the managers of the exempted companies.
The American Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
" We have made great progress with a view to an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush Administration representative Henry Paulson.
" Everything has been done to cover the regular economy and Americans in the face of the current Wall Street crisis," the democrat explained.
"This is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, traumatism, chaos and disturbances on the daily lives of Americans will be huge," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they were afraid of the effect that would result in a new failure in the humour of investors.
The last time they set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the US presidential elections, who have joined the negotiations late, were more favourable to the agreement, but did not forget to express their discontent that they were forced to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was entrusted with certain provisions to reach the agreement, in particular which would allow owners to keep their home and the salary of the heads of state-surviving companies.
" When contributors are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no need to be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, questioned in another chain to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it."
" The important points I have read [show] that it is something we will have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
He said that the option of not doing anything is not acceptable."
The 700 billion-dollar plan aims to buy with the taxpayers' money the suspicious debts, the assets to the risks and indemnities of the American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the outbreak of a real estate bubble that first led to the sinking of risk mortgage credits before extending to other more common forms of credit securities (CCAA) and resulting in a freezing of liquidity and a discharge from banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of elected Republicans who had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe that we have left the stagnation since the Democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of the companies in difficulty are only secured by the government, rather than purchased.
With the aim of eliminating expectations for everyone at Congress, we also added a provision that provided that if the government had to assume losses for five years with this program, it could impose new rates that would help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which 100 million more can be added if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote by Congress.
In exchange for your help, Washington will get participation in the rescue companies that will give you dividends in the event of profits and that will be able to sell again when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying the embargo procedures concerning housing obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as setting limits on remuneration and on the metallic compensation paid to business leaders affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see him put to the vote of the House of Representatives from today and that of the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all his efforts, he is still not sure that his plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest against this project yesterday, both from Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the chamber's finance commission, said to his voters that "with all the evidence, Washington doesn't want to understand " .
" We have a very serious financial problem.
There are some solutions.
But not the one that consists of taking advantage of the contributors."
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is encouraging to a small group in Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred professors of economics, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote us to tell us: we ask Congress not to rush and examine carefully the route to be taken," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we again had the proof of the global nature of the crisis.
Following an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that he had refused to buy his competitor in bankruptcy since he lost $2 billion (US$2.9 billion) during the crisis of real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
Instead, we regain a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It is just something that savers and families will now appreciate that times are uncertain."
During this time, on the other hand, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would charge all outstanding loans to Bradford and Bringley and more than €41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
His blue eyes thus represented his triumph.
Did the American actor with a lovely smile ever get rid of his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
Their smell, their sensitivity and a talent that was obvious will also have removed it from the register of power that have the true sacred monsters.
But what a great background runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, at 83 years of age, because of lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American film in the past years.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, who seemed to be much and who was long considered a rival in the film, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breaking up of the dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes magnificent children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots one of the glorious faces of the American dream will be born.
No unscrupulous ego, last quality mark.
Because in him was projected a whole country in love with the self-made man, the combatant of the Pacific War, wounded in battle, who at the beginning of the 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theater, on television and soon on film.
This man who fought for civil rights was also the car driver who was ranked in second place at the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a six symbol, although member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star also disappear with him, allergic to the scandals of the world of the show that we do not know very well.
He is an honest man, in the most noble sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman caused the turning point to the filmmakers this weekend, while their great roles in the black screen of the memories are intertwined.
More than a half century of the seventh American art in perpetual change parades through it.
Many memories come back to memory as the cowboy with the charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Cata on the adapted zinc roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we call to your sensitive Mr Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone to the history of the film.
This Rocky Grazian, criminal, tortured, violent, unforgettable boxer at Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by Hate), Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, repeated after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This nice mangament in the sustuoso film The Sting (El Hitpe), Oscar to the best film in 1973.
A bitter biller and salesman in Robert Rossen's great film The Husterer (1961), will repeat the character in The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, who won his only Oscar among nine nominations in 1987.
This face that changes over the years, it was him.
Still him.
Times change during their career.
Young people know him especially thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a hockey team on little orthodox ice.
His fans saw him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a last role as patron of the Irish mob in the Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the rice was risked.
Contrary to several movie legends that soon left the race, Newman stayed a lot in the world of the movie, reporting Hollywood, his gold, his fasts and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, "as a challenge that lives in " the underplaying " and that judges his performances too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers arrived for a long time without doing anything.
However, he less often interpreted the role of young galan than of marginal: neurotics, alcoholics, cabrons or desperate ones, whose features reflected the rebellions.
As a performer, Newman later revealed his true pudic sensitivity not very well known.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward on the lead, described a female melancholy portrait.
He lost his son Scott because of overdoses dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of horror and sadness.
" Among the many honours that were set up yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former weapons partner Robert Redford (they had worked together at The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, deeply saddened: " My life and my country were better thanks to their existence "
Generosity, love of existence are important features of the deceased actor.
On the other hand, there is also a great campaigner for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester against Hollywood's excesses.
We'll have seen a lot of his face reigning over the bowls of vinegar sauce, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a bad taste method, although it started as a gag.
The benefits of these sales were given to your Childhood Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, rather than being content with his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of an American artist so lucid and so generous.
In summary, a model citizen.
What did they produce in the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory?
Very soon, on 8 October, the criminal trial against János Zuschlag and his colleagues will begin.
Politicians and their partners are accused of committing significant damage, in a business way, continuously and in an organized manner, in addition to other crimes, including falsification of documents.
According to the Office, funds obtained in public tenders were used for their own purposes, justifying on many occasions the performance of tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and the city councils - in total some 65 million HUFs - partly stopped in the treasury of the Fiatal Balldal organization and partly in the pocket of individuals.
The method, which was also made known by the researchers, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public tenders with false invoices after which there was no real execution, the various associations had never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the charge, most of the invoices were false.
To this end, the Talonaries were obtained on the market in the District of Józsefváros and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kisunhalas.
And the question of which company was to carry out the falsified invoice was decided amongst others on that tour by the Upper Balatón Region where János Zuschlag sent to István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he should choose hostels and restaurants.
He requested invoices for his consumption and they served as a model for making invoices that were presented, among other things, in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, as well as in the Capital City.
These invoices were signed in most of them by István Lados and his colleague András 周ri, who, according to our information, wrote the reports needed to obtain the public subsidies.
During one of his "student trips" Lados chose a beer shop.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and its companions, this gastronomic centre provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the manager of the center - so many people do not match in that place.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Job Jöv~ért Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik Évért - was full of formal and contextual errors.
Because a hostel in Badacsonytomaj town had only three rooms and more than ten people couldn't stay there in one night, but in the invoice there were one hundred and thirty people.
But the manufacturers of big fancy invoices also exaggerated when they pointed to the gastronomic center Pigal Kft. because in the book holding of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor - there were no documents on behalf of Jobb Jöv Õért and Hoppá.
The manager of the company, Gyvg.hu, informed him that when he was quoted by the prosecutor and showed him the invoices, he knew it was false documents.
"In the seal the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: In addition to the formal problems, he also did not agree that according to the invoice, a hundred people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms in which there are not so many people.
In addition, there were also food included in the invoice, while the restaurant has been out of operation for a long time.
Enthusiast invoice manufacturers were also not informed that the travel agency elected in Budapest organizes trips exclusively abroad, so that in the cash bill they foolishly indicated as service a trip within Hungary, which also did not coincide with the agency's bill delivery practice.
In addition, as was known during the investigation, VAT was included in the document, even though travel outside the European Union was tax-free.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the Jobb JövÕért Foundation, since the services of the company are not loaded with 25 but only by 15 percent of VAT, and the hotel employees only extended invoices made to the machine, however the invoice was manual.
In addition, "senders" made other errors, as in the case of a company in which they put in the invoice as an activity carried out the road transport to which – known during the investigations of the prosecutor – the company founded as an investment consultant does not carry out.
Also due to formal differences - inadequate invoice format, false stamps are supposed to be false invoices sent to Együtt to Harmadik Évérdért Alapítvány, for XXI. Századi Kulturáílis Egyesület and for Biztos Pont.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehérto Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue such invoices.
The falsifiers also failed to note that when the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in the process of liquidation, that is why the liquidator - according to our information - refused to issue such a document.
The invoices were sent out consciously
Another group of false invoice manufacturers are those who were aware that they should send fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapest Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Balldal - Ifju Socialisták, issued an invoice worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Együtt Foundation at Harmadik Évérdért.
The manager of the Collab Kft. - According to the charge, one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, convinced him to send fictitious invoices.
He also collaborated with Zuschlag and his associates the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation process, which in 2003 provided invoices of approximately five million HUF to the Jobb JövÕért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlas Egyesület Association and the Vörösfeny-Egyesület Association, without real economic activity behind.
There was no movement of capital either, as they later cancelled the invoices prepared but forgot to make it appear in their documents to this entity.
The following group of false invoice manufacturers includes those who have some connection with the accused.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the head of the Ukrainian managing director of the Delta Trio SL with a fictitious headquarters in Budapest, which dealt with fuel and vehicle trade.
This company issued numerous invoices for a value of approximately 18 million HUF in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer resources.
According to the research data, these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kisunhalas, which has been in liquidation process since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also sent documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he sent invoices on behalf of the company for Atlas, for Hoppa and for Együtt to Harmadik Ávredért Alapítvány charging the amount himself.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian Albanians at Ivan Kubatov's express request.
However, none of the companies actually worked properly - according to the accused - to whom they did not receive employment.
But he benefited from these companies, since at the request of his colleague, lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company's registration documents, issued invoices on behalf of the companies for Zuschlag-related organizations: for Atlas and for the Y-Generation.
Kubatov, on behalf of Cash Investment, the Trió Delta, the Fa-Bani Jos, the Jos Investment and the Linaxtrade, gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor considered Kubatov to receive VAT and 10% of the amount of invoices.
This man even took advantage of the company in command Szi-Beri to send fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generation and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországért presented a competition in January 2006 to Tancsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
Of the tender they obtained 500 000 HUF respectively, but they did not use the money for the objectives of the competition.
To prevent this from being discovered, they presented to the TMA five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that Arpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the accused will probably report in the trial - as they did in the Prosecutor's Office - the course of falsification of invoices.
The most interesting thing can be the confession of the chief accuser János Zuschlag, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to speak of everything, this has not done so far.
The question is: what interest does it have?, because perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - 50 million HUF - the Socialists reached an agreement with him so that Zusi would assume all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days even could offend him, since to relieve his prison conditions he applied for house arrest, but he was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous authors of very high-value economic crimes, who have never returned the money, walk freely or can at least wait in their own home for the sentence, he has no chance of that.
Psychology of the answers: Why do we spend more money?
The participants in the auctions are willing to spend more money and overestimate the product.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York discovered the neurological - economic bases of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study published in Science magazine, people don't want to lose in skills such as eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists have tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" by means of experimental substations.
One of the volunteer groups played lottery, the other participated in a auction and as long as it was being examined through the functional magnetic resonance system (fMRI) active areas of the brain of the participants in the experiment.
In both games the participants could earn money, but during the auctions, where it is a fundamental element to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the operation of the complex called strata located below the brain cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "auto premium" mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention against causing an intense reaction of the stratum.
In order to base their theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment, three groups voted against one person under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product in question, and its members were betting.
Another group was also promised that if they won, they would receive $15 more.
On the other hand, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in the event of the loss of the auction, the members of the group lost even that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, checking the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the group that played "against failure" were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the "winner" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
So those so far explained the phenomena of the auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so that we now arrive at a third explanation" - established Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should you go to your doctor?
In the world some five hundred million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the main causes of death.
The number of infections in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated because many of the sick do not know they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is the common name of different liver diseases caused by the virus.
Symptoms appear to be very common; liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are very different.
Hepatitis virus depending on the pathogen agent is spread through two main forms: hepatitis A and E via food (e.g. with water or contaminated food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body moods (sperm, vaginal humour, saliva).
It is recommended for travellers to be protected by a virus A and B vaccine, there are no vaccines against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after consuming the infected food, it is manifested by a general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After this appears in the skin and in the white of the eyes the jaundice, the excrement becomes clear, dark urine and healing can last even two to three weeks.
Each year, one million people die from cancer in the world and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to estimates, only one in ten people receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can produce liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most people don't know that you're sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys the liver cells and often the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Therefore, early recognition, systematic medical control, is very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently there are about 200 million people in the world suffering from chronic hepatitis C.
Since this disease can also be detected with routine laboratory control, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when experiencing some unknown symptoms.
The disease has healing if it is discovered in time, it is possible to eradicate the virus from the body, so it can be removed from the infection and prevent cancer.
It was the World Hepatitis Day on 30 September, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by the virus and to the importance of its early recognition.
Does it hurt less those who believe in God?
According to a recent study, religious faith has a calming effect that also alleviated the death of martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed how religious belief influences human pain - reported the British newspaper Telegraph.
In the framework of this unique experiment, they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and to the same number of atheists, while everyone was looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the scanning technique of the human brain, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first of the series of studies in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the various departments of the University also participate alongside academics.
The analysis took place the following way; they set a chissing instrument at the left hand of the patient, which applied the electrical shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at it in two paintings; the Virgin Mary, the work of the 17th century Sassoferrato and the Lady of the Armor of Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century.
The researchers had the hope that the Virgin Mary's show would cause a certain religious spirit among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it had a calming effect.
Patients spent half an hour in an MRI scan, receiving 20 electric shocks in four successive parts during that period while observing the painting of the religious theme or the other.
Catholics claimed that when they looked at the Virgin Mary they felt in "security" as "protected", "they were calm and in their hearts peace reigned."
When they observed the picture of the religious theme, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any such impacting image you can achieve a similar effect with atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person who feels very positive, like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright celebrated the outcome of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases really change our personality" - added Wright.
After these great results, there is only one question: what effect would it have on the pain regulation if the faithful Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of her size were shown?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary cast even better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
In his tenth birthday Google can say: you can find it both in the people's pocket and in the sky above his head; you know where his holidays were, what doctors visit and what interests them.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, this is not enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who make a parallel with the Orwelian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated to the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to gather as many personal data as possible on its users, and this is necessary in order to meet the original goals of Google’s founders: “We gather in a system all the world’s information!”.
According to Google's leader, the company even after ten years of work that it turned over to the World is still in the initial phase of the effort to be able to process all the information.
To the question that is going to happen within five years Schmidt answered this way: I wish Google could answer questions like "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the best job I would like?" - however, software will not be able to answer questions that seem so simple while there is not enough information for users.
Not all netizens are aware that during their navigation on the Network, the searched keywords, IP addresses and pages are stored precisely when the search was completed.
For example, thanks to Personalized Search that started two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can consult again what they were looking for before, which they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - in this same logic the Recommendations will be based, on which the system will offer us products and services based on previously defined and stored preferences.
What will happen if they take advantage of my data against me, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who are concerned by seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases, the potential represented by the company is what can be fearsome and not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is already confirmed that they not only preserve, but also give to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of internet users.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google gave the Brazilian government the information on its web page, called Orkut, to identify pedophiles.
On the other hand, netizens concerned about the rights of individuals were relieved in May when the company together with the EFF, an organization for the defence of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated to the court that it was right in its dispute with the FBI: according to the judgment, Google cannot be forced, through any of the constitutional points, to provide any kind of information requested by the FBI in secret.
(At the same time, the federal government has achieved its pretext of strengthening the child protection law passed years ago, about fifty thousand Web addresses and some thousand search phrases, but without getting the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of web pages and keywords for the last two months.)
This is quite contradictory the opinion about Google: those who fear to provide their personal data are critical because they think that their privacy, their private life, is damaged when they start using Google's services, and rebel against it as against multinational companies of conservative imagery.
Meanwhile, North American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, Internet users and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "avant-garde corporation", not its rival, Microsoft, catalogued by its Windows as World Conqueror, for many that both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and seems younger, more collaborating than the practice of the official software giant.
But it can also be because the geeks have precisely seen the very problematic relationship between the rights of people and the Internet that has just been produced by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: the Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaborating, leaving targeted footprints behind us and taking advantage of the available channels, and while the measures of these individually vary, the essence remains the same: show us ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on many collective pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, and even join them with other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm that offers list of their music habits, then they can include them in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also have a blog, where the latest photo galleries that are stored automatically appear on Flickr or Picasa.
We can know a number of cases from which the bride, for example, when she sees the flow of photographs of the next morning of the common friends, finds out who had spent the night before her cheating boyfriend or can fire the employee of a company because he writes his honest opinion on his blog about the direction of the company: one thing is sure, the definition of private life has been fully revalued.
The life "on line" of a person is what she shows herself - this is the definition hidden behind the behavior of youth of our days.
And whoever wants to hide something, or at least wants to erase Google's monopoly, can do so (starting with, for example, the Scroogle that uses Google's search system, but does not leave any traces).
There are many people who don't want to register on the collective pages to prevent them from finding them, but you can replace Google's "on-line" applications, from text editing software to image and read news applications with alternative versions that don't connect with giant servers or prepare the most perfect profile on us.
Public opinion expects almost openly the day Google shows his true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($14 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdNose advertising areas threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, while services that are increasingly being introduced cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft but also for many other software developers.
Critic observers, however, will also find the alarming contradictions: for example, the senior management roundly rejected the employees' protest after doubling the company's childcare price, considered too much to the unlimited number of employees' food, but this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google gave in to the pressure of the Chinese government and the company under the agreement filtered all information that violated the good morals and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but that only when it was already ready to work, what if it is certain is that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will be able to address the World: while some believe that the Google Book and Magazine project will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be cited by the United States Supreme Court, others fear your health system, because in it we can create our own complete health profile, with previous analysis, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database can provide a good raw material for science fiction writers, Scroogled, a novel from the popular Cory Doctorow, describes this future in Orwelian form, where only a man of Google's data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped to wipe out the fingerprints of the author of the double murder of the city of Ozd.
The police interrogated two minors about the double murder of Ózd who, according to a well-founded suspicion, helped to wipe out the traces of the crime - said the spokesman of the Public Order Commissioner of the province of Borsod on Tuesday.
The young people recognized the crime they were charged with, and they are currently being accused of crime.
The two minors - according to information from the Hungarian News Agency - can defend themselves freely.
Because of the complexity you can receive up to 5 years of prison.
The accused of the double murder of Ozd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pre-trial detention since Sunday.
He is accused of murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigations it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The accused did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week, he quoted his creditor at the headquarters of a company in Ozd, where he killed him and then also killed the 9-year-old daughter of the victim.
According to ITI, the young man was prepared to commit the crime long before, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden in the crime scene.
The police examine with an expert the weapons and the circumstances of their use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange presented an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - per cent of Prague Stock Exchange shares.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles, even though the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 per cent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State that within a few months wishes to sell 60 per cent of the shares.
The Czech economic journal E15 reported that the Polish offer was the highest among those offered by interested parties in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, so far they have offered the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange said last week that among the new owners concerned the new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not dismiss the possibility that, in the future, the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in approximately 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholder agreement, approximately 90 per cent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Bank of Investment Patria Finance with a participation of approximately 25 percent, followed by the Banco Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European daily comments on Tuesday devoted to the increasingly profound international financial crisis speak of a "second 11 September".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American President - the opinion of the Republic of Rome - the President has not even been able to get his own party's support for the bill made hastily, whose aim is to solve this desperate situation...
Instead of a new Pearl Habor, which was spoken of by Multimillionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to speak of a "second 11 September".
According to part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In the World's view, the mistake of the political direction of the United States was the one that led the world economy to the edge of the abyss.
The danger of demobilization of the North American monetary system is growing and will then affect the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the congress vote, there was a danger that Washington would not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations of the history of capitalism takes place.
You cannot ignore this threat - points out the Geneva Anzeiger Tags.
Some states today can still pull bail belts from the Tambalean financial institutions, thus saving them from the failure of taxpayers' money.
But if more banking is demolished, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be enough.
Long-term control over fragmented financial markets is needed by the Member States of the European Union.
The financial institutions in crisis only received more than EUR 100 billion on Monday - he recalls the Vienna Der Standard, adding that they are increasingly real concerns that, as did the Americans, European taxpayers must also pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has so far not taken seriously the crisis that is going on as a nightmare for the Old Continent .
The "savers" will not have to present at once hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they were to define: in what cases is it justified to use the taxpayer's funds to avoid a greater harm?
The intelligent car imitates the flight of the ape
What would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of existing obstacles sensors in nature?
For example, the one of the apes.
In a surprising project presented at the CEETC in Japan, the abbots gave the starting point for the engineers of Nissan to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the robotic steering system for cars of type BR23C nature simulation, to which the characteristics of the avant-garde were given, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that could exacerbate all collisions.
During the flight each abeyorro creates its own particular oval space that actually looks very much like our safety protective capsule - explained in the Kazuhhiro Doi exhibition, technology director of RP and development and research.
They play an important role in the composite eyes of the beekeepers who are able to see in all directions in an angle above 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the composite eyes, the engineers used the length measurement system for laser beams.
This identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 metres, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor of the vehicle which is immediately turned into a manoeuvre to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the vehicle robot imitating the movements of the abrasives changes direction by rotating the wheels to the necessary extent.
The difference in any existing system at the moment, this maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If it wasn't so, the vehicle robot couldn't react fast enough as to avoid obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the protective safety capsule, within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a blessing is doing to excite other disadvantages.
This process must be carried out in an open and closed eye.
However, unlike the abrasives, the movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, but can only be bidimensionally and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for beekeepers to escape other beekeepers, here they used only as a possibility for the car robot the rotating movement and acceleration plus the braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and greater its energy density, which means they have a longer life than lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, the important is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the data processing capacity, nor much less the storage capacity.
This device must only process some input signals in each second and react as appropriate.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with instinctive logic based on the data of previous maneuvers, so it only uses a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
No gigabytes or megabytes are needed.
This is the first step in developing technology to unravel the obstacles immediately, which according to Nissan's calculations, can be incorporated into series-made models within ten years.
Another possibility for your application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to lead the driver to his destination, avoiding the obstacles that exist on his way.

The written version of the Financial Rescue Package Act of $700 billion has been prepared, which will be applied in several phases with a view to purchasing the bank ' s bad credits.
In the first phase half of the money will be spent.
According to the Eastern Coast hour during the new consultations that lasted until Saturday night, congressional leaders reached an agreement on the financial rescue package of $700 billion in total, after several days of discussion - Reuters reported.
We have made significant progress - said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the North American Congress, saying that there is only a need to formalise the agreement in a document.
The commitment to the package was supported by both candidates for the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, Minister of Finance, speaking of the outcome of the commitment, said: this programme will work and will be efficient but other measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about bringing it back to the car of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. on Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington time (or before 2 p.m. on Monday, according to Central Europe time) without causing a spectacular leap in the bags.
On the draft law called emergency law for the economic stabilization of 2008, the North American Congress will vote first Monday and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush consulted Pelosi on Saturday night and then the White House also celebrated the news about the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made during the night and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy - said Tony Fratto, the spokesperson of the White House.
The programme differs from the original Bush administration proposal to spend all $700 billion to buy low-quality credit fund securities.
Only half of the $700 billion can now be spent, using $250 billion immediately after the Congress votes, probably on Monday, will the Ministry of Finance buy credit, bad-class and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the President's decision.
This programme will be controlled by a special agency, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion could be spent after a new Congress decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined approach: it can simultaneously buy bad credit, mortgages and asset securities, as well as other "poisonable" credit.
The purchase can be made either by bribes or directly - they informed the competent persons of the ministry.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the financial portfolio guarantees the worrying elements by which companies will pay the amount for the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson said: The law thus ensures the necessary financial resources, which can even reach $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the American financial system, is about buying bad financial resources, insurance or risk prevention that could lead to the demobilization of some large financial institutions.
We do all we can to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - added.
On the other hand, the heads of banks who are in a hurry and expect State aid may have the official limitation of their compensation, which the North American Argot simply calls gold parachutes.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, in addition to the limitations depending on the form of assistance from the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys in the framework of a auction, an extra charge will be imposed for gold parachutes, unless the bank's failed boss retires.
By buying bad credit directly, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the compensations of the bosses are not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, there will be no change in existing gold parachute contracts, the restrictions refer only to new contracts to encourage participation in the programme as well.
This is the first case in North American history that will be in place a legal limitation on the income of the Directors-General - Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Congress Committee, commented on this measure.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares of the participating banks in the programme, thus reducing the risk of contributors, since they can ultimately even gain profits from the transaction as soon as the economy is recovered and the bank with it.
According to the draft law in the next five years, the President shall submit to Congress a proposal on how to return the financial sector losses to contributors.
Of course, on both sides there were those who expressed their reservations with respect to the project.
This is not what the US citizens ordered us, that is, the US dollars are not being protected from contributors - said the Republican congressman in California, Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: the measures urged him to be the same as those responsible for demolishing Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
In August 2008, national industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 per cent compared to last month's prices and by 12.9 per cent compared to August 2007 prices - reported the Central Statistical Office (CSB).
Export industrial prices rose by 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent compared to the previous year.
As a result of changes in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent over the previous month and by 3.2 per cent over the previous year.
Industrial sales prices increased only to a minimum, with 0.1 per cent.
The domestic sales prices of the processing industries increased at least by 0.1 per cent compared to July.
The higher price increases occurred in August 2008, in the leather and footwear production sector (2.8 per cent), due primarily to an increase of 4.6 per cent per month in bags and belts and an increase of 2.5 per cent in footwear.
The highest price level of plastic and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical production branch (1.6 per cent).
A price reduction in the petrochemical sector, (1.4 per cent), in the production of electric machinery and instruments (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum extent - in the processing sectors of wood (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
In the rest of the processing industry, there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water, which represent an important weight within domestic trade, an increase of 0.3 per cent was recorded in August, first of all as a result of the increase in official prices from the first of July.
In a comparison of a 12-month period - in domestic sales in the processing industry - the higher price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 per cent).
In the metal manufacture sector, an increase of 13.2 per cent was observed, while in the food, drink and tobacco industry, a decisive weight increase of 11 per cent was observed.
A decrease in prices was recorded in the textile industry (2.5 per cent) as well as in the manufacture of electric machinery and instruments (0.3 per cent).
In the rest of the processing sectors, the rate of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
During the year in the processing industry, prices increased globally by 10.2 per cent.
Electricity prices, gas, heat and water supply exceeded 18.7 per cent of previous year's prices.
In August, among the various domestic trade sectors, the highest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) was recorded in the investment goods sectors.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, in the energy sector and in the intermediate sectors there was no change compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the higher price increases occurred in the energy sectors and in the intermediate industry (16.8%).
A drop of 6.8 per cent was recorded in consumer goods production branches and 1.4 per cent in investment goods.
The export prices of the industry calculated in HUF increased by 1.1 per cent compared to the previous month, and compared to 12 months, there was a decrease of 3.9 per cent.
The rate of our national currency in one month was reduced by 1.7 per cent with respect to the euro and by 7.1 per cent with respect to the dollar, compared to August 2007, it strengthened by 7.5 per cent with respect to the euro and 15.9 per cent with respect to the dollar.
Will next year no longer need visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there are many possibilities for about 12 January to enter into force the US-Hungarian agreement on visa-exemption - the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke of this in Chicago, in front of the Hungarians living there.
In his opinion, "the electronic access and control system is almost entirely dependent on the building in time on the other side of the Atlantic".
At the same time, he warned that in the new system the pre-accession plan would disappear, but tourists should be registered before they leave the country of origin.
From today the head of Hungarian diplomacy holds talks in Washington.
He will be interviewed with the Secretary of State Condolezza Rice by giving him the Median Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and will hold negotiations with international policy advisers from candidates to the presidency, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favour of the bank's financial rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major North American parties, assured their support for the $700 million bank assistance programme on Sunday, but there are politicians demanding the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
The representatives of Congress and Administration, after several days of marathon negotiations, announced on Sunday morning: a principle agreement was reached on the bank's financial rescue package.
The financial package aimed at solving the Wall Street crisis and decoupling the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to demonstrate that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, by putting economic issues first, Obama regained some advantage and disappeared the advantage of McCain that he had gained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin's candidacy to the Vice-President.
In a half-way campaign in Detroit, held last Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion package law.
He stressed that the proposal included those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and with responsibility (...) employment is at risk, you save, as well as entire industries and the stability of the whole economy" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not take advantage of the opportunity to qualify as obsolete McCain's economic concepts.
In an interview given to ABC McCain he explained that "we'll all get this through hard times (...) but not doing anything just isn't a viable way."
The Republican Senator said that the proposal included the establishment of a control committee for the Minister of Fines and the limitation of executive compensation, he insisted on it.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play an important role in the consultations, but he consulted the minister daily.
Congress President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that Congressors are likely to vote on the bill on Monday.
Press magazine of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only within its own group became the most conscious voters - Der Spiegel says about the weak electoral outcome of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a red coalition.
The mirror (spiel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German magazine on the left, Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents" analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known politician, the Erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad two Beckstein-Huber had assumed his office.
Social Christians for several decades were developing Bavaria - and right now these modern citizens are those who give him their back.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, so is Angela Merkel.
The failure was not completely surprising for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that had been foreseen for almost ten years: the indisputable hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago , in 1998 the CSU reached 47.7 per cent , for the first time below 50 per cent since the 1950s .
This was repeated three years ago, in the elections of the Bundestag in 2005, that is, still during the so-called Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernisation of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents .
The sociologists had been predicting this for 40 years, but at the pace they were very wrong. However, secularization, the results of the education and settlement of the North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization also increases opportunities and also has political implications.
The right-wing group is intact, only within its own group have become the most conscious, more critical and more tested voters.
It is surprising that, in recent weeks, the conventional groups of citizens have been the ones who have gone further than the CSU; the autonomouss, the small industrialists, those who have baccillerates and diplomats.
Thus, the support for the CSU was reduced to less than 40 per cent.
The Press (depresse.com)
Vienna's conservative journal: "Who with? In its article entitled "The presidents of the parties are very reserved for coalition issues" - it deals with the confused situation of internal politics after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the EVP.
The EPO prohibits the involvement of the SPO in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is shown to be open in all directions to negotiate, the greens do not yet wish to consult on the coalition.
The elections were already held, and now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the party leaders only let some of their barracks see.
Werner Faymann, President of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the EIA.
SPÖ wants to demonstrate that collaboration between the two parties is possible - it already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left the question pending that if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, in the post of vice-canceller.
He claimed that in any case they rejected Schüssel-Multererer's era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Multier responded cautiously to the red offers.
He said that cooperation would certainly not be successful if Faymann tried to interfere with the internal affairs of the EIA.
It is still open in the party if they choose the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must undoubtedly be discussed within the EIA itself.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to assume the responsibility of the government" - Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has been launched in Paris, its host is France, which this year is also the President of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party for Fidesz, in her full message, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, called attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations affecting the Roma children and it is also the greatest obstacle to the prevalence of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European social rights protection organizations attended the meeting.
Járóka - according to the press office of the Fidesz group of Members in the European Parliament - warned that, in addition to discrimination in employment, the gypsies remain outside the labour market first because of their low level of education.
"Most young gypsies have not completed secondary education and due to the poor quality of basic education, so only a small part can get university diplomas."
Járóka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investment in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Euro MP, it is necessary to raise these issues widely between the gypsies and non gypsies.
As early as school begins a gypsum student, more opportunities will be available to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"The gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must guarantee them the right to quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education" - Livia Járóka pointed out.
According to the Euro MP, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary in order to speed up the process of school deregulation immediately, so it is essential that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives be properly complied with.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer the gypsum children the opportunity to guarantee the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full-fledged citizens" - Járóka demanded.
The objective of the European Summit on Equal Opportunities organised annually since last year's Berlin meeting, which was held in the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", is to ensure a single forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at the European and national levels of the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
A decision will be taken at the end of October on the fate of the failed two Huber-Beckstein
Despite the serious electoral defeat, heads have not yet been cut off on the tops of the Bávaro CSU, and the debate on personal matters has been postponed for the time being.
Erwin Huber, party president and Günther Beckstein, Prime Minister of the Province are still in office, but it is not known how long grace will last.
The fate of the two, who suffered a catastrophic election defeat of 17 per cent, will be decided at the extraordinary convention of the party that will be held last weekend of October.
The members of the two criticized have given up on this: they are not so attached to their posts.
This was intended to reassure the angry members of their parliamentary group and of their base organization, who one day after the "tsunami bávaro" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the direction of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career - the social Christian union reached 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the attack against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria, which gives 18 percent of the German PBI.
Although in the province of the South, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to prevail, in the future they will undoubtedly have to make a coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the party's restructuring, Vice-President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber's potential successors, also has a post in the small intelligence group that opens negotiations with the Liberal FDP and the Right-Electors on a possible governmental coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about the destination is that in the list of the Libres electors, this Gabriele Pauli parliament, whose action against Stoiber was taken for the beating of the second Huber-Beckstein and then brutally erased from the scene to the ambitious local policy.
CSU's top leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition it will also receive an active role Stoiber that has so far been moving the strings in the background, the former provincial government chief and former CSU president qualified on 28 September as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel cannot be cancelled if they are unable to highlight together the CSU which played a crucial role in the success of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel that he could hardly hide his disappointment for failure, CSU's losses would not have a negative impact on the great Berlin coalition.
What is of course relative: it will not be easier to deal with the injured CSU and the social democrats' crisis continues.
The SPD with 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0
After Sunday's elections, there will be no opposition MP in the Belarusian Parliament.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability it guarantees in the country of Alexandr Lukashenko, in exchange for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by the violations of the law made during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the electoral outcome.
Although the country's legislation of 10 million inhabitants, composed of one hundred and ten Members, has not been opposed for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the united opposition under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, would "allow" the entry of some Members of the opposition to parliament as a result of the amendment of the Constitution this time.
Thus ODSZ removed the boycott that originally wanted to do.
In the light of the opposition's expectations, Belarus, which is increasingly dependent on Russia - which has taken a credit to moderate the import of natural gas on Russia's face, and which has contributed to the sale of Russia to Beltransgaz, the owner of the pipeline that passes through the country - has wished to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not allow Lukashenko and other high-level politicians to enter because they have a political regime considered anti-democracy.
It was a sign of disengagement when the OSCE, in evaluating the electoral campaign, placed emphasis on positive phenomena rather than on errors - such as the ban on the participation of a third of opposition candidates.
The OSCE's primary report on Monday, however, even criticised the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and in particular that the opposition could not be present in counting the votes.
With all this in mind, the opposition feels an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners were released, and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - has been considering the two regions as independent for a month.
- We have taken two steps forward and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has been initiated - our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevich said.
According to the 2006 presidential elections opposition candidate, it is desirable to maintain this situation, although "the regime is afraid to allow even one opponent to enter that Parliament without weight".
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations when it sees the results, but rather tries to get voters their message about the need to make economic reforms.
- This clearly causes us many problems because we have to print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities make it difficult to distribute it, but even so I see that there are more and more people who support the change among older people as well - Milinkevich said, arguing that the Lukashenko regime, which believes its main result is the creation of social security, does not consider it to be adequate or even retired, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Due to the debt of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the decomposition of social security that "seems to be the silence of the cemeteries" - Milinkevich said.
Russian observers opposed the opposition policy called democratics at the elections.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Community of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Rio Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in facts," so that the lack of opposition is nothing but testimony of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunette: "From now on you have breakfast before you start working"
It has never happened in the History of the Chigi Palace that they set up automatic doors to control the entry and exit of the staff.
but from today it starts with this measure against who it is and then goes to the bar to take a coffee at work.
This novelty has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The automatic doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument for working better, with greater productivity, greater presence and more services" the minister says.
"Now there is a new season of responsibility and transparency.
This is Reformism," he again stresses Brunetta.
The installation is completed with Palacio Chigi in all the Council Presidency buildings.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There has been no resistance on the part of employees, the Secretary-General assures us: "There has been a change shared by the workers and there has been cooperation on the part of them".
Finally, I no longer have breakfast at work; no more coffee and lunch.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a good capuchine at 7:00 in the morning is a holy hand."

of Rome, the Minister states that "in three months the absence of public employees' diseases has been reduced by 50%, meaning 60,000 more people to work in one year".
And it adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more effective
Italian, "which wage dynamics – the minister explains – have been double over the private sector in the last 8-10 years and above the inflation rate".
For the time being, millions of public employees have joined in opposition to the rules of the Brunette Decree by acceding to the request supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service shows the numbers, the lowest absence of work due to illness – writes consumer association – the people of the 'weak workers' are constantly increasing.
There are millions of employees of the right and productive public administration in Italy who have joined in declaring war against the illegal norms of the decree."
In particular, the Tar contests the exclusion of aggregated economic treatments due to disease due to service; the extension of the time-frames in which medical visits to the sick employee are carried out; and other aspects contained in the new provisions requested by the Minister.
Work Accidents, Napolitano: "Cross prevention"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inaill data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the gravity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost double deaths in relation to homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media on this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates the 58th national day in all provinces of Italy by victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," says the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association Mutated and Invalid for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of State expresses his "great appreciation for the constant partnership effort in favour of prevention at work, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"It has been manifested, a 'suffering', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, by their dimensions, provoke the cry of the media and the participation of the public opinion, instead of the everyday reality offers us dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is no doubt a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
It is particularly important to take the numerous initiatives promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the phenomenon alive, not to stop the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislation.
For his part, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber has stressed "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes upon all institutions a determined commitment to put an end to the urgent.
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not take away the number of white deaths as impressive," noted the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not really want this "decreasing trend" to be translated into less attention, because it is precisely when attention decreases that the tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at a general level there is still too little to be done to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
We need, at our criterion - Mercandelli has highlighted – greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the school world."
"It serves a further effort - it has added - in terms of communication and public awareness.
But above all, it serves a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary protection provided for victims of work" and the "assistance derivation towards which the system has been directed in recent years".
"The aim is to give the worker back the insurance guarantee - he added - because the luck of the accident does not have to depend on the gift made available by the legislator every time."
Mp3 readers in charge, risk hearing
Listening to high volume music for a long time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent injury to the hearing.
As regards the European Commission, a communication issued in Brussels cites the opinion of the Scientific Commission on Emergency and Recently Identified Health Risk (Csseri) of the UE, published today.
"From this scientific opinion – it is read in the note – it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than one hour per day having the high volume apparatus risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such a high number of young people who often use portable musical devices and high-level mobile phones can unconsciously ruin their ears in an irremediable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"Of the scientific evidence – follow Ue’s responsibility – there is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What counts is to raise awareness of consumers and deliver this public domain information.
We must review, in addition to the existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, in order to be widely effective and to take the step of the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the large use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise that is the result.
"Scientists - the Ue Executive concludes - confirm that it is a matter of concern and the European Commission will now discuss with the Member States and stakeholders that measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and similar devices."
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits to 100 dB the noise level of portable musical devices, but concerns increase as the auditory damage that may result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to limit these damage by using solutions such as lower levels and noise exposure time.
In his view, the Ue Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical devices hear louder (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours per week exceed the current limit for the maximum noise allowed at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for longer periods of time risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
This means that 5-10 per cent of users of such devices are affected and the number can be quantified between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the UE.
Rome, Germany gives way to the Commission for the future of capital
Today, the accounts will be closed in March.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which has been established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Caracalla Terms.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission discussed the main points for Rome.
Once the gates were closed in March, the board and the municipal council evaluated analysis and projects, in order to present the Strategic Plan for Rome in June with the "official ball" of the municipality and its lieutenant Gianni Alemano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – it tends to emphasise German – it will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council, can then take action.
There is no leftover role, only the will to have a place where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June – the lieutenant announces – we will present the strategic plan using the Commission's work on the future of the capital of Rome."
To whom the Commission accuses of useless, since its opinions are not binding, Germany replied: "All depends on the work that will be able to carry out the Commission and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
The policy is almost always crushed in regular management and in times of emergency that return.
On the contrary, we want to look beyond and long-term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
The Roman lieutenant also tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, it does not cost a euro to Roman citizens and will serve to make them participate and reason on the best minds expressed by the capital".
For Germany, in fact, "there is a need to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or mobile, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, of which we have an absolute need, thinking with a unitary spirit to its future".
A future that, in particular, requires the lieutenant of Rome" would not only be limited to the present municipal boundaries but rather look beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of capital but "also considering the role that Rome can and should develop as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
The first anti-American president.
He wrote an American political note that interests him to go independently: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the US economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam".
The attacks against Obama are increasing as the date of the elections is approaching.
has written a Miami woman on a Web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a great stone face: he believes he has won the highest office of the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!".
They're actually attacks that don't say much; they're clearly racial attacks and they don't answer the voters' question: Will he be a good president? And there are polls; everyone says Obama wins and has a good advantage.
Also in this case there is someone who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A daily newspaper in Mississippi, in the interiors of the South of the United States, has written an editorial: once in the booth to vote, we will know who will vote for the American patriot.
It comes out one side of the American mindset covered until the last.
"Tell them what they want, we'll think about where to put the cross, whether on Obama or on McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we'll leave America.
things you never said before before now, which seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the democratics is George Bush.
Have you asked 1500 people: what were Bush's mistakes during his term of office? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home to kicks in the back.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to make their bags.
Also, Iraq for the most part has been Bush's weak point.
Whoever takes over George W's position will have a huge duty to develop.
Use, the economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet, "killer" of the printed paper.
Fifty American journalists have been questioned by PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mental control for the future.
Yes, journalists today are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly declared themselves less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for U.S. journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
In addition to the cuts in the room where editors work to carry out the newspaper, this is a major problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if you do not want traditional journalism as most people understand it to be reduced substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the U.S. journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is following the wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65 per cent.
Pressure against emissions.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
The biggest publishing houses open a break on the Internet, for many views such as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn has increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope of "doing something good" by journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is between those who run the newspapers – or the directors – and journalists who work for them.
56 per cent of national executives are sure that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage is down to 23 per cent.
For some this has to do with the "security of work".
Executives who intend to lose their jobs in three years are 47 per cent at the national level.
For the journalistic staff it is 30%.
The "safe job" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a nation such as the United States, with 300 million people and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and thus become a matter of "getting or leaving it".
Directors receive almost always good salaries, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, but retirement and social insurance.
For holidays, reasoning is complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 complete days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, are "enferman" followed during the year.
It's all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: THE COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPOLA
The president of the second section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of the real estate owner Danilo Coppola who had requested to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
He is being investigated for bankruptcy in the area of the anti-agreement investigation on the Unipol-Bnl scale.
In the course of the arrest process at his office last week, he obtained the house release, transforming it into mandatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate might travel from the city of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these travels (by which the pm has voted otherwise) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already emerged a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 million rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this, but interested in punishing Wall Street rather than saving the economy.
The New York Times gives us a confirmation yesterday informing us that the current crisis is disarming the Republican party, increasingly divided among its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and to the world of finance, especially strong in the states of the Centre and the South.
The soul, in fact, has become prepotent with the vote of whom he spoke at the beginning.
This is just an example of the mutations, of the major mutations, which the current economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not just here.
Both in the United States and in Europe the crisis has long been seen as an acceleration of incubation phenomena that are solidified and coming out of the light with the new climate.
The first of these phenomena is the re-update, the extraordinary reactivation, of the dual category of state-sovereignity in relation to a type of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a banking-finance crisis that has, if any, strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all, much more the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are compromised.
What immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and those families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically worldwide but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of play or do not have much to say: crucial evidence is the European Union that is always divided between the different interests and the different state strategies does not reach any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone is expected to intervene, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and, above all, the grant of funds: from the time it comes to the court, it is only the state that owns the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy matters.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two incalculable value resources, values under certain circumstances in which no market is likely and no organization can ever have the same measure.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the state of the nation is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance provided that the new development of the economy tends to attribute it to a very linked factor to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of ever more sophisticated technology, of immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already intended to dominate the world, we realized that our future would have to make more and more accounts with little immaterial things such as water, crops and oil.
All things that, you know, can certainly be transported from place to place on earth but are also completely united in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever is found to be a sovereign, he certainly has many more letters in respect of him who is not, and to whom he has the misfortune of living in a post without crops, without oil and without water.
I arrive at the second novelty that but presupposes a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Policy and Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaders, of a perceived economic nature inadequate with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a sense disturbing: a discredit, intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of Western countries in an increasing number.
It seems to advance more and more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites so far growing, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the understanding exception of the term, had made itself time and to be more strange to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in a few words, feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which are reflected in a "refuge" election or in the sudden changes in collective humours of recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Bavier to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the American Congress against Bush (and also with the victory of the right in Italy that has something to do).
It is felt that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their journals, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say something, make it increasingly difficult to understand and then to represent, what has been taking shape since today are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis is renewing, increasing and potentially disrupting.
In front of all this talking about a "mass rebellion" today is frankly exaggerated.
But having eyes open certainly isn't.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Conquering the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in a future walk on the walls like the spider man.
It is the goal of several American research centres and now a team of four institutes has approached a lot.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to stick a body of 100 kilos on a vertical wall.
THE STUDIO – American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of those who use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a spaghetti pile" explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of gecos, covered with microscopic hair that can ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
Tests made on different materials, such as glass, teflon and lilac paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of this reptile and at the same time "is easily removed from the walls" explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton University of Engineering.
JOIN FOR PAREDES? -"This material could be useful as a transitional adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Layers to walk through the walls exactly like the spider man? Layers Yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are drivers of heat and electricity.
Other applications might have to do with aerospace engineering.
No superheroes for the moment.
OTHER INVESTIGATION - Also Berkeley University, California, is dedicated to the search for a new adherent.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made of micro fibers as hair that self-clean the dust during the movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adherence.
Drugs: never with fruit juice
Attention to apple juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken concomitantly with some drugs, alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing as appropriate, the efficiency with severe health consequences.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices are packed as fresh associated with the assumption of some medicinal products David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in progress sends a new alarm to Philadelphia: just a glass of apple juice, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some drugs, canceling the beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
The apple juice was already under charge because it was held responsible for increasing at toxic levels some anti-arrhythmic, antibiotics, ansiolytics, antihistamines and neurologicals.
PHARMACEUTICALS TO RISGES – The same Italian drug agency had given the news in a newsletter two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink in the case of taking a drug such as Diasepam or methadone.
NOT ONLY THE POMELO – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active principles inhibited by apple and other juices.
From here the call by Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: "These findings in general are pointed out to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually try to change the informational notes of the same.
That is why we must always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines that are taken and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let us be impressed, clearly ask the doctor or pharmacist» the expert from Ansa stressed.
The New Economy in Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for Economics has been awarded to American Paul Krugman by his studies, his trade models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a Keynesian neo teaching at Princeton University and is a New York Times editorialist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's decisions on the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the 11 September 2001 attack on Enron, Krugman had planned in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequence for the United States.
A forecast that triggers much controversy and that for several years it has come to the economy, but that has now been revealed exactly.
"I am surprised and a little upset at how the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has quickly disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "very valuable economist", but also a proclaimer with a "very aggressive style, particularly critical of the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, here's the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source of personal productivity suite that aims to attract more and more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to known Microsoft Office.
After a work of almost one year part of the voluntary developers, of which their back is monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several news: at the welcome screen and the less denser magazine interface, others are added more consistent, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF(Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Attention also paid to multi-functioning with the Office 2007, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as that that allows to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via email, or the possibility of importing the PDF file into the graphic processing module, keeping the original aspect of the page.
On this front you can always create "PDF Hybrids" documents that accumulate the typical Adobe format graphics with elements of a spreadsheet or a text editor.
The Collaboration is an element that has received various improvements within the applications: on the spreadsheet they can intervene on a number of users, avoiding conflicts of amendments, in the drafting of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for better recognition at the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the clouds), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to English that was in the mirror since Friday.
Besides for Windows and Mac OS, as the suite is usually also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation CD can also be sent at home or at work upon request.
And if the subject of the free can be a link to the dissemination in the homes, it is in business area that Open Office will test the suite, try the big bet, and can already have several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And there is no lack of even the realities that provide an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, where business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of PowerPoint; Dbase, in the case of known Access is the program that allows you to work on the base data; and finally Draw the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the output of the new version it is likely that the expected figure can be exceeded.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New positive case on the tour of France: this is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, team Gerolsteiner, third grader and winner of the best climber reminder.
To give the news is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26 years old, is the fourth positive runner to the Third Generation, after the Italian Ricardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also they from Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of Kohl's blood samples takes place between those conducted in the last few weeks at the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry lab.
If the evidence against them confirms that it is positive, Austria will lose its third post to the Tour and will go against the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm Kohl's positive doping news in the third generation is the head of the French antidoping agency Pierre Bordery, who has declared to the Associated Press that he has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has been positioned on the podium at the back of Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, awarding the memorial of the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS:New York TIMES ARE YOU QUESTIONED, IS ITALIA RACIST?
Italy from an immigrant country has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" hosted with hostility.
Is this turning the beautiful country into a racist nation? That's what the New York Times is asking in a long article that has devoted to the debate on racism in Italy, starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso murdered last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case shows what the New York Times defines as the "north paradise": the northern regions are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" are recorded but also the highest anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the highest support of the North League".
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
Also, the new legislation sought by the Lega opens the ban on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestines is cited as a paradigm for climate change in Italy.
Trend marked by the Pope and by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano finding Benedict XVI in Congress has asked the State and the Church to work together to combat racism".
Students victims of cheap rental, up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest survey in the Sunia, the union of tenants, renting an individual room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"the phenomenon has already taken on very serious features to the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people at the highest cost that the family would have to bear – explains the head of the Sunia study office, Laura Mariani – in these cities strong demand has completely distorted the market to such a point as to trigger a process of generalized increase even for residents."
Apart from the fact that in most cases rental offers contain a number of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, canon-free, under tied rentals.
For Sunia there is a need for extraordinary interventions that, through the revision of the tax levy, prices can be regulated.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, approximately 450 euros are served; for an individual room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students focus on areas near the University, they serve €250/280 for a bed in a double room and from 370 to 500 for an individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) you will be asked for approximately 600 euros for an individual room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros per single room) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save only if you change the peripheral area: 300 euros per bed and 450 per single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and around.
In Naples a bed serves you 300/450 euros, a room is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed you will be served 250/350 euros, at least 350 per individual.
in the youngest cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but have a higher weight in the city economy.
In cities like Perugia, where the renting phenomenon for students and extra-Communitys is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: an increase of 25/30% of the canon to foreign students compared to Italians.
Goodbye to the old Paradise movie, the cities cancel the historical rooms
Historic cinematographic rooms close favoring the Multiplex.
"A city without cinematographic rooms in a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by Director Giuseppe Tornatore photographes effectively what is happening in the large Italian urban centres and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalization of the cinemas, which with the birth of the great meticians in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the features of a real cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historical places, full of memory," it is as if a friend died, a friend with whom a piece of space was shared and so much emotion," observes the director of the new Paradise movie, the film that twenty years ago won the first Oscar and the great jury award to Cannes, who counted on the poetry of a movie hall in the province and the nostalgia by the way of living the movie that I may have lost forever.
The figures given by Anec, the main association of traders, are clear: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have been closed, and most of them are mainly rooms in the main cities: 10 minors in Florence, 9 minors in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 minors in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures are the first, Emilia-Romana with 82 less cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the responsible for its disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, these three Italian regions themselves that have recorded the largest number of new methicine cinemas: 195 screens but in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 being in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romana.
“Italian exercise has developed irrationally” observes Paolo Protti, President of Anec, “it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to ensure that those already existing exist, because when a city hall closes, not all its frequenters are willing to transfer to the Meticons.
Not to mention the lack of funds for traders: the state's previous debt is about EUR 10 million.
It is shameful from an ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To support the sector would be between EUR 16 million and EUR 18 million per year.’
Interestingly the case of Bologna, the first Italian city concerned by the closures, decided to repair itself with the signature of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to promote and protect the cinema mono room either in the historical centre or in the periphery.
The proposed rules include means of tax facilitation for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: viewers may enter the restricted traffic area and have special parking rates.
"It is an initiative that I like" observes Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
It is true, that in contrast to the extra power of meticons, traditional rooms need to improve the quality of sound and image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of the traditional film is a theme that was always important to me: the closure of the Bavarian film, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the chispa that convinced me to carry out the "New Paradise movie", which I had been thinking about 10 years ago.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass by the Rialto or the National Road Quirinale already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the cartels enraged by the dust, I turn to the other side.”
The link between politics and 'andrangheta, has been arrested by the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniform the municipal elections for interested parties to the Pyromalli cosca."
The accusations made by the magistrates of Calabria's Antimony Directorate are heavy to the lieutenant and vice-president of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the lieutenant of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by mafias association.
Also arrested is Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his lawyer's grandson, boss's homonymous, already convicted of mafia criminal association and to pay 10 million euros.
"Despite any legal and moral standards, and in good sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay consultations to lawyer Piromalli.
"The Mafia family - the judges write - would have been allowed to enter the municipality officially by making it possible to control and control the public administration."
The president of the Agazio Loiero regional council does not hide that "agreements between evil organized life are a lot" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the Andrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean."
The arrests this morning are added to those of the last July after the police had announced the mafia family's head court Pyromalli.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always under alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been raised from the task of managing the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, Lieutenant, of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, after the round-off in May 2006, had been elected head of a right-center coalition.
I explode when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call the vice-minister of the interior who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything for a political issue, but the judges in the arrest order signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even come to ask for the variation of the project on road A3.
Of the environmental impressions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, "the willingness to support the demands of an entrepreneur, a representative of a group very close to the Pyromalli clan, uniforming the public administration's elections on the interests of Mafia families".
When energy comes from the waves, the big ones come down to the stage
It is an exhausted deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now being discovered by the major global energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the big ones look like Chevron.
The possibility of energy recovery of the sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years and in the 1970s along with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of low oil, in 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now that environmental cases and the new increase in oil are driving the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of the waves of the sea.
This amount would be twice the current production of nuclear power plants.
And there would be currents and tides.
Giants at the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has signed an agreement to build an implant in Northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced, it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy are always more and between these companies who have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology – he has declared the spokesperson of a company associated with ha to the U.S. oil colossus to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal – and is assessing the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question is on obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a very important signal, if it is considered that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and President Bush has recently activated a plan to carry out new drillings.
In addition to Chevron is Verdan Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey to follow the way of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed, indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts are talking about technology at the beginning, because marine energy has no doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now, impacts such as Portuguese or Scottish are of small size and do not seem to create major problems to the ecosystem.
To produce large-scale energy, a technology must be used with a greater environmental impact.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a good system of unity between them.
The strength of the waves, which moves the good ones upwards and downwards becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
Pressure turns a turbine that feeds a generator in turn.
Electricity is shipped to the coast through submarine cables.
For now there are four implants of this type in development, pending only federal approval, apart from energy, could serve as a military facility.
Verdan Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping centre and parking, using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of the water when there are tides, turns the pallets of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said he has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary permits to use energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say, in the Institute for the Development of Electricity, is now worth the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is above all about the energy of tides that you, such as New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others approaching the coast, have invested $7 million in 2008 and an investment of 35 million for 2009.
