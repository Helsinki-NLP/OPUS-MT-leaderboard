The stars give light and heat, because the energy created when hydrogen joins (or merges) forms a heavier element.
Scientists are working to create reactors that can generate energy in the same way.
This, however, is a very difficult problem to solve and will take years before we see a useful fusion reactor built.
The steel wire is rolled up on the surface of the water because of the surface resistance.
Surface pressure occurs because of water molecules on each other's surface that are more attractive than air molecules on it.
The water molecules create invisible layers on the surface of the water that allow things like the needle to cover over the water.
At a modern ice-cream, there is a double side with an empty gap between it. These two sides allow better ice-creams, even when cooled.

To get back to the previous energy level, those atoms have to throw out more energy they get from the light.
"They're doing this in a way to pick up a small particle of light that's usually called "photon."
"Illuminators call this process "stimulating radiation emissions" because atoms are stimulated by light, which causes light photon emissions, and light is one type of radiation."
The next image shows an atom that picks up photos. Of course, in the real world, photos are much smaller than what they are.
Photos are even smaller than atom absorbers.

When the torrential waters opened up along the Mystic River in the shallow sea, they quickly extended the fence with a short stone wall to the north end on the small shore.
Gridley or Stark sat about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered no one to release the gun until they were regular.
America's plan depends on the launch of coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder was able to launch an attack on the British garrison in Bordentown to block the aid.
General James Ewing will carry 700 militia across the river at Trenton Ferry, take a bridge over Assunpink Creek and prevent enemy troops from fleeing.
A major attack force of 2,400 will cross nine miles north of Trenton, and then split into two groups, one below Greene and one below Sullivan, to launch an attack before dawn.
By changing the course of four miles to run half a mile, speed became less important and endurance became a necessity.
