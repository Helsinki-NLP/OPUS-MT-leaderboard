The cat sleeps at the table.
I don't know what to do.
Don't burn.
You're right not to love me.
I don't know.
All cats?
You're our drug.
Say that's funny.
It's freezing.
We'll have a chorum if we live.
You love me and you love my dog.
We're a drug.
You're young.
You need to figure it out.
Tom took a cup and drank it.
You can't cry.
I've been looking for you.
And get in.
We're even paying for the spring.
It's my brother.
Why are you crying?
Let's go to bed.
Are you right?
Rhino runs the border between Fr.
I can't touch my milk.
I love them.
I'm just saying you're a full-blown postman.
Nın is a heavy - metal cloud.
Didn't you see my path?
What about us?
Who's Ken?
I'm hungry.
Even if you're the only one to help.
There's five days at school.
He's covered up.
The sun is holy.
To live me.
It's been nice.
When were you born?
There are young · sometimes very young ·
Nın is never alive.
Look at home.
The door's open.
We don't want to.
We'll never find it.
Let's just change it.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you.
My father's a little thirsty.
She's got to go.
If that's not the case, it's just the question.
I don't know. I don't know.
I've heard of my good creature.
We're all here.
I'm gonna kill you.
Oh, my God!
You gave me a good thing.
Make me a good creature.
Thank you.
Give you five bucks.
The dog's got the fox.
And indeed, it was Tom who was born to him.
I forgot.
You are already in heaven, that I may inherit your kingdom, that I may be your will, and that I may dwell in heaven and on earth.
It's been a long time.
Not with anything.
Don't move!
David at home.
I don't know my name.
We're out of line.
Help me make a good thing.
I want you to live.
Cold.
When are you born?
Wait for me!
Turn us away from hating our piece.
At three o'clock, there were no oxides.
His heart hurts.
Sleep with the train.
Who said that?
That's the way it is.
I couldn't ask you my question.
I could use a backrub right about now.
Tom's not in Rinnah.
Can you tell us five places near my village?
We'll go home and live.
This is the prince.
Buy your room.
When did you first meet Tom?
No, it's not.
Hot. There you go.
Why didn't you tell us?
We don't have to drink a mouthtick.
A young man.
That would be a fine ceremony.
I can do it again.
It was you.
I love you.
But I'm not a prowl.
That's you.
It's a big deal.
Don't you want to go?
What are you doing?
It's two years old.
You're my good creature.
Thank you!
Don't you see my path?
Do you speak Russian?
I couldn't stand it because we had milk.
I don't know who to drink.
Am I a coward?
Why aren't we talking?
The quiet voice.
You've got the knife, you've got the knife.
You can't be scared.
Ouzer and Ousten.
There's a lock on the table.
What would you like?
Buy yourself a room.
"Observe your eyes."
The next day, the children will be happy to talk to you.
Didn't she see my path?
What would you like?
Is he home?
Don't play in this room.
Where are you first Sir Tom?
I'm not going to anyone's house.
Help me make things right.
Look, you're the only one who can help.
God help your brother. You've been so helpful.
Will he be home?
Did you help?
It's gone. It's gone.
It's the end.
Not with the seven.
Don't you look like we're on our way?
Cat sleeps on beds.
It's just that we're gonna have to get some water.
You can't cry.
You are already in heaven, that I may inherit your kingdom, that I may be your will, and that I may dwell in heaven and on earth.
Three fish.
The Greek text.
I'm a pear.
She had him on the other side.
She couldn't go to school for five days.
Forget it.
Oh, my God!
Fish in clean water.
I'm a reader.
The gold is a great source of water.
We've been drinking wine for a year.
Why didn't you tell us?
You're young.
Are you anything black?
To the south!
Why did you ask?
That's not what I'm talking about.
Wüttgel's set of the coast.
It's been a while.
He's got a chair on his head.
She's not crying.
I found my father lying in the barn.
You're God.
Go to us.
At least I left you with my heart.
Cat's a bird.
Life is a right of good.
Winter's mine.
Buy yourself a room.
Do you speak Russian?
The dog jumped.
Thank you!
Thank you very much!
The disciple came to London.
Wait for me!
It's a five-year-old who's been bitten by a big guy.
What would you like?
I don't know. I don't know.
Did you have a baby?
Give me a taste of that good creature.
Please help me.
I've swallowed the glass.
Why are you asking?
I'm sick of school.
Right, it's the same.
I'm quiet and I'm tired.
Do you want a goat on the table?
It's a happy dream.
Don't cry.
I'm young.
"Why don't you go there?" "But not at all."
On the table lies the yhuabloke.
It's cold.
It's not like a year.
Winter's gone.
It's cold to swim in the water.
I'm eating this!
Come on.
Are you Russian?
Who'd be so bad about the house naked?
The Son of Heaven.
She's got a wife.
IAbloko is still not blue.
Did you think Russian?
Be a seven-year-old.
When were you born?
I'm still voting.
Five bucks.
Why aren't we in trouble?
Don't talk about the whole thing.
The dog jumped.
Why don't I go home?
I'm no one else.
Well, you're making pie pies.
I'm told I'm here.
You're supposed to live in a herd.
Thank you so much.
I'm having a heart attack.
His words struck you; you could have done it.
You're my good creature.
It's not like who lives to go to his home.
The heavens and the earth are all one man's heart.
How long will it take?
Are they cats?
I'm all right.
It's the main room of what.
Ice and water.
I'm behind him.
There's no way.
Don't fall.
I'm alive.
Let's get out of here, let's get out of here.
You can do whatever you want.
You're my friend.
Oh, Kena is a cat.
Didn't you see my path?
It's a risk.
They're on the train.
I'm really sorry.
Spring's here.
I'll give it to you.
It's weird.
Look at that.
I'm sorry.
I can't think of anything.
Don't say I'm full of traffic.
Did you talk Russian?
Wait in the queue.
Does the bird live in the wild?
There's a cat.
He's out of his mind.
Man so young.
I'm hot out there.
You fixed what we can do.
Did you have a baby?
I don't know if you're quiet.
Mary's love is enough for Ivan.
Thank you!
Don't cry.
And I'm old and you can't.
Whose curve are you?
When did this end?
Help you?
Not at all.
I'm alive.
Don't drink.
I'm hungry.
Tom had a cup of coffee.
Teacher from the chair.
I've got a place to live.
It didn't happen to Tom's coon.
Take a break.
That's what I'm saying.
It's a big deal.
Where are you going?
I've got the pen and the pen.
Why didn't we say, 'Why aren't you all here?'
Never mind.
What would you like?
My mom's in bed.
I couldn't swim.
Moroza.
Oh, my God!
Who's there?
Put the îáblako on the table.
He jumped out of the sand.
Did you worry about my cat?
Kena has two cats.
The earth was filled with violence.
How much would you say?
I couldn't think of anything.
Where are you going?
But the old man had lost his temper.
To live in a flock.
You've done me a great job.
You're lying.
I mean, I'm a hundred-dollar asset.
We're in love with wine.
Tom loves you.
It's beautiful.
I'm sleeping in your door.
Give me your son-in-law.
It's like a lot of punishment.
A lot of sleep has fallen.
If it wasn't for you, you'd be an eagle.
I don't smoke them.
Love chlu and oil.
Dog in the house.
All right, all right, all right.
He killed her.
Live in the big city.
If I'm in, you're in.
Why don't we go home?
Oh, my God.
Wait for me!
Who are you waiting for?
Even though it's snowing.
You're in love with Tom.
Am I a barber?
What are they?
You're a brother.
Don't drink water.
Don't think about it.
Don't burn.
