Members of the National Assembly for Wales are afraid of confusion with the Muppets
In the case of some members of the National Assembly, the proposal to change their title in MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Wallisan Parliament) will result in a reduction.
There are plans to change the name of the National Assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
National assembly members of all political directions are afraid to become the target of the spot.
A member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned because the name “with “Twp” and “Pwp” is constricted”.
For non-valisian readers: "twp" stands for "doof" and "pwp" for "Aa".
A national meeting member of Plaid Cymru said that the whole group was "unhappy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was closed against the name change, but pointed to the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Body), which is currently drafting a law on the name change, said: “The final decision on names for the members of the National Assembly is of course with the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June the Board published the results of a public hearing on the proposals from which broad support for the name ‘Welsh Parliament’ for the National Assembly was given.
Regarding the title of the National Assembly Members, the "Welsh Parliament Members" (Walisian Members) or "WMPs" preferred the option "MWP" during a public hearing.
The National Assembly members seem to suggest alternative options, but the call for a consensus for President Elin Jones, who is to present a bill within weeks, could be a problem.
The Reform Act will contain further changes to the way in which the National Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of national members and on the establishment of the Committee system.
The members of the National Assembly may vote in full on their name in their debate on the Law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change of country name
The voters decide on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to 'North Macedonia'.
The referendum was put in place to bring a decade-long dispute with the neighbouring Greek country, which has a province with a similar name for Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that it raises this claim in the Greek field and has repeatedly spoken against its accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would not recognise the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name of the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's remain silent in view of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"The old people I spoke to said that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner," Adams said.
"There is no both today."
He said that the disappearance of the bars is reproducible.
"People's social life looks different today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood in which people are regularly located."
In the churches he fears that the money from the sale of assets is not long enough to be accepted by the church leaders and that they will “be at the beginning sooner or later”.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartments with property apartments in which people who do not support the remaining places of refuge live.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy the properties in these buildings will be white," he said, "and in order to speed up the complete closure of these churches, since it is unlikely that most people who enter these properties will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community was born in the 1930s.
A black congregation that took away its services in the vicinity became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem, who refused to set up or support blacks.
At a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson's members planned the reconstruction, they ordered the bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly referred to the bell game as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the bell game in July used other words: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who was turned 18 years ago into the largest bell game in the Riverside Church.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has happened in the last few months in St. Martin's is a complicated story with architects and contractors who have been added to part of the lay leaders of the church and part of the bishop diocese.
In July, the Board of Commons – the Board of Directors of the Community – expressed its written concerns about the diocese that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the board of directors, although it was not involved in the commission of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some community members complain about lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Hai injured in California 13-year-olds when diving to Lobstern
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster season, according to official statements, a 13-year-old boy attacked a shark while diving for Lobsters.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near the Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the broadcaster KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been on Saturday morning for about half an hour with his friends when he heard the boy's cry for help and asked several others to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought that the boy was glad to have caught a lion. But then he realized that the boy was screaming “I’m mad!
I've been kissed!".
When Hamle arrived at the boy, he found that his whole key bone had been broken.
"I yelled that everyone should come out of the water: "There is a shark in the water!" added Hamle.
The boy was rushed to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego and is in a critical state.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a couple of weeks ago a shark had been seen in the area. However, one concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body.
Officials stopped for investigation and security reasons 48 hours of beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Encinitas.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to advance the cosmetic market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's attacks cosmetic departments that are located with specialized assistants, boats, superdrugs and Debenhams.
As part of a major effort on the UK's 2.8 billion-pound cosmetic market in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow, while fashion and household supplies decline, the larger cosmetic departments will be tested in eleven branches across the country. If they prove to be successful, they will be extended to other branches next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search for supermarkets for ways to use different charging areas for television, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's, the volume of its cosmetic offer is doubled for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also available series of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees get more places and brands similar to those in shops like boats.
In addition, the supermarket conducts a relaunch of its makeup series "Boutique", so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly required by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will be tested in two Sainsbury's branch sales outlets. The first sales outlet was opened last week in Croydon in southern London, and a second one will be opened during the next year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, sales outlets are increasingly looking like shopping houses, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight against discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's since the purchase of the chain Argos and Habitats two years ago in hundreds of branchal Argos sales outlets and also a number of habitat sales outlets. This has increased food rates and the profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempt to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats at the beginning of the 2000s, but ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenues from the drug dealer's branches in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281 branches to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
The company stated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan when an extended palette of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, is added in four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury's said: "We have transformed the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as advisers.
Our brand palette is tailored to all needs. Due to the attractive environment and the affordable locations, we are now an attractive target for cosmetic purchases that violates the previous type of purchase."
Peter Jones "infuriated" after the retreat of Holly Willoughbys from a business worth 11 million pounds
“Dragons” The star Peter Jones is “wonderful”, after TV moderator Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a business worth 11 million pounds with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessories brand True.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Marke Goop.
The "This Morning" moderator, 37, announced its withdrawal to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby burned "Dragons" The Star Peter Jones by her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on her own new connection contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was supposed to have been "infuriated" as the "Golden Girl" of the television during an intense discussion on Tuesday in the center of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, due to its new business – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – could no longer devote enough time to the common homeware and accessories brand True.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Marke Goop and would probably have doubled Willoughby's estimated assets of 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from True at Instagram, Jones left Britain on his way to one of his holiday destinations.
One source said: “Truly had the highest priority for Holly at a distance.
It should ensure their long-term future over the next decades.
Your decision to withdraw was completely surprising for all the parties.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just before the market started.
In the center of Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the "This Morning" moderator, which is one of the most successful stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company because of high investment in products from kisses and candles up to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in the introduction of the market.
Moreover, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, came in March as president.
The couples spend their vacation together, and Jones holds a 40 percent share of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as moderator of the I'm A Celebrity broadcast.
A nearby source said last night: "We are not commenting on his business affairs."
Hard words "and then we fell in love"
He complained about the criticism he would have received from the news media for a comment that some would consider as "not presidential", and expected positive comments about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said that the voice of a message moderator is as follows:
"I didn't give up."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore in June of Trump was praised as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the denuclearisation negotiations are on the ground.
Over three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the senior North Korean diplomat, said on Saturday against leading politicians from all over the world on the occasion of the UN General Assembly that the North did not see the "resentative reaction" of the United States to North Korea.
Instead, he stated that the United States had imposed sanctions to maintain the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his public talk.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We faced a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: the end of the rocket test, support for the release of hostages and the return of the mortal remains of US military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside and trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be here,” Trump said and showed the number of people directly to him.
Tsunami and earthquakes devastated an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
After the earthquake of Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were said not to need them.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population were distributed, no national emergency was declared a prerequisite for the mobilization of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have in many cases made it very clear that they do not require international support, so this is a bit difficult," said Sumbun.
While Save the Children has a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work on the spot.
Sutopo, spokesperson for the Disaster Protection Authority, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu whether international bodies should participate in the aid measures.
In view of the earthquakes with which Indonesia is constantly struggling, the country is still being prepared to suffer from natural violence.
While shelters were built in Aceh Tsunamischutz, these are not a daily sight in other coastal areas.
Despite a warning in force, apparently missing tsunamis in Palu have probably contributed to the deaths.
Traveling between many islands of Indonesia is an ideal challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the place of the new catastrophe in three days at the earliest.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the proposed Indonesian infrastructure to the core of his campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the government of the Joko seeking re-election next year suffers from financing deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure from persistent confessional tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes and homes when bands of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge achieves deep compensation against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at the London Stamford Bridge Stadium with a hit in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at 0:1 back position of his team in about 27 meters away from the gate of Chelsea.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot it towards the back post.
The shooter sailed high across the Strafrum and moved into the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I’ve just tried to get into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I’ve just tried to make as much time as possible for myself,” Sturridge said against LiverpoolFC.com.
"I've seen the edge and had a contact with the ball. I didn't think too much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led the Belgian star Eden Hazard after a hit in the 25th minute at 1:0.
The blues storm gave a pass with the ferret back to Mateo, then turned off near the midfield and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a fast double pass in the middle field.
Then he shot a good strike pass, so that Hazard got into the trap.
Hazard left behind the defender and left with a left shot at Liverpool's Alisson Becker behind into the net.
Liverpool plays at the group phase of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples.
Chelsea is standing at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday in London at the UEFA Europa League Videoton.
The number of victims of Tsunamis in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the disaster protection authority on Sunday morning.
Many people are supposed to be trapped in the ruins of buildings, which were brought to the fore by the earthquake of the 7.5th of Friday, which had triggered up to six meters high waves, reported the official speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was translated into the ruins of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a man, 32, for murder suspicion after a woman was stabbed
After finding a female body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 with stab wounds in Grayson Mews in John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police call on residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I ask all those who have stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask all the persons, especially taxi drivers who may have taken something with a Dashcam, to contact us. They may have information that is of major importance to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
Today afternoon friends who believe to know the woman are met at the tabernacle to explore where she was found this morning.
The investigation was under way, and the police informed her that she was in the process of informing the next members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one can enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take hours to enter the building again.
It was heard that a police officer told a man that the entire area is now being treated as a tattoo.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the scene.
She repeats again and again, "it's so scary".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the locker and another vehicle before the locker.
Within the lockdown were several police officers who were monitoring the dwelling block.
Persons with information will be asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC to call 101 or to contact Crimestoppers under number 0800 555 111 anonymously and to refer to Minutes 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell statue before Parliament will be the newest monument of the dispute over the rewriting of history
Their prohibition would be poetic justice for his destruction of so many cultural and religious art products in England by his fanatic Puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Cricks' proposal as "tiredness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell before the Palace of Westminster became a goal.
The picture tower in the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have sacrificed for the deeds of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's glorious representation of Cromwell is evidence of the opinion and part of the historical writing of a figure, which is still worth many in the opinion of the 19th century.
Goldsmith said regarding the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is defended by many, perhaps by the end of the 19th century more than today by someone who considers the Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case of course by the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully relevant presentation is the subject of further debate.
It is certain that the conflict has formed the subsequent development of our nation in the middle of the 17th century, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents a side of this convulsions.
His services as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer pig bites Chinese farmer dead
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China.
The man to whom only the surname "Yuan" was named was found dead with a broken artery blood flowed near a pig market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject pig vaccines in Xining Province of Qinghai, China on May 30, 2005.
He was reportedly on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door was open to a nearby pighouse.
He said there was a big male pig in the stable with blood on the sneezing.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kilos heavy pig had bitten the farmer.
"The legs of my cousin were bloody and confused," was quoted by Guiyang Evening News, the cousin to whom the last name was called "Who".
Recordings of a security camera showed how Yuan entered the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One market manager said the Evening News that the pig was detained to prevent attacks on other people while the police collected evidence at the Tatort.
The Yuans family and the market authorities negotiate reports of compensation for his death.
Although it is rare that pigs attack people, such cases are known.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290 kilos of heavy pig introduced a Welsh farmer between himself and a tractor until the woman of the farmer could swallow the animal.
After a farmer was fed by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs were not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood could work as an "outbreaker".
“They’re just played.
They like to whisper and are very curious, ... they're not about to hurt someone.
You only have to treat them with the right measure of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurrikan Rosa weakens on the way across the colder water on the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring flood-stricken rains to North Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday at 5:00 o'clock east coast time, Rosa showed wind speeds of 136 km/h, corresponding to a category 1 Hurricane, and was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, the Pacific begins to form a trolley that moves east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, high tropical humidity is transported north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will be triggered on Monday in parts of Mexico up to 25 centimeters of precipitation.
Then the tropical humidity produces in the coming days due to interactions with the attracting Trog wide-spread heavy rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation can cause dangerous fluctuating floods, water-driving protection and possibly earthworms in the desert.
High tropical humidity results in precipitation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, mainly in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation is expected.
Due to the spread of tropical precipitation, there is the possibility of fluctuating floods with fast worsening conditions.
In view of the threatening tropical defeats, it is urgent to step into the desert.
Strong precipitation can cause canyons to become streaming, and wetlands bring local winds as well as wind that brings dust with them.
The nearby Trog brings local heavy rains to parts of the coast of southern California.
It is possible that total impact amounts of more than one centimeter that can lead to a low level of water-driving protection and smooth roads.
This would be the first defeat of the rainy season in this region.
The first single tropical rainshows reach Arizona on Sunday and Monday morning. On Monday and Tuesday it rains widely.
On Tuesday, strong rains spread into the Four Corners region and continue on Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as the Arctic cools while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the coming days, the constant summer heat tries to develop and expand again.
For a large part of Central and Eastern America, a warmer beginning of October is expected with far-reaching temperatures of 27 oC from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast points to a high probability of above average temperatures in the first half of October in the east of the United States.
Over 20 million viewers have seen Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
Over 20 million viewers have seen on Thursday six television networks the binding statements of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political Patts situation was halted. On Friday, TV broadcasters interrupted their regular program due to a turn in the last minute: a deal negotiated by Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, so the FBI should conduct a one-week investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh was drunk at a high school party, that she had been upset and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure this didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company determined the average viewers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network that had broadcast the hearing, the numbers were not available immediately.
Nielsen also generally has problems measuring audiences in offices.
To get this back into the right perspective: This corresponds to the numbers of spectators in a play-off football game or in the Oscar award.
The messenger Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support the nomination of Kavanaughs, listed the highest number of all networks, according to Nielsen with an average of 5.69 million viewers of the entire day.
ABC came with 3.26 million spectators in second place.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained large after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama from Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican had issued a statement that he would therefore vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by CNN and CBS as protestors on the road to a hearing by the Justice Committee with words.
He stood for a minute with a lowered look while he was slammed. The scene was transmitted live at CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
"They have power while so many women are powerless," said one woman.
Flake said his office had issued a statement and added before the chair concluded that he would have more to say in the hearing before the committee.
All cable and radio networks sent hours later live than the Justice Committee should vote on the continuation of the nomination of Kavanaughs to vote on the entire Senate.
Flake said, however, that he would do this only on the condition that the FBI, like the democratic minority, will investigate the charges against the candidates next week.
Flake was partly convinced by discussions with a friend, the democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flakes' decision was of great importance, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation into the charges brought against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
Prime Minister Theresa May accused in an interview with the Sunday Times Critics of her plans for leaving the European Union to use the future of Britain for political purposes and undermine the interests of the nation.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will meet on 29 September 2018 at the Conservative Party in Birmingham.
In addition to the interview with her on the cover page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called "Checkers Plan" for Brexit by proposing that British and EU customs should be reciprocally used as "absolute".
Dead shots on Wayde Sims: Police detect suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shots on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested according to Baton Rouge police.
The authorities published video footage of the conflict between Sims and Simpson. Sims lost his glasses during the fight, according to the police.
As the CBS partner station WAFB reported, the police secured the glasses at the Tatort and said that Simpson's glasses had been found.
After a survey of Simpsons, the police reported that he had been on Wayde's death squad.
The lawyer reports that the deposit was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office published a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound on the neck.
The police are grateful to the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the federal police technical lab, the Southern University Police and the people in the area for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional law enforcement authority for their "careability and their pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m-large bird player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for the LSU basketball.
In the last season he achieved an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach of LSU, Will Wade, said that the team was "deeply frightened" and "stand under shock" over Waydes' death.
"You're always afraid of something like that," Wade said.
Vulkan eats ash in Mexico City.
Ash emitted from the Volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after increased activity in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of collagen and harassment.
Pictures in social media showed thin ash layers on the windshields of cars in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have established an earthquake of 7.1 central Mexico since September 2017, increased activity on the 72 kilometres south-east of the main city.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Meetings between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between the PIC and Pro Independence Demonstrators. Thousands took part in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarising independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were held back from the emergency police ordered them with eggs and also sprayed paint powder, so that dark dust clouds were created in the streets normally inhabited by tourists.
In the course of the day, it also came to handcuffs with the police who used their battalions to slow down the fight.
Several hours of scandalous pro-independence groups "Don't forget, don't forgive", while they faced Unionists who called "Long Living Spain".
As the local press reported, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries in protests.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which was seen as illegal by Madrid, however, by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very tense.
The voters had decided with overwhelming majority for independence, although the vote was low, as the dissidents had mostly boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes before the polls.
Pro-independence groups had camped in the open on Friday night to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist protest, said he saw the prospects that Catalonia would achieve independence, no longer with hope.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying before joy because they could choose, but now we hang up," he said.
Despite an important, although few, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties this year had difficulties maintaining the momentum. Many of their most famous leaders are either in exile or in prison, where they await their procedures because of their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said the conflict was cut by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting tense," he said.
On Saturday Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been investigating since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for election to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for the European elections, it is the best option to push down democratic values and oppression by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after the car house was repaired
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been robbed of a car several times.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and buildings themselves were damaged.
In addition, it may have been shot on the car with an armbrush.
Menga-Treffer means for Livingston 1:0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Mengas' first gate for Livingston won the victory.
The rising Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the first defeat for Steven Gerard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Mengas hitter proved crucial that Gary Holt's team was able to draw the same line as Hibernian in the second half of the year.
Gerrard's team remains unbeatable during this season in the Premiership and stands against the hearts of eight points next Sunday.
Earlier on Thursday, the Rangers in Europe are the guests of the League for Rapid Vienna.
In the meantime, Livingstone can increase his winning series in the Division to six games, which means that Chief Trainer Holt has not yet recorded defeat since his acquisition of Kenny Miller in the last month.
Livingston misses chances against free playful guests
Holt's team should have been in charge for a long time before the meeting, since its directness put the Rangers in front of the various problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but got slower in front of the door. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he was incarcerated to meet Craig Halkett's headshot at the door.
The hosts were pleased to let the Rangers play ahead, as they knew that they could prevent the guests in standard situations.
In this way the crucial gate came to be.
The Rangers left a free shot, and Livingston prepared a chance to bring Declan Gallagher and Robinson Menga together in a shooting position. This shot the door with a ball contact from the center of the prison.
At this stage, the Rangers had dominated the ball ownership, but could not overcome the host's defense, and Liam Kelly remained largely unsatisfied.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos Kelly was forced to defend once.
Scott Pittman was rejected by Rangers-Torhüter Allan McGregor with his feet, and Littgow slammed the ball from another standard situation of Livingston.
Flanken came back to the prison in Livingstone and were regularly taken out of the danger zone, while two required criminal offenses – one by a necklace against the inter-change Glenn Middleton and one by a hand game – were refused.
"Phenomenal" by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception and again exceeded expectations at this upward trend.
Her playing skills and team have hardly changed since her return to the top teams, but Holt pays a great praise for the way in which he has been watching the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worall kept on track throughout the game.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were sometimes under Gerard, they couldn't reach this standard.
Her last ball was not enough – only once could they penetrate the host team – and this is something like a wake-up call for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Receive Erdogan with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), smiling faces and blue skies ruled when the Heads of Government of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes about issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and EU membership of Turkey.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons that they had stopped a 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters were nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurds – also listened. They condemned Erdogan's politics as well as the decision of the German government to welcome him in the country.
The opposite protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, which is praised by some Germans as a hero and by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Bike driver dies in a car crash
In a car crash, a bicycle driver died in London.
The crash took place around 10:15 a.m. in British summer time near the crossing of Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and the health took care of the man who died in the accident.
Months before the accident, another bicycle driver was killed in an accident with a driver's flight in the Children Street, about 1.6 kilometers away from the accident from Saturday.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and inform his next relatives.
Roadblocks and bus wires are set up, and drivers have been forced to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin prison: Six officers injured in unrest
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in an unrest prison for men.
The riots broke out at around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and continue.
Specialized "Tornado" officials have been added to end the unrest in which eight seats are involved and restricted to a wing.
Officials were treated on site for minor injuries in the face.
A spokesperson for Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been employed to repair an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that the police officers will be handed over and possibly spent more time behind bars."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the prison manager was treated after an attack by a prisoner in the hospital.
In October last year, police officers were sent to prison to deal with serious unrest, where the staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with fluctuating floods (survivors may benefit)
It is rare that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the rest of Hurricane Rosa take over the southwest of the desert and bring the risk of fluctuating floods with them.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings against fluctuating floods on Monday and Tuesday from West Arizona to the south and east of Nevada as well as to the south-east of California and Utah including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will approach with rain on Monday evening and go directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have approached Phoenix as a tropical storm or tropical depression as far as 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was a Hurricane within 64 kilometres of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation with a single to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest, including central Rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely and can be combined up to 10 centimeters.
For those who do not have the risk of fluctuating fluctuations, the rainfall associated with Rosa may be a blessing because of the drought in the region.
Although floods are of great concern, these rains are likely to be useful in part because in the south-west drought currently prevails.
According to the U. S. Drought Monitor, in just over 40 percent of Arizona, at least extreme droughts occur, the second highest category", weather.com reported.
First, the path of the Hurricane means that Rosa will meet on land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have Hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. Then the Hurricane will move north with 19 kilometres per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder water and thus weaken.
It is therefore expected that Rosa will meet on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm.
The rainfall can fall heavily in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
"From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora Desert, precipitation amounts from 7.5 to 15 centimeters are expected, with up to 25 centimeters possible," said weather.com.
Afterwards, Rosa will move as a tropical storm north across Mexico, reach the border to Arizona early Tuesday as a tropical depression and then go up to the late afternoon through Arizona to the south of Utah.
“As a major threat to Rosa or her remains, very strong defeats are expected in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora Desert and the southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center reported.
As a result of these defeats, life-threatening fluctuations in the desert and in water-driving protection as well as in mountainous areas are expected to occur on earth.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murders
After the discovery of a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset three boys were arrested in the teenage age and a 20-year-old man under suspicion of the attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured on Saturday at 4:00 p.m. in British summer time in the Excelsior-Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is "stable".
According to the Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
The officials ask all those who have records of events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered "under the community, the wrath" of the Democrats.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and uninterrupted tactics of the Democrats," Trump said in a lecture in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during the entire nomination process, Kavanaugh had suffered "under the community, the anger" of the Democrats.
Kavanaugh said on Thursday before the Congress and showed that he was sexually harassed by Christine Blasey Ford, who was both teenagers decades ago.
Ford also stated at the hearing that she was indicted.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
"A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal heads of our time, a lawyer with an excellent balance in the service of the general public," he said to his supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important choices in our life.
I'm not going in, but I'm actually going in," he said.
"That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats saw their mission to "resistance and block".
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place in the Senate no later than Friday, a senior member of the GOP management said against CNN.
Hundreds of earthquakes killed in Indonesia, rising numbers of victims
According to the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were killed on the beaches as a result of a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach of Palu on Friday, when high waves hit the beach in the breakup of the darkness up to six meters and many people died and destroyed everything that was in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of 7.5.
“When the threat came through the tsunami yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately quit, and they fell victim to it,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian Disaster Protection Authority BNPB at a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, he swam cars, trees and houses with, he hit the ground with everything,” Nugroho said. He added that the tsunami was pulled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
Some people were on the run from the tsunami to climb trees and survive, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated and placed in 24 centers in Palu.
A large number of destroyed buildings and shops, fenced and destroyed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water, were published by the disaster protection authority.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by other successors.
The earthquake series was to be found in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the energy released during the massive raid on Friday corresponded to the 200-prone energy of the Second World War on Hiroshima.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long narrow bay, the Tsunami could have grown larger, the authorities said.
Nugroho described the damage as "inclusive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found among the ruins of destroyed buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 were lost.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage could have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area named Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the baby.
The communication with Dongala was completely paralyzed according to the words Nugrohos, and there was no information.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse," said the statement.
On Saturday, the Authority was repeatedly criticised for not being informed that a tsunami had hit Palu, even though the waves had been reported officially at the time of the warning.
Amateur recordings published in social media show a man on the top floor of a building who is desperate to warn people on the street under it in front of the nearby tsunami.
Within minutes a wall of water is held on the shore and swims in buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a massive power failure that disrupted the communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities with support, but the evacuations still need urgent food and other vital goods.
The airport of the city remains closed until October and has only been reopened for aid measures.
For Sunday a visit was planned by President Joko Widodo in evacuation centres in Palu.
The number of Tsunami victims has increased to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Dongala reached the city of Palu, where the employees are located in tent accommodation in the inner courtyard of their office, but did pass through the scenes of the desert, according to the words of Dosebas.
"They told me they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the relief teams began with the hard task of launching disaster relief, some demonstrated that experts from abroad would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and personnel from abroad are only possible when the location of an accident has been explained to the national disaster area.
This has not happened until now.
"At the moment it is still a disaster on the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘okay, this is a national disaster’, we can accept international support.
While the second night since the earthquake and tsunami fell from Friday over Palu, friends and family of the still missing hoped for them on one of the wonders that shed some light on the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was dragged out of a canal.
On Sunday, rescue forces release a woman who had been incarcerated for two days under drums next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding nation team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the beginning of this month in Indonesia at the end of Asia.
Others who were imprisoned in the Roa-Roa hotel, as Mandagi added, his students.
"As a senior at paragliding, I have to carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how in hours after the news of the Roa-Roa Hotel’s collapse under the paragliders had been released, he doubted whatsApp news had sent to the contestants from Palu who participated in the beach party.
However, his messages led only to gray questions instead of blue hooks.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Stealing $26,750 while filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release by the Newport police, on Friday morning, in Newport on the Levee, a Brink’s employee stole 26.750 US dollars in cash.
The driver of the vehicle had learned a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to borrow more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, “a man came after the employee of Brink’s” and stole a bag full of money that was destined for the machines.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the Tabor, but the police did not tell how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons who have information on the identity of suspects are asked to contact the Newport Police under 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes its name – in Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West" (The officially known beings as Kanye West).
West, 41, has been the peak Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eight albums published in June.
The change is expected to take place at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
He is acting as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has given up for "emotional reasons".
The word is not only abbreviation of its current professional name, but it has religious significance according to its own statement for the West.
“I believe “ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “du”,” West said this year in a conversation about his album with Radiomoderator Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am we, it is we.
From Kanye, which means “the only one”, it was just “Ye” – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album rather reflects what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has worked with the West before, has already written his name with and without strings and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use the military against the civilian population
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military violence against the civilian population, while the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against students in his country is near.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never to use the military to suppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers had set fire to a peaceful demonstration in the square and killed 300 people. At that time left-handed student movements were in the process of establishing themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador congratulated young Mexicans on their monthly support for students and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education led to youth criminal gangs.
US should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
In view of China's increased activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research expenditure in this field, says investor and KI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow KI announcements from various areas of the US government, even though the US generally lacks a formal KI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: the country intends to become number one in the area of KI innovation by 2030.
"The doubling of the KI research budget would be a good start in view of the fact that all other countries are so far behind the United States, we are looking for the next KI breakthrough," Lee said.
The duplication of financial resources could double the chances that the next major success of KI in the USA would be achieved, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent KI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on a KI system that beat the top-ranking U.S. Othello players. Later he was the leader of Microsoft Research and President of the Google branch in China.
Lee praised earlier technology competitions of the US government such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked for the date of the next competition as he wanted to help identify the next visionary.
According to Lees, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies.
"Not China takes away the academic peak forces, but the companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have set up Koryphéins from universities to work on KI.
According to Lees, a changed immigration policy in the United States could also be conducive to the KI efforts in the United States.
“I think that greencards should be offered automatically in the area of the KICs,” he said.
In July 2017, China's Council of State presented its plan for the development of the next generation of KI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Lees, the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people in academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to be involved in the partner from industry and science. The White House also announced the formation of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced this month the investment of $2 billion in the "AI Next" initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than $100 million a year in KI research.
In the meantime, nothing has been done in US legislation regarding the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on a change of country name
The people of Macedonia agreed in a referendum on Sunday whether the country's name should be changed to 'North Macedonia', which would have been a decade old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour means that it raises this claim in the Greek territory. Therefore, Greece has put a veto against Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name. However, nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum. A boycott campaign raises doubts that the election party will reach the 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the vote list was: "Are you a member of NATO and the EU through the adoption of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, to which Prime Minister Zoran Zaev belongs, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth the price of admission into organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members have said that they would stick to the outcome so that it is crucial.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the election was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 per cent of registered voters had given their vote.
"I am here for my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their vote in the referendum on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia on the change of country name to open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs to tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we would like to join the raised main, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can devote ourselves to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will have an urgent need for investment for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that there will be a large majority for this, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
According to him, a 'yes' result would be a 'confirmation of our future'.
According to a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of the respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they would vote with 'yes'.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the vote must be at 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first severe blow to the policy of the provincial government since its accession in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero by Manchester City maneuvered by the entire Brighton defense to reach the gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling transferred the Brighton defense at Manchester City's 2:0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his hit in the 65th minute look ridiculous.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He jumped between three Brighton opponents and then ran into the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green triangles.
He played around a defender and then took over several more defenders on the edge of the Brighton Penal Code.
He then shot a pass to the left of Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the prison to play the ball back to Aguero, who crossed with his right shoe Brighton-Torhüter Mathew Ryan and shot at the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola against reporters.
“We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he had reached a door at this point."
It was Sterling, however, who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duell.
This door fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball at this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good strike pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed some trains to control Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky Blues attacker targeted the ball into the net just before he broke out.
City plays in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhine-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim vs. Hoppenheim.
Scherzer wants to destroy the Rockies game
Since the nationals are separated from the Playoff competition, there was little reason to force another action.
However, the ever-voluntaried gambler hopes to stand on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies on the hill, but only if this is relevant to the Rockies in the NL West that have a game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers, for the Playoffs.
The Rockies won at least one wild card with a 5:2 victory over the nationals on Friday, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Even though we don’t play anything, we can at least throw away because we know the atmosphere among the viewers here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that would meet me this year.
Why should I not take part in this competition?"
The nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but they are inclined to leave jokes in such a situation according to reports.
Scherser, for whom this would be the 34th starting player, practiced on Thursday in Bullpen and would throw on Sunday on his normal day of rest.
The Washington right-hands have this season a statistics of 18-7, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 inches.
Trump keeps broadcasting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation in relation to the Brett Kavanaugh selected by him for the Supreme Court when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the elections.
“Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important choices in our lives.
That's one of the big, big – I don't get involved, but actually I get involved, so I fight everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power again by all means, you see the community, the obscurity.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to overcome to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, said their mission was to "resistance and block".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "serious and common and disgusting and incredulous".
He called it the highest-ranking democrat in the Senate Justice Committee, Senator Diana Feinstein, which triggered a riot in the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document outside?
Uh, uh, what.
No, oh no, I'm waiting for you – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer subject to all opinions.
The party is intolerant to those who say their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party agreed to beat me, it came a little surprising.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour Members who are told that they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly, since she had risen strongly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized with the tabloid application that I had a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, or ironically similar issues, was not an opinion on Jeremy and former top politicians.
The announcement of the meeting of Nottingham East Labour said on Friday that "the meetings should all be inclusive and productive".
Most of the Friday GC meetings in my eight years as a local Labour Member were exactly that.
Unfortunately, most of the meetings today are not marked by this tone, and the promised 'friendly, more cautious' policy has been forgotten for a long time since it started at all.
It is increasingly clear that divergent views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that every opinion is then assessed whether it is accepted by the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a party leader. colleagues with whom I previously believed to share similar political views now expected me to make a turnaround and take positions with which I would otherwise never have agreed – whether with regard to national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – there’s a shipyard in the social media that calls for my election, which launches the political center and says that I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I am doing better than some of my colleagues, since the comments I have made are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who are facing daily a flow of sexist or racist insults and yet are not too small.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that reproaches have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corby asked the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we do not allow all opinions to be applied anymore, and with every request for suspicion and any change in the rules of choice, the party becomes more closely involved.
In the last two years, I have often been able to raise my head and not express my opinion so clearly, and then I would have no problems.
But I didn't go into politics.
Since I was a student 32 years ago, because of the neglect of the Thatcher government, because of which my classroom in the whole school has literally joined the Labour Party, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – as a municipality as well as as a cabinet minister.
I've never made a cure from my political point of view, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be in any way unclear about my political positions and about areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to the sponsor of the Friday application: In view of the fact that the country will be on a brexit, damage to households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I do not address this message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour Members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that I will not be held back from so many threats or political intentions, in my opinion, to act in your best interests.

Ayr versus Melrose 38:17: Unbeatable Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr has earned the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in the tenant's premiere.
They are now the only one of the ten teams unbeatable at the top of the table.
Finally, the success of the home team was due to its over-draft defense as well as to its better exploitation of opportunities, and Coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested so far in our games, and we are still unbeatable, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Recognition for Ayr, they have earned their chances better than we have.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was raised by Frazier Climo, led by Ayr. However, Melrose was able to let the numbers speak because of a yellow card for the Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by the Warriors, and Jason Baggot started a non-increasing attempt.
Climate expanded the leadership of Ayr with a criminal offence before he achieved a hit in the middle of the day and then made an increased attempt at the entrance, so it stood for Ayr at break 17:5.
Melrose, however, began the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was raised by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Then there was a longer interruption due to a serious injury by Ruarid Knott, who was borne by the playing field. After the continuation, Ayr developed his lead by an increased attempt by Stafford McDowall.
Then, as Captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and once again Melrose let the additional man pay off enormous pressure at the end of a phase by a non-increasing attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Straan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without ball against climate, MacPherson obtained from the criminal gas from a touchdown behind the front air package.
The climate has increased almost since the breakup, after Kyle Rowe David Armstrongs Boxkick was arrested and Flanchenplayer Gregor Henry sent off for the fifth attempt of the domestic team.
"Still Game" star seems ready for a new career in gastronomy
"Stil Game" star Ford Kieran appears to be ready for a change in the hospitality business after it turned out to be the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays one of the main roles in the popular BBC broadcast, which he writes and in which he plays together with his long-standing Comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
Both have announced that the upcoming ninth staff will be the last of the broadcast, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the manager of Arigungmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan was interested in climbing into Glasgow's "floating restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us": Bolivia, which includes the country, hopes that a court will open its way to peace
Matrosen patrol the marine headquarters in La Paz, decorated with tauwerk.
In public buildings there is a more blue flag.
Fleets from Lake Titicacasee to Amazon bear the motto: “The sea is our legal property.
It is a duty to win back."
Everywhere in Bolivia, the memory of the 19th century's loss of resources in a bloody conflict on Chile is as vivid as the desire to go back to the Pacific.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades since Bolivia is awaiting a judgment of the International Court of Justice, which will be held on 1 October after five years of consultation.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and well-being and expects the result of course with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the IGH judgment on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will decide for the sake of Bolivia's claim. According to this, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign access to the sea after decades of sporadic talks.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who is leading a controversial fight next year for his re-election, there is also much at stake in the judgment on Monday.
"We are just about to return to the Pacific," he praised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the Court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and believe that this would also make a slight difference.
The United Nations body established in the Netherlands is not empowered to speak to the Chilean territory and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of possible discussions.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, that the case was not "complicated".
Because of the distance from supporting the Bolivian case, the last four years could also mean a retreat.
"The current Bolivian government has raised the issue of access to the sea," Zárate said.
She pointed out that Morale's war rhetoric has stifled any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will sometimes continue their talks, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not been able to exchange ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, expressed the view that the Court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia has "an extraordinary opportunity to launch a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "make an end to the 139 years of disputes for each other", he said.
Calzadilla also argues that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – uses the subject of the sea as a political force.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to recognize that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons will only take place if it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never first disarm their nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit between the Heads of State or Government of the rivals in Singapore.
His remarks come at a time when US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be standing at a time when more than three months after the summit with the North Korean Chief of State Kim Jong-un in Singapore soon before bringing the established nuclear diplomacy back into operation.
Ri described the idea that further sanctions and resistance from the United States would ever force the North into the knee as "Hirngespinst" against a declaration to end the Korean war.
Washington is skeptical and does not want to accept the statement without Pjöngang taking major disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pjöngang is serious about giving up an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pjöngang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris show the latest collections for huge head coverings that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your Hut collection or completely clear the sun, you don't have to search anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed on the run a palette of crazy oversized head coverings for their summer collection 2019 that fascinated the fashion world at the Paris fashion week.
Extremely unpractice huts have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their spectacular creations across the path.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant bicolored hat with a federated wide edge that just pressed the heads of the models.
As other superdimensional accessories, watermelons filled with jewelry, a magic hat and even a pineapple were shown. However, they are not meant to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were fitted with raised lips and had more similarity with Hannibal Lecter than with skin.
One creation resembled a dive equipment, including snorkel and divers, while another looked like a molten iron.
And if you want to make another huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Fashion watchers predict that the huge head coverings could find their way in shopping streets near you.
The over-dimensional huts follow directly to "La Bomba", the 60 cm-wide straw hut, which all carry from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely unpractice hat, which hit large waves in the social media, sent another great creation over the track: a beach bag made of straw, which was almost as big as the model wearing a bath suit that held the bag.
The bass bag in red orange with bast francs and a white leather hook was the prominent piece of Jacquemus' Summer-2019 collection "La Riviera" at the Paris Fashion Week.
Prominent Stylist Luke Armitage said against FEMAIL: “I expect large cottages and beach bags to be available in the shopping streets next summer. The designer has made so much observation that the demand for over-dimensional accessories will hardly be ignored.”
John Edward: Language skills for world citizens essential
Scotland’s independent schools continue to be distinguished by academic excellence. This continued in 2018 with other outstanding test results and is only undermined by individual and joint success in the fields of sport, art, music and other community enterprises.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to support their students and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their students for further education and higher education, their choice and place as a world citizen.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools as electors.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in your own language, you will reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we cannot rely on English only if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current results of this year's review show that languages with the highest existing rates are at the top of the lists of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages achieved note A in the higher examinations.
The data collected by 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students in Mandarin achieved Note A during higher examinations, while 72 percent of students who learned German, 69 percent of students who learned French, and 63 percent of students who learned Spanish also achieved Note A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages today are seen as electives as well as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the teaching plans of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons that employers called for the problems of occupying open places were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly required when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
As more and more open places require languages, these knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future because of such a lifelong ability.
To communicate directly with people from other countries, multilingual people will automatically give rise to competition.
According to a survey by more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct entertainment, and French was spoken as the only language of a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
That is why it is important for children today that we invest in language learning.
Children who speak several languages, in particular languages from developing countries, will have a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the classic modern languages, while other languages will be taught which are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom, for example Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child's interests are concerned, independent schools will always have a number of languages with appropriately specialized teachers to choose.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, as is always the future.
At this time, in a global economic environment, languages cannot be denied as being of fundamental importance to the future of the country. Therefore, this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be regarded as 'international communication capacity'.
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this opportunity of choice, diversity and excellence.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent School.
LeBron before Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James arrive for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is soon over.
Lakers-Trainer Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes will he play, however, is not yet fixed.
"It will be more than one and less than 48", said Walton on the official lakers website.
Laker's reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play just a few minutes.
At the beginning of this week James was asked after training his plans for the six-game pre-season game plan of the lakes.
"I don't need pre-season games in this phase of my career to prepare me," he said.
Weather forecast in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of election campaigns.
This is the first five broadcasts planned by Trump for the next week, including well-informed places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the floating vote on confirming his election to the Supreme Court, Trump would like to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections in November, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress.
When does Trump's announcement take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you view it online?
Trump's announcement in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 (East Coast Time).
You can track Trump's announcement in West Virginia below as livestream on YouTube online.
Trump is likely to address the hearings of the Supreme Court named Brett Kavanaugh on charges of sexual misconduct that were conducted this week in a tense atmosphere. The expected Senate vote on confirmation remains until one week in the wet while the FBI is conducting investigations.
However, the main objective of this series is to support Republicans who have to make difficult choices in a November.
President Trump's election team therefore announced to Reuters that these five broadcasts will serve next week to "mobilize volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to obtain and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives".
"The control of the Congress is so important for its plans that the President will travel in as many states as possible while the operational campaign season is near," said a Trump-voice speaker who did not want to name his name against Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania could participate in the announcement planned for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and reported media from Pittsburgh.
The visit on Saturday is Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, the federal state that he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to support the Republican Senate candidates from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team is ready to fight to maintain hope for the individual on Sunday.
After three rounds on one side, the four parties on Saturday afternoon might have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a pure invention as a sport concept, but one that the players really believe, and that especially in competitions like this.
So where is the moment of her opinion now?
"They were in charge with six points, and now there are four, so I think that this means a little moment for us," said Jordan Spieth when he left the playground.
Europe is, of course, in favour and is ahead of four points, while twelve further follow-up.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day and can present three out of four points each.
Spieth was uninhabitably strong from the end to the green and goes ahead with a good example.
In the course of his round, the Guttural Cheerios became louder than he lowered an important pot to decide the fourth match with four points for both of them after he and Thomas had left after two holes with two points.
His putt, which decided the match on the 15th hole for them, triggered a similar cry that leads to the conclusion that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"I really need to clean up and take care of my own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left of the individual players.
18 To set a sign for evildoers.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have achieved more points than Spieth and Thomas as the only player in the last two days and thus undoubtedly wrote the story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's unequal but sympathetic duo is at four of four points and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was not the only couple who didn't beat Gody on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and on the back nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the apparently flowing energy between them and the released amount of energy undermines that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players to win a possible European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
They prefer to both at the same time at different holes.
Speaking of European fame, however, it would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process with Sergio Garcia, the fourth hero of the morning, who played with Alex Noren.
A Bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spanish and the Sweden into a fold that they could not overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of the trap.
The four and four pairs are based on the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or not give, and the way in which a strategy can quickly change, so fascinatingly from the near side.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and are clearly in charge on the last day. However, this round has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the US, had doubted.
Europe goes on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe is ahead of the fourth and fourth parties from Saturday to the United States at 10:6 and is taking a strong lead in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliant Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two victories over the difficulty-fighting Tiger Woods and was able to book four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjørn, who wanted to win back the Trophies lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated the four of us in the morning against the failed American team and won the show with 3:1.
In the fourth parties, the United States won more resistance and won two matches, but couldn't recover the resistance.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points on the 12th Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood won four consecutive points as the first European newling, while Molinari and Molliwood, who were baptized after a sensational weekend of Molliwood, won only four points as the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they perfectly harmonized and beat the discolored Woods and the American Newling Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5-4-4.
Woods, who had slipped through two matches on Saturday, occasionally let his brilliance shine, but now 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven in sequence.
Justin Rose, who had retired during the four days of the morning, returned and played the four parties as partner of Henrik Stenson. They won 2+1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant day, Paris did not have everything on its own.
The three-time Major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the record for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
In the squares they won a close 2+1 victory over the Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter playing for Spain and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the 4&3 quarters after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it has only occurred twice that a team came back after four points were left in the detail. However, as a headline holder for Fury's team, a decision is enough to keep the trophie.
After only two days in second place, it does not look as if they could start a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral equipment without confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would deepen its suspicions against the United States and that under these circumstances the country would not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said against the annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea had taken "essential measures of good will" last year. For example, it stopped nuclear and rocket testing to dismantle the nuclear sites and committed itself not to increasing nuclear weapons and technologies.
"But we don't see any corresponding reaction from the USA," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances we will not get side by side first."
While Ri confided in North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase-wise" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant when she did not reject unilateral denuclearization from the past, as Pjöngang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an official U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June. In this he had assured Kim to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is aiming at an official end to the Korean war of 1950 to 1953, while the United States has said that Pjöngang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes claims after the closure of the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States consists of "first denuclearization" and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even against the "declaration of the end of war", said Ri.
“The assumption that sanctions can be imposed on us in the knee is a reminder of the people who know nothing about us.
However, the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our suspicions."
Ri did not go into plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. chief of state had highlighted at the beginning of the week with the United Nations.
Instead, at three meetings between Kim and South Korean Chief of State Moon Jae-in in the past five months, the Minister added: “If South Korea were the other party to the denuclearisation issue instead of the United States, it would not have been possible to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.”
However, the tone of Ris spoke differed enormously from his speech last year, when he said that it was inevitable for the UN General Assembly to target North Korea missiles on the mainland of the United States after "the evil President" Trump Kim referred to himself as "Raketenman" on suicide.
This year Trump, who had threatened North Korea with the "complete destruction" last year, praised Kim among the United Nations for his courage in the fight against disarmament. However, he said that there was still much work to be done and that the sanctions should remain in force until North Korea's denuclearization.
On Wednesday Trump said he had no time frame for it: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pjöngang for the steps taken.
On Thursday, however, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must continue vigorously until we have achieved complete, final and verified denouncing."
The Security Council has been unanimously strengthening its sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to finance Pjöngang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri at the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said he will visit Pjöngang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo had already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, when he left Pjöngang, he said that progress had been made to be accused of North Korea only for hours later, he had made "gear-like demands".
North Korea praised this month for meeting with moon, rocket base and a nuclear complex when the United States took "relevant measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" were security guarantees that had given the Trump in Singapore and steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students get more sleep at this year's elementary school. This is a measure against the growing macho culture, stay awake with caffeine and learn about it all night.
One scientist has found that students at the leading university around the world are often unnecessary when it comes to paying attention.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is considered to be the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to call the course into life after giving a lecture on the effects of sleeping tug on learning.
“At last a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I only experiencing it now, in my last year?’
According to her words no one had ever told her how important sleep is. I was surprised," she said to The Telegraph.
This year's course for the first time explained to the students how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance and also improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Business Director of the University's Health Services, said that the University had decided to start the course after she had found that during the week, students had fallen asleep.
The one hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section, the students see the picture of a room in a living room and click on coffee tables, curtains, training shoes and books. They receive information about the effect of caffeine and light as well as the effects of sleep deprivation on sports performance and the importance of sleepiness.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep tuition may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke and cancer.
Then they are encouraged to reflect on their daily routine by means of a map of the university site with interactive symbols.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The pride of moving a "night shift" was still widespread, he said and added that modern technologies and the ever-growing pressure on students made the lack of sleep a growing problem.
In order to ensure good sleep, the "sweet weapon" of all students should be against stress, exhaustion and fear, he said. Furthermore, weight gain could be avoided as sleep training puts the brain in hunger mode, so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler to design the course. In his first year in Harvard, he held one of his courses.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to apply for a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step, all postgraduate students will be invited to complete a similar study program before taking up their studies at the University of Competition.
According to Professor Czeisler, students should wake up for sleep and wake up time and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that comes from electronic screens and LED lighting and can trigger the Circadian rhythm. This leads to problems when sleeping.
Livingston vs. Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor forces Gerard's player
The Rangers lost another outside game when the hit by Dolly Menga for Steven Gerard's unparalleled team meant a 0:1 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to win its first outdoor victory since St. Johnstone's 4:1-triumph, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard to the second defeat in 18 games as manager, so that his team would leave eight points behind the leading hearts in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga met seven minutes before half time, and the inspired Rangers seemed to have no chance to compensate.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third place and is only behind Hibernian at the Tordifference.
In addition, the Rangers are threatened with further trouble after the liner Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury by an object apparently thrown from the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that took over Ayr and reached the half-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stayed with the same eleven Livingstone players who took the hearts one point last week, and must have been thrilled to see how his well-trained team kept their opponents on step and step under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the ball, but Livingston reached more when they had the ball.
They were only supposed to reach a gate in two minutes when Menga's first release led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's gate, but the middle-field player missed his chance and shot.
Then a long release from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner Alan Lithgow was able to pass only on the backpost.
The Rangers took control, but their game seemed more hopeful in the last third than convinced.
Alfredo Morelos was clearly of the opinion that after a quarter-hour, he would have had to be punished because of a collision between him and Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not apply the Colombian complaints.
The Rangers arrived in the first half of the season only two torso, but the former ibrox-torhüter Liam Kelly had little difficulty with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a shot taken by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston hits in the 34th minute may not correspond to the course of the game, it is not to be denied that they had earned him alone for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers could not deal with a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the silence and chose Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerrard acted in half-time and replaced Coulibaly against Ryan Kent. The change showed almost immediate effect when the wing player Morelos put in position, but the impressive Kelly jumped off his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to bring the guests to play exactly the game that is theirs, with Lithgow and Halkett getting a long ball after the other.
Holt's team could have expanded their leadership in the last phase, but McGregor stood well and resisted Jacobs before Lithgow threw a headball out of the corner.
The Rangers exchanger Glenn Middleton also called for a fine soon after a crowd with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
German: The inventor of the geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" German: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as Geiger counter.
Since becoming the standard element of science, geiger counter has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with the apparently unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in all the world is this?"
Rogers: “It is a genomic counter used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you set up these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "Indeed, I hear a knock!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can contribute to the immune system to “see” deformed cells
A new cancer vaccine can contribute to the immune system, to the "see" and to the destruction of deformed cells.
The vaccine will help the immune system to detect detachable cells as part of treatment.
In the method, a patient will receive immune cells that will be modified in the laboratory.
These cells can see a lot of cancer common protein and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that brings the immune system to recognize deformed cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
In the method, an immune cell will be taken away from a patient, which will be modified in the laboratory so that they can see the many types of cancer common protein HER2. Then the cells will be injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promots the growth of various kinds of cancer", including breast, eggstock, lung and intestine cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method for patients taking immune cells and adding them to cancer cells has helped in the treatment of a leukaemia.
Kanye West released a pro-trump trirade after his appearance at SNL and carried a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was blown up at Saturday Night Live in the studio after he had widely praised US President Donald Trump and said he wanted to join 2020 as a presidential candidate.
After singing his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", and wearing a Make-America-Great-Again cap, he went on with a cannon against the Democrats and again stressed his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by whites, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist.”
So if I were to worry about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the mission with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate's Justice Committee on the charges of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West Shipyard has not been sent, it was uploaded by Komicer Chris Rock in social media.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of the publication about West.
West also complained to the public that he had had difficulties behind the stage because of his head covering.
“They have ridiculed me behind the stage.
They said, “Don’t go out with the hat.”
You've fooled me!
And then they say I was in a deranged area," he said to Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see the hidden area?" He said he would "draw my supermancape, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want it to go ahead with the world?
Try it with love."
His comments fired at least twice the calls from the audience, and SNL co-workers seemed painfully affected, Variety reported. One person said to the magazine: “It became silent in the studio.”
West was later obliged to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, Rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a lecture entitled "I Love It", where he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA. She tweeted: “To one of the bravest spirits: DANKE, THAT YOU HAVE REMOVED THE MASSE.”
However, the talk show moderator Karen Hunter tweeted, West was just himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I want someone who, in my opinion, thinks of an ideology that is harmful to my community and who gives himself no reward (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his “art”).
He's free.
The same applies to us." she added.
Before the broadcast, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "The being formally known as Kanye West" (The officially known being as Kanye West).
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dog bore the name Snoop Lion, and of course changed the Prince, the deceased musician, his name in a symbol and then in "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince".

"Game of Thrones" Star Kit Harington Attacked Toxic Manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as the sword of swinging Jon Snow in HBOs of violent medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
The 31-year-old actor, however, attacked the stereotype of the macho hero. He said such roles on the screen would have resulted in boys often having to be strong to be respected.
In a conversation with "The Sunday Times Culture", Harington said he believed that something was wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic humanity in the #MeToo era.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, also 31, who was also involved in “Game of Thrones”, said that the solution to the problem was “very important”.
"I personally find the question very important at the moment, what has been wrong with humanity," he said.
"What have we done with regard to the problem that we are now observing?"
Harington believes that because of the very masculine nature, television may be partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is born, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that the boy gives the feeling that this particular side of a man has to be incorporated?
I think this is really one of the great questions of our time: how do we change this?
Indeed, among the young men, something has gone wrong."
He also said in the interview that after the end of the series he would not participate in prequels or sequels of “Game of Thrones”. He had “a lot of battlefields and horses”.
From November, Harington is seen in a new edition of Sam Shepard's "True West", the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently said that for him the best at "Game of Thrones" was that he had met his wife Rose.
"I've met my wife on this mission, so I've got my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose Leslie played in the Ygritte fantasy series, which was awarded with numerous Emmys, the favorite of Harington's character Jon Snow.
In June 2018 they married Leslie's family members in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported an increase of 14% in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Only around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In contrast to the past, the transfer took place in the majority of the new cases by sex.
Until now, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way was almost reduced to zero, Chinese health officials reported at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, in China, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in 1997 in China, but the discrimination of members of the LGBT community should be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of disease are due to insufficient protection in relation to sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, general access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that employees have secured the data of the GOP senators, criticising "dangerous lies" and "swift theories"
Maxine Waters, Member of the U.S. House of Representatives, opposed to Saturday's allegations, a member of her staff published the personal information of three republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of the MPs.
The Democrat from Los Angeles expressed the view that the claims of “ultra-rights” experts and websites would be disseminated.
"False, lie and even more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information is intended to include the private addresses and telephone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. During the hearing of a Senate committee on the charges of sexual misconduct brought against the Supreme Court candidates Brett Kavanaugh by an unknown person in the government district.
The publication took place after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the contributions was Waters’ Office and published the information of a member of Waters’ Staff, reported The Hill.
"This unwarranted accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were threatened by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for ensuring this information.
This unfounded accusation is absolutely wrong and an absolute lie."
Waters’ statement quickly triggered criticism online, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former press speaker of the White House.
"This Dementi is angry," wrote Fleischer.
“This concludes that she does not have the right temper to be a congressman.
People who are accused of something they have not done may not be angry.
You mustn't be stubborn.
You must not question the defendant's motives.
You must be calm and let go."
Flecher appeared to Waters’ reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of acting too furiously during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, also a Republican candidate who attends the mid-term elections to free water, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing, if that's true," he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and the prosecution authorities of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be taken into account for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff".
Criticism of "Johnny English – You only live three times" – weak spying parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit references in any new British-coloured film. This seems to be true for this re-enactment of the action comedy parody Francis "Johnny English" which began in 2003 with "Johnny English – The Spion that swisted it" and in 2011 with "Johnny English – Now right" again.
Will an ironic self-parody on the subject, as we are obviously concerned, become the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of the globular, grammatical and incompetent Johnny English was extended to massage for the second time. His name indicates more than anything else that it is a general comic creation for cinematographic visitors in the non-English area.
Of course, he is once again the busy secret agent, who is bizarrely cool and world-class, while he actually has contributed to the title melody of "The hour of the winner" at the opening of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In addition, the figure was originally based on the chaos of retired travellers and international secret agents, who played Atkinson in the currently forgotten Barclaycard TV spots.
Johnny English's last adventure has one or two nice moments.
I felt as Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor and the rotor leaves soon hung on his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comics is increasing, but humor seems rather weak and rare, especially because the "serious" films such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" now offer self-evident comedian elements.
The humor seems to be more about children than adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy misconceptions are not as impressive and focused as Atkinson's stupid filmgags in the role of Bean.
The eternal current prize is now that Britain is in great danger.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spynet and revealed the identities of all British agents in use, very to the detriment of the agent in charge, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw helmet for the Prime Minister, a bloated and disturbed figure that is already standing before the full collapse due to her political ill-failure: Emma Thompson gives her best with this Quasi-Teresa-May character, but the script does not give much to her to work with.
Their Secret Service consultants inform them that all active spies have been disbanded and therefore have to get someone out of rest.
This includes the Tolpatschige Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a sendy institution, but there is informal teaching at work as an undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers a "School of Rock" spy academy.
English will be brought back to Whitehall for an emergency discussion and reunited with his former hard-tested Kumpan Bough, which is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a U-boat commander, a nervous woman of the higher society, whose role is somewhat wasted by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin, who always make everything terriblely wrong in your Majesty's secret service, are back in action. They meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful female fatal Ophelia Bullettova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously engaged in the gang of a charismatic tech billionaire, the windows played by Jake Lacy, Jason Volta. He claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain.
English and Bough start their Odyssey of the Great Späße: As a waiter dressed they put on a nice French restaurant in Brand, they make sure of chaos when they smuggle on board Voltas Luxuryyacht, and English dissolves pure anarchy when he tries to make himself familiar with the interior of Voltas House with a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence, all the records are drawn, but so sympathetic and funny is she too, the topic is already being discussed in detail on children's television.
Pretty moderate.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself, "Can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson not play a role that is really right for his talent?"
Labour disputes to work on a plan after which the British work four days a week but are to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corby's Labour Party is going to consider a radical plan that provides that the British work four days a week, but will be paid for five days.
The Party intends to report that business leaders will pass on the savings achieved by the KI revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional free day to the workers.
In order for employees to have a three-day weekend, they would still receive the same payment.
According to sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country to the benefit of the workers.
The shift to a four-day week was promoted by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to benefit from the benefits of the changing economy.
A high - ranking source from the Labour Party said against the Sunday Times: “A directive review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"A change will not occur overnight, but a four-day week's work is an effort that is consistent with the Party's approach to restoring economic balance in favour of workers and the Party's general industrial policy strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first party to defend such an idea. The Green Party already promised during the general campaign 2017 the introduction of a four-day week.
However, the approach is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party said: “A four-day week is not a party policy and is not taken into consideration by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell concreted his presentation last week at the Labour Conference by a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "profit makers" in public supply companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not retain their full share, since a Labour Government could take "deductions" due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the relevant plans to recruit employees in the management of companies and set up Including Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of the equity of private companies to employees who cancel annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy expressed themselves in the press magazine '60 minutes', whether the FBI's investigation in the case of Kavanaugh could change their opinion
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has moved a final vote on his appointment as Judge at the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the results of the Authority could affect the Republican senators in order to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something to an end that could change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I informed in the negotiations that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after, this claim was made, and asked if he had done it.
He was determined, determined and incomprehensible."
However, Graham's voice seems to be measured in stone.
"My opinion stands out what Brett Kavanaugh was about, and it had to be a bomb," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know the following: Brett has fought this very hard,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all those whom she called could not confirm it.”
It's 36 years now.
And I can't see any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and was contributed in this festival to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, in New York, the Global Citizen Festival will be held to fight poverty in the world with an impressive lineup to stars and an equally impressive mission.
Ten thousand will visit the Global Citizen Festival, which will take place this year for the 7th time, to experience not only the performance of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to enhance awareness of the real goal of the event: the fight against extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international group is trying to combat poverty by encouraging more and more people to participate actively in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you need to complete a number of tasks. These include voluntary work, communication with a leading politician worldwide (by email or telephone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal – the fight against poverty.
How successful is the project when you think that Global Citizens remain 12 years to reach the goal?
Is the idea of having a cool free concert in view of a meaningful opportunity to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called cliquetivism – if you think you can change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizens reported that the project has been able to list more than 19 million actions from its supporters since 2011.
These actions are intended to contribute to attract leading politicians from all over the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from their actions, of which at least 10 billion dollars were already paid or purchased by fundraising.
According to the Group's estimates, the funds secured so far have direct effects on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments are the The Power of Nutrition project, a partnership of investors and implementing people based in the United Kingdom who have committed themselves to supporting children in their optimal development and who have promised to help Rwanda with $35 million to combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, following more than 5,000 actions with which Britain was invited to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the The Power of Nutrition project, which is intended to reach 5 million women and children and provide food interventions.
As an answer to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely, the question of why global citizens can fight extreme poverty,
they replied: “It will be a long and intense path with heights and depths.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will have success as we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists who perform at this year's New York event, including Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
The US could use the Navy for blockage purposes to prevent Russian energy exports – Ministry of the Interior
According to Washington Examine, Washington can return to the Navy if necessary, so that energy from Russia does not reach markets including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke told him.
Zinke claimed that Russia's use in Syria is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets. Russia is currently active in inviting the legal government in these areas.
"I think that the real reason for Russia's use in the Middle East is the negotiation of new energy markets, just like in Eastern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are means and ways to approach this.
"The United States can, together with the Navy, ensure that the maritime roads remain open and block them if necessary to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that is understood as "the voice of electricity consumers" in the United States.
He drew a comparison between Washington's practices in dealing with Russia and Iran and found that they were practically identical.
"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia," he said, while Russia was referred to as "One Trick Pony" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements were made when the government was under Trump to expand the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and thus replace Russia with the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
For this purpose, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump Berlin, became a "captive" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline is worth 11 billion US dollars, which should double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres to be an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the massive resistance of Washingtons against the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we are all of the opinion that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure and that consumers can choose their suppliers themselves," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US received a counterwind from Germany that confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has called on the United States to refrain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem when a third country joins in our energy supply," said the BDI Dieter's board of directors after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to "check out a presidential candidate for 2020," says the Senator for Massachusetts
The Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "check carefully" a presidential candidate after the elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidate.
According to The Hill, Warren said it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
After 6 November, Warren plans to examine a presidential candidacy.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump was heading this country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump deals with our democracy," she said.
Warren has not taken a sheet in front of her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that before the vote, of course, an FBI inquiry was needed.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of the Warren elections do not believe they should be candidates for 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts indicated that the senator should not run.
32% of voters supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent who advocated a potential candidacy, and 48 percent who are opposed.
Among the other names of prominent democrats who come to question about a possible candidate 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden told him that he would decide officially by January.
Sarah Palin speaks on the Donald Trump-Ralley for post-traumatic load disorder, under which the Track Palin suffers
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged for domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son can do, what he can when he comes back, can feel all that other families can do to experience the effects of PTBS and some of the wounds that our soldiers return with," she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as an "Elefant in Space" and said about her son and other war veterans that she changed back, that she returned to her relatives, that they came back and wondered if there was this respect in front of what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military had given to the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, says Dan Bennett, a spokesperson of the Police Office of Wasilla.
18 Federal States and D.C. support legal aid for new asylum policy
18 Federal States and the District of Columbia support a legal aid to the new US policy to deny victims of gang activity or domestic violence.
The representatives of the 18 federal states and the district made a statement on Friday in Washington in order to support an asylum-seeker who is in charge of politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace-op-session complaint submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy was not announced.
She said that her partner "and his violent sons" abused them, but US officials refused their asylum application on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors who support Grace called El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the United States as nations that have major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy raised a decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals of 2014, which allowed illegal immigrants on the run from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "is ignored by decades of legislation at the state, state and international level".
"The Federal Act stipulates that all asylum applications are assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application and that this court is in breach of this principle," was stated in the Statement of Judges.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policy, which the immigrants refuse to access to the country, has an adverse effect on the US economy, as immigrants could be more active than entrepreneurs and could provide the necessary workforce.
Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered in June that victims of domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs should no longer be granted asylum.
"Asyl is for all those who leave their home country because they are persecuted or afraid because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a certain social group or political conviction," said the sessions in its announcement of the policy of 11 June.
It was never the plan to eradicate all problems by granting asylum, even all the serious problems that people have to deal with every day worldwide.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu, since the number of victims in the race doubles with time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It's all very busy," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma and calms her little fat son in a rescue center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute a new car comes with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
The inhabitants returned to their ruined houses to collect their wealth and goods and to hide everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the employees of the hospitals, who were damaged by the earthquake with the force of 7.5, were completely overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who raised vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, stayed outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were treated outside because of persistent severe complications.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the terrible earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and his daughter.
"Everything went too fast.
I think I was trapped under the fallen walls," he reported to the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard the help of my wife, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place."
US ambassadors complain to China of the tyranny with "propaganda ads"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper had activated a four-page advertisement in an American daily newspaper announcing the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused the capital of Beijing of exploiting the American press for propaganda.
The United States Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most sold magazine in Iowa, after he accused China of insuming himself in the US Congress elections on 6 November, a charge that China contests.
Trump's allegations that Beijing has tried to intrude into the U.S. elections are consistent with US officials' statement to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign, triggered by Washington, to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to turn off advertising for the promotion of the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an extensive trade war, with duties on imports for both countries.
The Chinese payroll at the beginning of the trade war should meet exporters in countries such as Iowa, who supported the Republican party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, who exports large-scale agricultural products to China, said that Beijing workers, owners of agricultural holdings and businesses had damaged.
China, according to Branstad in an opinion in the Des Moines Registry on Sunday, now doubles this tyranny by triggering propaganda advertisements in its own free press in the United States.
"With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government claims the tradition of free expression and independent press that has been proven in America, by turning off advertising paid by the country in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, you will find only in a limited number of votes at the Beijing newspapers and do not find any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese might have about China’s disturbing economic development, given the fact that the media is firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that one of China's most famous newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article. However, he did not call the name of the newspaper.
Republishing voters before the elections with the debacle around Kavanaugh, observers warn
As many of the most influential Republicans support and defend candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in view of several allegations of sexual violence, observers have warned against a counter-reaction during the upcoming elections, which could in particular arise from women.
The vote in this context was extremely intense, and most Republicans have already stated that they continue with a vote.
"That's not something you can't do," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last minute advance on an FBI investigation would be sufficient to track down angry voters.
"Women don't forget what was yesterday, they didn't forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national speaker for the Progressive Group MoveOn, as the newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators in the Senate's floor area called "November is coming!" when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to hold the Kavanaughs nomination and, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, said Mic.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation were an extremely important issue, shared by Stu Rothenberg, an unbiased political observer on the news page.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not choose."
Even in front of Ford's public statement, in which their allegations of sexual assault against the candidates of the Supreme Court are detailed, observers pointed out that an adverse reaction could be the result if the Republicans submitted the confirmation.
"This situation is a true one for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, NBC News.
"It is not only the vote of the committee, the final vote or the review of Kavanaughs; it is also the way the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have treated it," Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, told a group that supports the election of Democrats to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to disagree who they should believe because of the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly larger share on the side of the latter.
A new survey of YouTube showed that 41% of respondents were definitively or probably convinced by the statement of Ford, while 35% indicated that they were definitively or probably giving Kavanaugh faith.
In addition, 38% claimed that they believed that Kavanaugh had probably or had definitely lied to his statement, while 30% indicated the same over-the-counter.
After the pressure of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford and at least another plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, reported, The Guardian.
Ford made a solemn statement last week before the Senate Justice Committee that she was attacked by the drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had disbanded her genitals when she was at a party during her study in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to oppose Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a market with the aim of establishing a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology legend, imprupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid von Berners-Lee.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee suggested that the intention behind inrupt be the "welthership".
"We need to become active now," he said on the topic of startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology so that users can create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library as well as other tools for the private and business area.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is available in a browser and at the same time.
The special feature of the personal online data storage is that the user can decide for himself who can access the data.
The company refers to this concept as personal data enhancement and development.
According to the CEO of John Bruce, the idea behind the call is that the company uses resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to all.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been set up to work on this project, as well as a community volunteer programmer. Furthermore, a security platform acquired by IBM comes into use.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers can create their own decentralised apps worldwide with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not exchange with Facebook and Google about whether a comprehensive change is to be made where their entire business models are completely redesigned overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a contribution to media released on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee provided a redesign of the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee was involved in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely confident about this new era of the web," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, wearer of the Victorian Cross in the 1st World War, was honored
The only clergy of the Church of England, who was awarded as a champion of the Victorian Cross during the 1st World War, was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Colonel and priest Bernard Vann won the award due to his use of the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
But he was killed four days later by a sharp shooter and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two singles revealed a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Sunday.
One of the enkles, Michael Vann, believed that this act was full of symbolic force, since the monument was revealed exactly 100 years after the Heroes for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Lieutenant Vann led his battalion on 29 September 1918 over the Canal de Saint-Quentin; through dense fog and under fierce protection of cannons and machine guns.
Later he pushed the fireline and led the line forward with the "greatest speed" before he used a field weapon in the Alleingang and turned off three of the military units.
Colonel Vann was shot by a German soldier on October 4, 1918; something more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were something he could never be justified, and at the same time something that would make one humble.
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he placed a skull under the leadership of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band after the parade.
Michael Vann said that he felt very honored to be able to participate in the parade, and added that the bravery of a real hero would be visible, especially by supporting many people.
MMA fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you've been up all night to watch an exciting bellator 206 and then you can't watch the main event.
The San Jose bill included 13 fights, including 6 on the main card, and was broadcast live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just as Gegard Mousesi and Rory MacDonald prepared for their fight, the viewers in the United Kingdom were not shocked to see Peppa Pig suddenly.
Some remained unaffected after they had been awake until early morning to see the battle in particular.
A fan described on Twitter the change to the trick film figure as some kind of bad joke.
“In accordance with a government regulation, these contents are classified as non-young, so that they had to be changed to a child broadcast at 6 p.m.”, said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice-President in the field of marketing and communication with Bellator when asked for the transmission.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
The Board of Directors at Bellator, Scott Coker, announced that the company would be working on the expiry plan in order to take into account future United Kingdom visitors.
"I think that the problem could have been solved in the repeat game," he said.
“But it is 6 a.m. on Sunday morning with the viewers in the United Kingdom, and we will not resolve the event until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we'll stay inside.
The exchange was quite much communicated. It was very nice and it wasn’t always nice.
We have tried to solve the problem, and we have assumed that it is a technical disturbance.
What was not the case was a problem for the government.
I promise, this won't happen again.
We will reduce the whole to 5 instead of 6 fights, as usual, and we have tried to offer the fans the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is quite sad."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels “absolute” when it comes to sexuality
Tom Daley, who took part as a water runner in various Olympic games, says that he grew up with the feeling of being subject to everyone else because of his sexuality. But this feeling had motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old felt that he only realized at the next school that he was different from others.
In the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke on the subject of right of swearing to encourage others.
He also thought that since he became a father, victory in the Olympics was no longer so important to him.
The real moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses illness for a few months.
In his first mission to Laverne, he said that he had earlier considered himself to be inferior to others, since love for boys and girls was socially unacceptable.
He said: “To this day, it is the feeling of subjecting others and being different from others, reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success.”
He wanted to prove that he was a very special person to disappoint no one when his sexual orientation was known.
The double bronze medal winner at the Olympics is today a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to promote the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said that he had spoken on this subject because he was fortunately able to live without restrictions and without discrimination and wanted to make others courageous.
The three-time world champion fell in love with the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The realization of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner in the previous year, but he said that the age difference had never been a topic.
He believes that if you had to spend so much as a child and youth – he took part in the Olympics for the first time 14 years and his father died three years later in cancer, it is hard to find someone at the same age with similar experiences.
Since June, the couple has had a son who bears the name Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley believes that his whole view has changed since then.
Last year, everything was about gold medals.
But for him there are now more important than Olympia gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main winner.
He bears the same names as his father Robert, who died at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the imminent death, and one of the last things he asked about was the tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be with it right ahead.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there anymore," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after that I finally realized that he was not invincible," he continued.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
“I only knew that it was always my dream to dive in the Olympics before the local public – that was crazy,” he said.
His first song selection – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced by this. He heard the song in front of the Olympics and still took care of the whole skin.

Mickelson, who is currently not in shape, sits at the Ryder Cup on Saturday at the replacement bank
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record at his 47th Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he has to work very hard not to get the whole thing into a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays at the event for the 12th time, was sent to the replacement bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of standing at the centre of the event as usual, the five-year-old Major spent his day fireing others and working at his game, hoping to solve the problems he was facing.
Even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old Mikkelson was never the directest golfer and thus no ideal occupation for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where missing balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself wasn't enough to be disillusioned, Mikkelson meets in the ninth game on Sunday at the perfectist British Open-Champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood, Newling at these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans with four points remained in the 12 individual games a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove to be absolutely decisive.
Furyk spoke with confidence about Mickelson and could not add much to it either.
"He was completely about his role today in the clear, gave me a clip on my back and laid his arm around me and thought he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has quite a lot of confidence in himself.
He is one of the known personalities around the world and has done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't think he was in two games.
I had imagined more, but that's how it's been, and that's what we've been expecting.
He wants to be like everyone else."
Mickelson will reach Nick Faldos record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup track that never fully matched the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson can record 18 victories, had 20 defeats and reached seven half-times, although Furyk announced that his presence alone had enriched the team.
"He's funny and sarcastic, original and he likes to make some jokes, and he's a great man who's popular with the whole team," he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him this week. It was fun to watch them.
He's a really interesting person who gives a lot of impulse."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that it can be over with the lead soon
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advance that leads to the last individual games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The dance debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seven Ballesteros had a lead of five points against the Americans, but only barely crossed the finish line and went in the lead with the smallest possible lead and won a victory of 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
“The thought remains that we had a great lead in Valderrama, we had a great lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we have won, but it’s only short,” said Bjørn (recorded in the photo), after he had seen the victory 5–3 of the Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10–6 at Le Golf National.
Experience shows me and all the team members that it's not over.
It's gonna be okay tomorrow.
Put yourself in the line and do exactly the right thing.
The whole is only over when the points are on the display table.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and right there is our focus.
I've always said that I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're totally in the process of explaining what's happening to us on the other side: the best players in the world."
Joy over the performance of his players on a difficult golf course continued Bjorn: “I would never miss it.
Tomorrow's gonna be another caliber.
Tomorrow the individual benefits are at the forefront and this is a completely different thing.
It's great to work with a partner when things go well, but if you're alone out there, then you'll be tested to the limits of his ability as a golfer.
You have to make this clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will notice that his players cut each one better than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of that big turnout on the last day of the tournament. He stood in Brooklyn on the winning side before he stood on the side of the losers after Europe's "Wonder of Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question as Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to withdraw the quick start you saw in Brooklyn and in Medina.
When the moment hits in a direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send out our boys as we feel, you know, we're trying to drive tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to take the challenge, he has to join Rory McIlroy in the top-play against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the upper half of the ranking.
"I have decided for the boys in this order because I think it covers everything," said Bjorn about his selection for the individual meetings.
Germany's new warship is delayed again
The latest German Navy frigates were to be put in service in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War that came in the years. However, it will be delivered, according to local media, due to faulty systems and fast growing costs only next year.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leader of the brand-new frigates of the "Baden-Württemberg" class, has now been moved to the first half of 2019, according to the time it came to a military speaker.
The ship would have been put into service already in 2014, but the ambitious project of worrying problems after delivery was scheduled.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
They are intended to contain a powerful cannon, a series of rockets and marine target aircraft, as well as tar technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic flexion.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the continued delays can lead to the ageing of the highly modern warships to be represented by Germany as a maritime vessel at the time of their deployment, says The Time.
The F125 Fragatt who was followed by the accident ran into the battle lines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to take off the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss station in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship after its delivery to the shipyard.
There was little information about the reasons for the return, however, German media called a number of significant "software and hardware errors", which made the new ship useless in a fighting situation.
Software problems are particularly serious as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are served by a crew of only 120 mattresses, only about half as many as on the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the ship is too heavy, which leads to performance gains and prevents the Navy from carrying out equipment measures in the future.
The 7000 tonnes of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" was apparently twice as heavy as ships with a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the whole project, including the training costs of the occupation, became a problem.
The cost seems to have risen to €3.1 billion compared to the originally planned €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly important in view of the latest warnings that the German Navy is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German Bundestag's Weaver Commander, confirmed that the Navy "is out of service".
Bartels said that the problem with the time got bigger as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be removed from the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
In an estate in the Scottish Highlands, new research works are being carried out to show how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the results will allow further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will help guide future nature conservation activities.
The study carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will be aimed at Zwerg and Mückenfädermuseums as well as the Brown Langohr and Waterfädermuseums in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are mounted at key positions on the plot to record the activities of bats throughout the whole season.
Employees of the NHS and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys with portable detectors.
In an analysis of the noise of all the recordings by experts, the frequency of the butterfly calls is determined and determined which species does what.
Then a map and a report of the living space will be drawn up to create a detailed picture of its behaviour at landscape level.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Adviser for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of life are most important for the bats and how they are used by each species.
These data will help determine the benefits of the measures to manage the living space, such as the creation of sights, and show how to obtain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Flemish stocks in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that affect sleeping places and lead to the loss of living space.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flyers and the chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Fledermouses are not really blind.
However, because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use an incorrect echolocation to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland takes the theme of bats very seriously.
He has 10 trained experts who carry out regular surveys, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue measures.
The organisation even set up Scotland's first and only bat reserve in Thrave's estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's 10 bat species.
Good Manager David Thompson explains that the existence of the ideal living space is for her.
"Here in Thrave we have a great area for bats," he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent living space.
But there are many things that we do not yet know about bats, so here and on other goods we do these works that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel well."
He stressed how important it was to exclude the presence of bats before maintenance work in the goods first, since it was possible that the unintentional destruction of a single nest site would kill up to 400 females and young animals and wipe out the entire population on site.
Flemish mice are under protection and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the people to help.
She explains: “We still have to learn a lot about bats and in many of our species we don’t know how they are about their populations.”
Ronaldo argues about rape while his lawyers want to report the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo referred to the allegations of rape raised against him as “Fake News” and said that people want to “be famous” by using his name.
His lawyers plan to report the news magazine The mirror that published the charges.
The stormer of the national team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of rapeing an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid her $375.000 to buy her silence on the occasion, says The Mirror on Friday.
In an Instagram live video to his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports only hours after their release as “Fake News”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News," said the five-time winner of the Ballon d’Or to the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," added the player laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to report the mirror on the grounds of the allegations they refer to as "inadmissible reporting on suspicions in the field of privacy" according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player demanded a compensation for “moral damage in an amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged event was to take place in 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped them according to documents submitted by the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to the knees after the alleged incident and she said he was "99 percent good guy", who was "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that both had sex, but say it was conceivable.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later admitted to an extrajudicial agreement because she had “a fear of compensation” and made sure to be “publicly humiliated”.
The 34-year-old said that she was now trying to withdraw the agreement because she was still traumatized because of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was at the time of the alleged incident shortly before he moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid and changed this summer into a 100 million euros heavy deal to the Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would “repent” the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "never regret it" if after Brexit it lost its status as a world-leading manufacturer of cars, says Minister of Economic Affairs Greg Clark.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production in the work in Burnaston near Derby, Britain should leave the EU.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the influence of delays on the border could lead to job losses in a no-deal-brexit.
The work in Burnaston, in which Toyotas production lines Auris and Avensis produced almost 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I am convinced that we will experience production stops at an uncontrollable Brexit at the end of March," says Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyotas in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a tough EU exit without agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW says, for example, that it will close its mini-work in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
According to the car manufacturers, the main concerns are linked to risks within the supply chain with a hard Brexit.
Toyotas manufacturing plant is operated on a "just-in-time" basis. This means that the parts are delivered from both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes to make the cars on order.
Should the United Kingdom leave the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be interruptions which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and bottlenecks in the parts.
It was not possible for Toyota to carry a stock in the work in Derbyshire which lasted longer than one day, the company explained why production had to be interrupted.
Clark explained that Theresa Mays Chequers' plan on future relations with the EU is "precisely designed to avoid such border controls".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that allows us, as I said before, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he explained in the BBC Radio 4 today.
"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far."
Toyota could not indicate how long the production had to be interrupted, but warned in the long term that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the work and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest official in the United Nations, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience will never return these jobs once they are gone.
One government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump-planned meetings with Rosenstein could be moved again according to White House data
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "moved for another week", while the dispute over the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued, was called from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein has been overseeing the work of Special Envoy Robert Mueller, who investigates the election mixes through Russia, links between Trump's advisors and Russia, and possible injustices by the President.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Deputy Justice Minister and thereby endanger the independence of Mueller has been the subject of allegations in Washington for a month.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein called for the opportunity to record his secret talks with Trump as well as the President's resignation with the 25th constitutional addition.
Rosenstein dismissed the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports of his alleged resignation were made known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was then held at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced for the coming Thursday,
Trump explained that he would not let it go Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to prevent it from collaborating with the hearing before the U.S. Senate's Justice Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had abused him, said.
On Friday, Trump arranged a one-week FBI investigation of the allegations against Kavanaugh, leading to further delays in the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press spokesman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When she asked a question about meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “A date has not yet been set for this. It could be this week, but I can still imagine that it will be moved in another week, given all the things that are just going ahead with the Supreme Court.
This will show. But I always like to keep the press on the run."
Some reporters would probably object to this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of press conferences was not based on a deviation from the "effect harassment" of TV reporters, but he said: "But I would not argue that they operate effect harassment."
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President is making more questions and answers rounds than any president before him," she said without giving precise proof: "We have seen these figures."
There will still be press conferences, says Sanders, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly but to speak to me far better than I do.
We try to do this often and you have seen that we have done this often in the last few weeks. This will take the place of the press conference if you can speak with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions if he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visitors.
Press conferences with him are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is the case when he refused to perform a bizarre act in front of the reporters.
Minister of Health writes about Brexit's concerns to EU employees of the Scottish NHS
The Minister of Health draws attention to persons from abroad working in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and to express the wish that they will remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already declared itself ready to bear the costs of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service of Scotland.
In your letter, Freeman wrote: “In the course of the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU were continued and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the British government has also strengthened preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I'm aware of what disturbing times this must be for you all.
That is why I would like to express once again how much I value the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues and colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is full and full of your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here."
Christian Abercrombie was subjected to a head injury after a not surgery
The linebacker of Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie was subjected to a notop operation, according to reports by Mike Organ of Tennessee State, after a head injury that he suffered on Saturday at the 31-27 defeat against Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, explained to reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-life break.
"He came to the page line and just broke up there," Reed said.
Trainer and medical staff provided Abercrombie on the oxygen line before being placed on a leash and transported for further investigations.
A spokesperson from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville,Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the opera in the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details about the nature or extent of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called Redshirt, plays at Tennessee State in its first season after changing from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he listed 5 pickles in total, thus increasing his total number in the season to 18 pickles.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom
Foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp tax in the future for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom.
This step is intended to slow down the success of Jeremy Corby's campaign for young voters
The increase in stamp duty will apply to all persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance estimates a further revenue of up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors must pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the United Kingdom, with the benefit of multiple revenues without cover.
This step is an attempt to slow down Jeremy Corby's success with young voters, which promises to provide more affordable living space and to take top earners into the viewer.
The increase in stamp tax will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
In addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase in residential property abandoned to two years ago and for rent, it could amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance is counting by the step with multiple revenue of up to 120 million pounds per year.
Estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by investors who are not in the United Kingdom. This leads to price increases and it is harder for first-time buyers to take foot in the real estate business.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital city, have become "spirit cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers, which spend most of their time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson spoke of reducing stamp tax to allow more young people to first own.
He accused construction companies of raising their real estate prices by buying land without using it, and he urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable apartments to end British housing scandal."
The opposition leader Corbyn announced a spectacular series of proposals for residential reforms ranging from a rental price bond to the prohibition of rooms without any cause.
He also wants to grant city councils more powers in the construction of new apartments.
May stated: “Last year, I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister of the Recovery of the British Dream, according to which the life of generation should be better for generation.
And that means repairing our broken apartment market.
Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it cannot be true that it is as easy for people who do not live in Britain as it is for companies based abroad to buy real estate as it is for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of the home has become too far away for too many people and the worthlessness of opacity remains too big a problem."
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says that it was his “largest goal” to ever become the manager of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Scottish enjoys the challenge of raising a new life for the association from the north-east of England, which is just in the third place in the League One and is missing three points at the top.
He took this summer to the stadium of Light after taking St. Mirren back to the first Scottish league in the last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made it to the bank and it was," said Ross of BBC Scotland's sports sound.
“But I’ve seen as a child playing with my father often Scotland in Hampden and that’s something that always pulls me back.
However, this possibility would only come if I were successful in the management of the association."
Ross predecessors in the role as manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic said not to be afraid to step into such established names at such a club after he had previously refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured at the moment if I can bring the club back to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and possibilities of this association, he is undoubtedly a member of the Premier League," he explained.
“It is not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably consider my time here only as a success if I brought the club back there.”
Ross can present a first three-year management career, after a stage as deputy chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month activity as coach in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from religion to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of religion to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says he now feels better than ever before in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"That was probably a real route," he recalls when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really believe that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds funny because I didn't get a bad job, I was able to live well of it, and I experienced some very pleasant high phases.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to do every week.
I'm still doing this with regard to stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I do it. I've never felt so well in my skin as an adult in my whole life."

The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 17:30, according to a study
The heat wave in the summer has missed a rise in the revenues of British crystalline pubs, while restaurant chains run under greater pressure.
Pub and bar companies recorded an increase in sales of 2.7 per cent in July. However, the revenues at the restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the company council CGA, which compiled the figures, explained: “Sustained sunscreen and England longer than expected permanent participation in the football world championship meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June, in which Pub’s sales increased by 2.8 percent. However, the restaurant found it even more difficult.
The fall of 1.8 percent, recorded by the restaurant industry in June, continued in July.
Pubs and bars with focus on drinks showed the best performance at a distance, with a surface-adjusted sales development that rose higher than they dropped at the restaurants.
Pubs with emphasis on food also left in the sun, but not as drastic as the restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, the rates of drinking increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while the food paragraph decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, from the analysts for the leisure and hospitality RSM, explained: “These results continue the trend that we have been able to observe since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still struggling with problems, but sales revenues of 4.8 per cent will be particularly painful in addition to the ongoing cost pressure compared with the previous year.
The long, hot summer could not have come at any worse time for operators of companies with emphasis on food and it remains to be expected that the more appropriate temperatures will be provided with the urgently needed rest period in August."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the decline in the brand-rollouts.
The industry sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the United Kingdom with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds and is the recognised industry benchmark.
One of five children has secret accounts in social media that hide it from his parents
A study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keep it secret from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students in further schools has shown an increase in so-called 'Fake Insta' pages
The message indicates that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students indicated that they had a "main account" to show their parents
One of five children, some just 11 years old, creates social media accounts that can keep them secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in further schools showed a rapid increase in so-called "Fake Insta" accounts, a loan to the Photo-Sharing Website Instagram.
The message suggests that sexual content is shared.
Twenty percent of the students decided to have a clean "main account" that they could show their parents, but also to have private accounts.
A mother who was standing on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged the other to "violence me."
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, with half of them having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of the HMC, said: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers are being seduced into creating online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Elid Doyle will be “Voice of the athletes” in the Scottish Sports Council
Elid Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Association's Scottish Athletics Council at its annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most outstanding lightweight athlete and President Ian Beattie described the choice as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
“Eilid is respected in the Scottish, UK and the world’s Light Athletics Community and we are sure that the Light Athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from their election to the Council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I look forward to acting as a voice of athletes and hoping that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won over 200 and 400 meters in 1996 at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, called his own four Olympic gold medals, and today often appears as BBC experts, could no longer run after a previous breakthrough.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't run anymore.
The doctors say no one can tell if or how far I'm going to be healed.
It was hard work, but I recovered completely, learned to run again and make mobility exercises today!
Thank you very much for the encouraging news!"
An advertising for milk pumps that compare mothers to cows ensures excitement in the network
A manufacturer of milk pumps ensured excitement in the network with a advertising clip in which silent mothers are compared to cows' milk.
In order to introduce the market, according to its own specification, "the first soundproof milk pump" published by the producers of consumer technology Elvie a non-serious music video to highlight the freedom that the pump gives to silent mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a cow-filled barn with cows in the background to a song that contains the text lines like: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see a cock at me" or "if you haven't noticed it, it's not yours but my breasts."
In the refrain it goes on to say: “Pump it out, pump it out, feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies.”
However, the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page has triggered a controversy on the network.
With 77,000 attacks and hundreds of comments, the video appeared on mixed reactions in the viewers, many of whom say it does not harm the "fears" of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to apply for this product with cows.
As we do, they have to be pregnant and produce a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys are taken away within a few days after their birth," said a comment.
Elvie's milk pump fits gently into a still-BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “Traditionally traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to apply a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: “So a reality-stranged advertising.”
Others defended the advertising and a woman said you found the song "urcomic".
“I think it’s a great idea.
I would have bought one if I were still quiet.
When I was pumping, I felt just like a cow.
The clip's a little crazy, but I'm not trying to reinterpret it.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one person.
Another person commented: "This is a funny advertising aimed at mothers using milk pumps (often at work or in toilets) and feel like "big".
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone danced with the discreet pumps in their BHs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women using milk pumps indicate how to feel like dairy cows.
However, the pump of Elvie is completely noiseless, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a quiet-BH, making women free to move to keep their babies or even to leave during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, explained: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative market introduction.
By comparing silent mothers with milk cows, we wanted to raise milk pumps and all the challenges that come with this, and at the same time in a entertaining and representative way to present the incredible feeling of freedom that allows the new pump.
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump runs into the battle lines.
During the London Fashion Week, a double mother appeared for designer Marta Jakubowski on the catwalk, while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were brought to a tent on the Texan border
The number of internally displaced children is as high as ever, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively the same, including the increased rhetoric and measures of the Trump government have made it more difficult to bring children to the caretakers.
Traditionally, most immigrants themselves were illegal immigrants, and now they are afraid to become the target disc for an exhibition when they sign up to take up a child.
The risk increased in June when the Federal authorities announced that potential operators and other adult members of their household should print their fingerprints and share this data with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Customs Immigration and Customs Enforcement, announced before the Congress that the Authority arrested dozens of people who had claimed the care of unaccompanied minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees did not have previous entries in the criminal register.
“Almost 80 percent of the persons who are either self-employed or a member of a household of a nurse are illegally detained in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
That is why we will continue to pursue these people," said Albence.
In order to be able to handle children's cases more quickly, officials introduced new rules requiring, according to the staff of the accommodation in some children, to appear within a month rather than 60 days after the entry into court, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear by video recording and not personally to appear before an immigration judge for their legal status.
In the case of negative decisions, the person is quickly dismissed.
The longer these children remain safe, the more likely it is, according to information from the accommodation workers and reports that have been reported from the system in the last month, that they are afraid and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or outbreaks.
Defenders say that these concerns are reinforced with a larger facility such as Tornillo, as there are indications that a child has problems, due to the size, are more easily overlooked.
They also explained that traumata, which many of the children are already suffering, could be strengthened if they are brought into a tent without emotional preparation or sufficient time to settle with friends.
Syria calls on American, French and Turkish “Employment troops” to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's civil war is now in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on the Syrian soil against the forefront of the fight against terrorism and were "treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war against terrorism almost passed" was in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus "will continue to fight this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed" by both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has deployed some 2000 troops in Syria to train and advise mainly Kurdish fighters and Syrian Arabs who are employed against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 ground troops in the war-based country.
As for the refugees, Moualem explained that the conditions were given for their return and he accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears", leaving the refugees at home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to enable homecoming," he said.
"They are actually politicising a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that no building aid would be granted to Syria unless there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats explained that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel capital Idlib provides the opportunity for pre-emption of political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a wide-ranging offensive of the Syrian troops supported by Russia into the province in which three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military action against the Djihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, would be carried out.
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee, which consists of government and opposition members, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem referred to the conditions of the Syrian Government for its participation in the Committee and stated that its work should be limited to "recasting the articles of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win his reelection
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal observers are likely to hope, close his presidency in advance or a scandal.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all time".
So far, there's no sign that the audience was there.
Since 2014, the transmission rates for the best transmission time at CNN have doubled to 1.05 million and almost doubled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million viewers for the best broadcast time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBCs "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the activation rates with only 3.5 million viewers at evenings with important news.
"It's like a fire that attracts people magically, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Bear, Showrunner, the "Designated Survival" drama series on TV channel ABC, about a cabinet member who will be president after an attack destroys the chapter.
Nell Scovell, an old-fashioned Comedy writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club" has another theory.
She recalls a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd choose Trump.
She asked him why.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh’”” told me Scovell.
Chaos is worth entertainment.
Of course, the stories from Washington can, in contrast to all that is on television, determine the future of the principle decision on deductions Roe v. Wade, the possible integration of families and the health of the global economy.
The disablement is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it is also about being an informed citizen when one realizes having already looked at six hours of an expert round that over Bob Woodwards uses sources from the so-called "Deep Background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 expensive bomber jacket from Strausten leather (according to Washington Post, a piece of clothing rich in self-esteem) or discussing the effects of Stormy Daniel's traveling description of Trump, amm, anatomy.
For my part, Super Mario will never be able to see again with the same eyes.
“A part of what he does can feel like a reality show he holds every evening,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series “The Three of the Pfandhaus”, about Trump’s rotating occupation and daily performances (a fight with the football league NFL from the Zaun, Kim Jong-un prizes).
You can't afford to miss a consequence, or you can't come with it anymore.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sundial 27 degrees before his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he stole inside and looked at MSNBC while recording CNN at the same time.
He simply could not get rid of the screen unless Brett Kavanaugh, a judge's candidate, stood before the Senate's Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we did all these crazy missions at the time and the people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turned out that they were right."

Donations of cash flow through the narrowest races around congress seats at the intermediate elections
It is not surprising that the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania is being flooded by donations thanks to the newly drawn boundaries of the electoral district, which led to two officials running around the same seat.
The recently re-designed suburban Bezirk in Pittsburgh will allow the Democratic Connor Lamb to join, who won his seat in another district in the course of a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb is opposed to another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is strongly intertwined with the new 17th district.
The maps were re-drawed after the Supreme Court of the State of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old areas were against the Constitution and were manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered an exchange of voter funding between the parties' large financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a highly observed special election in March around the 18th district of the state.
This seat was held over a decade by a Republican and Trump won 20 percentage points there.
Politician experts provide the Democrats with an easy leadership.
The United States examined El Salvador's punishment for its support for China, but then turned back
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized, without encountering great resistance from Washington.
Trump completed a friendly meeting in June 2017 with President Juan Carlos Valero and held a hotel in Panama to partner the management team of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to withdraw the heads of all US overseas missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore", said Heather Nauert, Minister's spokesman in an opinion at the beginning of the month.
However, only in El Salvador's case was considered criminal measures estimated at $140 million in 2017 for U.S. aid, including for drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed criminal measures, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder.
While internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials moved a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which should follow a similar meeting in the previous year and represent a step forward in efforts to stop migrants from moving towards the United States.
However, in mid-September, high government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and thus effectively ended the consideration of El Salvador's criminal measures.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled as a speaker at the conference in mid-October to give a sign of importance to the government of the assembly, according to diplomats.
The three American diplomatic representatives are silent and silent back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new sharp messages or sanctions from Washington.
A speaker from John Bolton rejected an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to speak on the basis of the anonymity of the internal discussions.
Their opinions were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next major surprise could be the report by Special Agent Robert Mueller on Trump's possible injustice for which there is now sufficient evidence in the public.
Mueller is now allegedly also investigating whether Trump's election team has conspired with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
Should the majority of congresses change, Trump is confronted with an organ that forces him to take account of, precisely at the time when he prepares to come back to the electors; and perhaps before a jury.
These are many “whens” and I do not want to say that the Donald Trumps case, or the European pendant, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must make decisions that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were willing to carry out a state strike against Hitler if the West had only resisted him and supported the Czechoslovak in Munich.
We have failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of the barbarians who followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the relentless march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing several such turning points.
What do we do when Trump dismisses Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides about the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein ran into the kitchen of the devil since last year reported that he proposed to record the president secretly and speculated about it, however inappropriate for the office.
Rosenstein detracts from the New York Times.
“How will we respond if the newly ordered FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or is confirmed in spite of credible allegations of sexual abuse and misappropriation in the office?
And above all, are we going to vote in the interim elections for a congress that forces the Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, we will have a long winter ahead.
But I think we're not going to lose because of what I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz from the same regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me off 60 years later to light up Sabbath candles on the table with the crochet cross.

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers optimistic ahead of the game against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Wien on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive Remis against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will put them in a good position for the qualification of the Group G of the Europa League.
As a result of a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not get into appearance until 2-2 level against Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a jumpboard for larger ones.
"That was an important point for us because Villareal is very good," said the 31-year-old.
We've gone into the game with the conviction that we can do something about it and we're headed home with a point.
Maybe we could still win at the end, but in total an undecided was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we worked in the second half and were then the better team.
Thursday will be another great European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, however, this will be a difficult party as they have achieved a good result in the last game. But I am sure that we can go through it with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of feeling factor.
The team is good and the boys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind and be successful."
Fear of age care leads women to sleepless nights.
Although the surveyers knew exactly how to care for them, only a few spoke to their family members.
About half of the participants in the nationwide study agreed to talk to your spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent agreed to talk to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but don't take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Insurance Department.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not express your wishes in time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you want to be treated, as these decisions can be an important factor in determining the costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: Your consultant can also help you to find an opportunity to finance these expenditures.
Your financial decisions for long-term care can include traditional care insurance, hybrid life-forming capital insurance to help cover these costs or self-assurance with your own assets - as long as they have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Use legal disputes in the last minute.
Set up a precautionary authority so that you order a trusted person to monitor your medical care and to ensure that health professionals comply with your wishes, you should be exempt from expressing them yourself.
Consider also a full power for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about taking medicines or allergies?
Note these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"Not only financial questions play a role. Who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What is the drug treatment?"
Who cares about the dog?

Men in Ilfracombe fought several times with air weapons
A man was shot several times with a gun when he went home after work among friends.
The victim, a man in the quarters, was located in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
Officials describe the shots that were suitable for about 02:30 British times as "willing act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries were not life threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, as the authorities said. The number of dead could still rise.
Due to the outbound communication systems, aid forces were unable to obtain information from the Dongala government district, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a force of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunamis took place.
Donghala is a county located in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi, located over 300 km (180 miles) long.
In the government district, a unit of administration under the province, 299,200 people lived in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income from the Central-Sulawesis economy, in particular the Dongala coastal region.
The construction of Nickellab is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
Palu and Dongala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis, according to the Indonesian disaster protection authority in the last 100 years.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
In 1996, West Dongala was hit by a tsunami with nine people dying.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Fire ring, and is regularly haunted by earthquakes.
Here are some of the greatest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and cost the lives of 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra between the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 shook the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed nearly 700 deaths.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a force of 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai islands in front of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A slight earthquake shocked the government district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died from the collapse of buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the popular Indonesian island of Lombok and called for over 500 deaths on the north side of the island.
The siege destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily beached on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested because of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor Alaska and former candidates for the office of vice president, was arrested on the grounds of allegations of injury.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspecting domestic violence, preventing the reporting of domestic violence and resistance to State violence, a report published by the Alaska Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he picked up the phone when he wanted to understand the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is under investigation in the Mat-Su Pretral Facility and a deposit of $500 was raised.
He appeared on Saturday before the court, where he, when asked for his petitioner, replied with "not guilty, absolutely sure", according to the network.
Palin will be accused of having suffered three disorder of Class A, which can be treated with up to one year of imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B disorder that can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time that Palin's convictions have been raised.
In December 2017 he was asked to attack his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is dealt with in advance of the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was subjected to domestic violence, reports of crime and possession of weapons under the influence of drugs in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend told him you'd beat her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veterans' organisations in 2016 after bringing her son’s behavior back to post-traumatic load disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that shocked the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
With a strength of 7.5, the quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Power and communication networks are interrupted and it is expected that the number of deaths will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just ahead of the Central-Sulawesis coast, located north-east of the capital of Indonesia Jakarta.
On the social networks, videos are circulating from the time the wave hit the ground.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Court of Justice rarely calls for death penalty for suspects in New Yorker terror attack
The federal court in New York calls for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the accused in the terrorist attack of New York City, which cost eight lives. This is a rare penalty that has been suspended for a federal crime since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of using a rented pick-up of the building market chain Home Depot for a terrorist attack, in the course of which he rode on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October and was transporting pedestrians and cyclists.
For the purpose of justifying the death penalty, the plaintiffs must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "targeted" and "consciously" added serious bodily injuries, as stated in the statement of intent for the claim of the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punishable by death, according to the case-law.
Weeks after the attack, a Federal Inquisitor Saipov filed an indictment in 22 points covering eight counts of the murder in front of organised crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as an accusation of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for 'fundamental planning and purpose', the plaintiffs who described the way in which Saipov carried out the act as 'disgusting, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov added to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage, pain and loss," said the explanation.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For more than a decade, the southern district of New York has not pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers and was finally sentenced to a life-long imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in New York at a federal crime was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been guilty of two years before the conspiracy to commit spying on the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were installed on 19 June 1953 with the electric chair.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, testified in the days and months following the attack of missing Reue, according to court documents.
He told investigators to feel good about what he did, so the police.
Saipov explained to the authorities that he was actually inspired after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also called on the police to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He declared himself innocent in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, explained that they were “of course disappointed” by the decision of the state prosecutor.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of a debt in exchange for a life-long release penalty without the possibility of accepting the trauma that will only extend to all the parties involved”, Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously requested the charge not to demand the death penalty.
A Member of the Conservative Party asks NIGEL FARAGE to transfer the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize "the power of the people" today during a protest at the Tories conference.
Ukip's former leader stated that politicians "must feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics, while a Member of Theresa Mays Party suggested that Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative banker Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would already be outside" if Farage Brexit was Minister.
The challenge facing May in reconciling its deeply disputed party was reinforced by the fact that members of your party who are for a stay in the EU took part in a separate demonstration against Brexit, which took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems keeping her compromise plan in spite of attacks by Brexit advocates, Brexit opponents and the EU on course.
They insisted that, despite the counter-reactions, they continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels and thus force Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to decide between their package and the Chaos.
Bone explained on the “Leave Means Leave” demonstration in Solihull that “Checkers belong to the garbage”.
He suggested that a Farage should have been mentioned to a peer and that he be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were responsible, we would already be outside,” he explained.
Wellingborough said, “I’ll stand up for Brexit, but checkers belong to the garbage.”
He stressed his opposition to the EU: 'We have not fought in world wars to be subversive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected allegations that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and now want to stay in the EU is totally wrong’.
Brexit's assistant of Conservative Andrea Jenkins was also on the demonstration and explained reporters: ‘I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘The compromise is unfavorable in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unfavorable in our own party and with our activists who actually go through the streets and make sure that we are elected.
Please give up checks and start listening.’
In a clear message to May, she continued: ‘The Prime Minister keeps his jobs when you keep his promises.’
Farage stated in a statement that politicians need to “taste the pressure”, they should be right in deceiving the decision of the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class”, said Farage.
“They are trying to cheat the Brexit and therefore we are here today to say to them, ‘You will not come from it’.
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he continued: ‘I want you to let our political class, which is just before betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We will mobilize the power of the people of this country, which will help us to victory in the referendum and never come to rest until we are an independent, self-restraint, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before they held a two-hour broadcast in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners from the Tories Against Brexit Grouping, a group of Brexit opponents within the May party, which was called to life at the weekend.
Lord Adonis, Peer of the Labour Party, was making fun of the Tories who had security problems with a party app when the conference was opened.
“These are the people who tell us that they can make sure that the IT systems, like all the technology for Canada Plus, for the seamless frontiers, are available for free trade without frontiers in Ireland,” says Adonis.
‘That's a farce.
There's just no good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to “check exactly” the presidential candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren explained that after the elections in November, she would "examine the presidential candidacy precisely".
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a prominent critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race to re-election for the Senate against the Republican MPs in the Parliament of Massachusetts Geoff Diehl, who was Vice-President of Trump's election team in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was the focus of speculation that it could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke has been her 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump's arrival.
One of the people present asked her if you would like to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that for women at the time it would be "to go to Washington and repair our broken government and this includes women at the top."

The Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested from Friday in the case of the deadly shots on LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.

Great prize from Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after his team has left him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time that Valtteri Bottas landed on Saturday in qualifying before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Stalllord of Mercedes would play a major role in the race.
From the Pole position of Botta's success a good start and it was almost as he led Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel went into the box first and let Hamilton come into traffic at the end of the driver’s field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went a round later into the box and landed behind the Vettel, but he caught Hamilton after a short wheel-an-rad-manover, in which the Ferrari pilot pushed the inside, with the risk of holding out after two moves to defend the third curve.
Max dives began at one of the back of the field and was on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round seven.
He was then for a large part of the fastest race since he was on his tires to finish quickly and pick up Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
He finally went into the box at round 44 and did not make it possible to take a step in the remaining eight rounds, while raikkonen ended up as a fourth.
It was a difficult day because Valteri had been doing a great job all weekend and acting like a real gentleman when he was supposed to pass me over.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double victory," says Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of this Saturday's election event about Senator Diane Feinstein, who insisted that Christine Blasey Ford's letter, in which he was presenting sexual abuse to the candidate for the Supreme Court's Brett Kavanaugh, not to be handed over to the press.
At the event in West Virginia, President Fords spoke not directly before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that the proceedings in the Senate show that people are "common, wicked and dishonest".
"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the last few days is when you see anger when you see people who are angry and angry and mean and uninhabitable," says the President.
“When you look at the Leaks and then say, ‘Oh, I wasn’t.
I wasn't."
Do You Recall?
Diane Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think of your answer... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, one moment, please.
If we... no, we didn't publish it," he added by following the senator's voice.
Feinstein received the letter with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and was published in early September. However, Feinstein argues that the leak comes from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't publish your story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret and I answered her request for secrecy."
Your dementia did not seem to be well received by the president, who said on Saturday evening at the election: “I tell you one thing, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continued defense of the judge's candidate, who was subjected to three women's sexual abuses, claimed that the Democrats would use the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain the power by all means.
You see the community, the wickedness, they don't care who they hurt when they let them get under the wheels to gain power and control," said the President of the media.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer reached two gates for the giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made the defeat on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants through a 5:3 victory in the back in Dundee on Saturday.
The giants went early with two doors in the lead, after meetings by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie paid for the home team before Dwyer restored the leadership of the giants.
Francois Bouchard appeared for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen won the victory with two doors.
This was unexpected for the men of Adam Keefe who beat Dundee on Friday 2-1 in Belfast, the third defeat in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the three previous parties.
Dwyer's opening tower took place in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a presentation by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later David Rutherford delivered the presentation, when Beauvillier expanded the lead.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan returned the home team to the game after 13:10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt Cownie helped out at 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the leadership of the giants before the half-time break when he reached his second door of the evening shortly before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Buuchard regrouped again with a Power-Play Hit in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen to bring Dundee into the party for the first time later in the second half. Nielsen then secured his team the victory with a fifth door after almost half of the second half.
The giants who have lost four of their last five games now play at Milton Keynes Stadium the next Friday.
Flyers died after he made sure that hundreds of people in an airplane escaped the earthquake
A plane in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found death in order to secure a plane with hundreds of people on board.
Over 800 people die and many are lost after the island of Sulawesi was terrified by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong neighbourhoods are still to be felt in the region and many people are trapped under drums in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save your life, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his posts at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in order to ensure that the flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, was safe.
He jumped out of the tower when he thought he was crashing.
Major died later in the hospital.
Johannes Sirat, spokesperson for the Indonesian Air Safety Service, explained that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, says Australian ABC News.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We are deeply affected by this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could rise to several thousand. The disaster protection authority of the country stated that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number is expected to rise as many bodies are still under the sinks, while others cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new car comes with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are being waged everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get even worse."
On Sunday, Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu and declared in an address to the country’s military: “I ask you to work all day and night in order to carry out all the tasks of evacuation.
Since you're ready?" says CNN.
Indonesia was already shocked by earthquakes in Lombok this year, where over 550 people died.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports now from a missing aircraft crash in Lagune
The airline that conducted the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now reports a missing person after first claiming that all 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in a statement that they could not say anything until Saturday afternoon about the stay of a passenger.
The airline agreed to work with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane had crashed into the water when trying to land on the Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials reported that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline claimed that on Saturday there were six passengers in the hospital but were in a stable condition.
The cause and the exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both explained that the plane landed in the lagoon shortly before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane flew off the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane hit very flat.
"That's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to water by means of deep water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking aircraft.
He said that the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that mattresses working close to the improvement of an ambulance were using an inflatable boat to help bring people to the coast before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
The data from the Aviation Safety Network can be seen that 111 people have died in the destruction of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the course of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution closed its evidence in the renegotiation of a case in which a man was ordered to ban a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the American Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he, on phone calls, reconstructed the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on her deathbed.
Rowlett said to have received position data from various phones that showed that Tellis was together with Chambers on the evening of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers during which he indicated to be at his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and said he wasn't in town on the day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis had told the truth when he indicated that he had been in Sanford's Pick-Up this night, Sandford said he had lied, "because my Pick-Up was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis indicated that Chambers had known at their death two weeks.
But phone records show that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis got rid of their messages, calls and contact information from his phone a few times after Chambers died.
"He took them out of his life," says Hale.
The defense will probably begin on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the procedure is then before the jury on that day.

Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance by artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the United Kingdom.
Another black?!
New York Children's Girls complained about a dismissal after "racist" SMS
A New York girl complains about a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrong message from her mother, in which she complained that she was "another black".
The couple struggles to be racist and compare the legal dispute with an 'expression'.
The double mother Lynsey Plasco-Faxman expressed her frustration when she found out that the new mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she entered her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN, ANOTHER SCHWARZE," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending this message to her husband, however, she sent the message to Maurice.
After she recognized her fauxpass, she dismissed the "feelly touched" Plasco-Faxman Maurice and claimed that the locked African-American mother had done bad work and instead had waited for a Filipino, says the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her work day and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice complains about compensation for dismissal and makes a claim for compensation for the 350 dollars per day, which she would last for six months, the job for which she was originally booked, but without a contract, and for which she would have lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look at what you don't do," she said on Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejected the racist proposals and argued that the release of the reasonable step was because they feared Maurice, after they had offended her, could no longer trust her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," explained husband Joel Plasco of the post.
“But would you trust your children in a person who was rude to them, even if it was out of proportion?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the legal dispute with an "expression" and explained that his wife was only expecting a baby in two months and was "in a difficult situation".
“Do you want to interest such a person?
This is not very nice," added the investment banker.
While the dispute continues, the couple was quickly convicted in public and rushed to the social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify themselves with a talking bear, revealed a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the adoption of the book, said about the letter: “It is hard to move into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it is very funny with our today's knowledge of Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before he was inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, had no problem with it, would have been rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication after his death was "sweet" last year.
She explained that her father was secretly proud of the success of Paddington, which she described as "very important family member".
"He was a very quiet man and didn't wash," says Jankel.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child that does something special: you are proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he's seen Paddington's success like that.
Although he invented and created it, he always gave Paddington himself responsible for his success."
My daughter died and I had to decide on her phone
After the country, her daughter was brought to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried vainly to save her life.
“Nad regularly called to say that it looks really bad and that the doctors gave her little chance,” says Ednan Laperous.
“Then I received the call from Nad, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to decide on her.
And that's what I did.
I said to her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications you have given your doctors to keep their heart on the pump are slowly ringing and leaving their body.
She had just died, and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn't wait until I knew what was going on.
I could not cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to get together."
Finally, Ednan Laperouse, who was now grieving for the loss of her daughter, went along with the other passengers who didn't get anything from what she was going through, on board the plane.
"No one knew," she said.
I've had my head down and tears all the time over the waves.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sad women hang cards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost their loved ones to suicide try to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphrey hung on a bridge in Wales map with inspiring messages and telephone numbers for consulting.
Davis son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he started suicide.
"I don't want parents to feel like I feel every day," she explained.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a cook and he had a burning smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smiles could brighten up a room."
However, he announced his job before his death because he was “in a very dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after suicide by his 11-year-old brother.
Davis explained: “I am always afraid that this could have an effect.”
Davis has designed the maps “to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it is a friend.
Don't be silent: you have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he was depressed or depressed,” she explained.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was at the bottom of it on the Christmas Day, and when the children were unpacking their presents, he did not see them in their eyes or anything."
She said that her death was a great trauma to her, but that she had to go through it: “It’s a huge hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the Swebe while the FBI starts with investigations
"I thought if we actually got something like that that he asked, so a time-limited and limited investigation, we might get a little intervention," Flake said on Saturday. He feared that the committee in the party's position "outbreak".
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Your rebellion can only be traced back to Timing.
The elections on 6 November are only five weeks away. If the Republicans cut down badly as expected, then they would be significantly weak in their attempts to choose their husband in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush took the phone to call the senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh. He had worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
There is a vote in the Senate in which 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to decide on an equal footing and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean overflowers “low” under Kim
The number of North Korean crossings to South Korea has been down since Kim Jong- and seven years ago, as a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, which relies on data from the South Korean Reunion Ministry, explained that overruns were registered last year 1127 compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called more stringent border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher human smuggling prices than the main factors.
Pjöngang did not make a public statement about this.
The majority of the crossings from the north are finally offered the South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most fly across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the passersby more than illegal immigrants than refugees and often brings them back with violence.
The relationship between the north and the south, which is technically still in the war state, has improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two Heads of State met in Pjöngang to discuss the agreed denuclearisation negotiations.
As a result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, where they generally agreed to work on a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without being able to trust the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Mir Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says that he is not fit for office at the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the representative's house Nancy Pelosi called judges Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t take the impression that a woman who had acted as such would have been referred to as “hysterical”, Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate’s Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally depressed all charges that he had abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when both teenagers were.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he cried almost and stood out in tears just before he spoke of his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the charges against him a "large and coordinated "murder murder" organised by liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton's lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proves that he could not serve at the Supreme Court because she showed that he was pre-opted against the Democrats.
"I believe that he has made these statements and the way in which he drew attention to the Clintons and the Democrats, even for inadvertently," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh from the office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so much: if he does not tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judicial posts," says Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Federal Appeals Court in Washington D.C.
Pelosi further said that she, as a democrat, was concerned about the possible decisions of Kavanaughs against the Affordable Care Act or the Degradation Framework Decision Roe v. Wade, as he was regarded as a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh asked whether he would review certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“We don’t need a hysterical, pre-adopted person who goes to this court and expects us to say, ‘I’m not wonderful’, says Pelosi.
Women must use it as a weapon.
It is a sincere hate speech, months and years of boiling anger and it does not get out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Stein told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, and you?"
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she also wept when she got angry, but developed a technique. When she got angry and started to cry, she said to the person to whom she said: “They may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just keeps talking.
I thought it was great."
Tears are permitted as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is to a former job, in an office dominated by men, where one day I cried out because of an indescribable anger, and by an older woman, an under-cold manager, before whom I was always a little afraid, was packed into the pot and dragged into a stairwell.
"Let her never see you cry," she told me.
“They don’t know that you’re stinking.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy with you because they think you've gone to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Hart was acquired on board a ship named Monkey Business in an external affair and then withdrew his candidacy, the most frustrated siblings thought that there was no reason to consider the idea of the presidential candidacy itself.
"That wasn't a well-thought decision," she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation ‘Snow Whites and the Seven Horses’.
Since the election had already progressed, she was at the back of the middle class and she was reluctant not to run if she was not supposed to get $2 million.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found out that some of her supporters, who spent $1,000 on men, supported their campaign with only $250.
"Do you think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
In the speech in which she announced not to launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration over the system which made the procurement and direct address of the voters so difficult instead of the delegates, and anger over the sexism, that she stood close to the tears.
"You could have assumed that I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls to the press reactions.
“I could have believed that the shopkeeper Kleinex was my sponsor.
I still remember asking myself what they would write on my tombstone.
"You're crying?"
Why Beijing could benefit from the US-China trade war
The openings of the trade war between the US and China were arduous. Although the battle has not yet been over, Beijing could benefit from a long-term grave between the countries, my experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, fired the first warning panel at the beginning of the year when he presented important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminium, with criminal duties.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new fines on goods worth $200 billion, which effectively affects half of all goods imported from China into the United States.
Beijing each time came back in the same way and recently raised fines from five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to respond to any US action and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon be halted.
To move Washington to join would mean to pretend, but it would be too much fun for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, my experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China can benefit in the long term from the effects of the trade war by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries is, in fact, much more dangerous than many observers have known before,” says Abigail Grace, a scientific employee who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security Memorial.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in rebuilding the country that has been devastated by the war for over seven years.
In an address before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure as a result of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government rebuilds the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions have now been laid down for the voluntary return of refugees to the country which they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and living grounds.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that there would be no conditional acceptance of aid from countries that had supported the rebellion.
Europe won a victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the Ryder Cup 2018 and won Team USA with an end of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won back the crown after the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
The American Star Phil Mickelson, who had problems with most of the tournaments, lowered his defeat on the 16th train (Par 3) in the water and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all its rounds and became one of 4 players who achieved a 5-0-0 since the tournament in its current format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was hit at 5:4 by the players with the lowest ranking in the team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the best ranking worldwide, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so incredibly happy to win back the pod.
It is about the team and I am happy to have made a contribution," said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He goes on to meet his countryman John Rahm, who won the American Gulf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1 at the individual meetings.
I'm so incredibly proud to have beat Tiger Woods that I've been watching on television since my childhood," says the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A remarkable statistics for one of the largest players of all times who has won 14 important titles and is only overcome by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had to find the fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had put down high-quality performances throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I am proud of the boys, they have fought.
There was a time tomorrow when we put Europe under pressure.
We didn't do anything about it.
Hut off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players gave up a good performance.
We will regroup, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated."
