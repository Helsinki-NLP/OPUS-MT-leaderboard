The social map of Ivanov Region is recognized by the electronic means of payment.
The changes provide for the maintenance of a public passenger transport benefit.
As of 24 September, the arrangements for a favourable tour of citizens using the social map of the Ivanov region are changing.
As reported by the press service, the Government of Russia on the Ivanov area, changes provide for the maintenance of the public passenger transport benefit and bring the social map interconnection scheme into line with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 of the FZ “On the National Payment System”.
The social map of Ivanov Region is recognized by the electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application change.
Thus, the filling limit is now set not as early as before, but as cash, with winter and summer periods of not more than 400 rubles in the summer period of not more than 800 rubles per month.
The social card holders will now have to track the balance of the remaining travels, not the balance of the money, on the receipts issued in the transport.
The cost of a comfortable trip for citizens will be 1/2 tariffs applicable to the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of the trip is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The timetable for filling the social map with money remains the old one, from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new social map travel arrangements will have a number of advantages.
Yes, it is possible to take a detailed account of the spending of money on a social card with the accuracy of the copies.
In addition, there is the possibility of a return of recorded but unencumbered funds.
Let us also add that the layout of the accounts with the carriers is becoming transparent, as now half the cost of the trip is paid by the citizen and exactly the same amount is reimbursed to the carrier.
No commission will be taken up on a cash map.
In turn, Vasili Silkin, deputy head of the Department of Road Agriculture and Transport of Ivanov, reported that more than 33 million social card trips had been made in 2014 in the region, and nearly 25 million trips had been made in 2015.
In the area budget, more than 470 million rubles are provided for the benefit of citizens using the social map.
As of 1 September, more than 312 million rubles were reimbursed for these purposes.
At the time of the 911 teacher's phone call, he confessed to the murder of a friend
During the phone call in 911, the teacher, Ms. Shannon Lamb, told the police that he had shot his friend and that there was a need for staff to come home.
Lamb stressed that there's a "foot" in the house that's alive, but probably upset, and said that contact with the deceased's family can be found on her phone.
In the house, the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a note, handwrittenly on a white sheet of lily paper: "I am very sorry, I would like to return everything back, I loved Amy, and she was the only woman who ever loved me," says the note, according to the representatives of Lamb's body.
There was nothing to suggest that Lamb, who conducted two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, was able to travel 300 miles to a university campus where, according to the police, he shot all the respected professor of history of Ethan Schmidt at the threshold of his office.
The chief of police at the State University of Delta Lynne Baford reported that the university staff had learned about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that real 911 call soon after that.
By the end of the day of the victims, there will be one more: Lamb has been killed as soon as the police have surrounded him.
The next day, after the shooting at the educational institution had forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, officials were still trying to put in one picture the motive behind Lamba.
Information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as by students and staff who knew him, helped to form a portrait of a talented but perhaps concerned teacher.
The students explained that they were looking forward to his training.
The police in Gottie, where Prentiss died, reported that he was not charged with violence or criminal charges.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in his written book, in which he expressed his appreciation for the “wonderful people” with which he crossed into his teaching life.
Both of them taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 teachers, and many students attended lectures from both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
One student who spoke well of Lambe, Brandon Bevers, said that he seemed nervous and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb had told him at the end of the year 2014-15 about how he struggled with stress.
Previously, Lamb asked the State University of Delta to grant him sick leave, said he had some health problems.
This year he was teaching only on two online courses.
Recent changes in university rules of admission meant that the doctor ' s degree, over which Lamb worked so hard, would not guarantee him the automatic receipt of the teacher ' s position.
The president of William Laforz University told him that he knew nothing about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course Mr. Lamb had something in mind."
These are questions Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
The police attacked after Lamba's escape from the campus when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a gun of 38 caliber in the backyard of the house, one mile south of his parents ’ home in Greenville, Mississippi, reported the coroner of Washington Bethel Johnson County.
His engine car was still on its way.
Right away, it was hard to see why Lamb came to this house, although, according to Johnson, she believed that he knew the people living in it.
Lamb grew up in those areas.
Lamb began working at a university of 3,500 students in the city with a population of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received a degree from a doctor of pedagogical sciences in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamb’s former friends described him as a wise, charismatic, and cheerful man.
Carla Hearston told me that she was 15 years old and that Lambu was 20 years old when they got to know each other through common friends.
She and her friends studied in senior classes, and he was a class elder who for several years tried to teach her to play guitar.
In those years he enjoyed the success of women.
All the girls were lying when he was around," says Hearston, who is now 40 and who lives in Jackson, Brandon's suburb.
Lamb and Prentiss have probably met for a while.
While on the phone at 911 Lamb said, "I killed my wife," there was no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Goth in a kirpique house, whose side goes out the canal.
According to the police, the dog is fine.
The ex-husband Princess, Sean O'Stin, reported that they were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and that they have a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"She's too much," O'Stin told me about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he didn't meet Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met Princess when he and Abigail were both at a summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at the concerts.
O'Stin told me his daughter wrote music and poetry.
Prentis was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Schaffer, a bartender and co-ordinator of entertainment programmes in the dark, illuminated bar The Julep Room in Gote, said that the last time he saw Lamba and Prentiss on the evening of 5 September, when Lamb finished playing the guitar and loss charm for a few visitors.
There was no suspect.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were just having fun and looking at each other.
In the sense that they were both very sharp.
Schmidt, the dead teacher, conducted seminars for the first class and specialized in the history of indigenous Americans and colonial America, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same educational institution.
He was married and he had three little children.
He studied at the University of Kansas State in Emporia and was president of the student brotherhood and student self-government.
At the campus of the State University of Delta in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and members of the community, participated in a memorial ceremony for the burning of candles.
The women of Schmidt Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a ceremony at which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The occupation will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," Laforz said.
Crisis's over.
It's a healing day.
Amy and Rohelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped to prepare authors of Associated Press Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with a statement by the police that the Call of Lamba had been received in service 911 after the murder of Schmidt, as well as because, although Lamb and spoke of Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, the information they had been married had not been confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer staff for the holiday season
Toys R Us reported that he would not hire as many staff for the holiday season as he did last year, while the children ' s toy rétailer assured that staff and temporary staff would be able to work longer hours.
The company reports that it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and on optimizing bases across the country, less than 45,000 people employed for the holiday season 2014.
Most of the jobs would be part-time.
The company reported that interviews with applicants would begin this month and would increase staff numbers from October to December.
Although the shopping season is getting closer before the holidays, companies are preparing to hire temporary staff in order to have sufficient space in the shops and for the sale, unloading and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is kidding about "welcome" with Princess Diana.
The movie "Back to the Future" was a great event for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the arrival of members of the royal family, and I noticed that the place next to me was free, and here I was placed - next to me is Princess Diana," he told in a trailer about the screenplay of the documentary "Back in Time."
It's a movie, and here I come to the mind that I'm literally out of hand and in a fake rabbit from meeting with Princess Wellsky.
"Back in Time" - a documentary on "Back in the Future" - includes an interview with Fox, Lee Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemex and executive producer Steven Spillberg.
The movie "Back to the Future" premiere was held 30 years ago.
"For me," says Spielberg, "this is undoubtedly the biggest movie about travel in the time that has ever been taken away."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in some movie theaters in October.
UN chapter states that there is no military solution in Syria
In response to Russia's military support for Syria, Secretary-General Pan Ki-moon stated that the “no military solution” for the nearly five-year conflict would exist, and arms growth would only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN chapter once again called upon all participants, including the UN Security Council, to join and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Mr. Gui Moon said at the Wednesday press conference that he was planning a meeting with the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent members of the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France during the Ministerial Session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that disagreements in the Council, as well as among the Syrians and the local authorities, had “made the situation unresolved”.
Mr. Gui Mun called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they had demonstrated in addressing the nuclear programme on Iran and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 survey results that show that Donald Trump is not kidding.
Some have tried to hang a provocative tag on it.
Others turned away from him, perceived as a joke.
And some need scandals.
But no matter how some Republicans try to undermine Donald Trump's high status as a result of the polls, they have failed.
Ten of the last 11 national surveys have demonstrated the advantage of Donald Trump in two digits, and some are starting to seriously wonder what this means for the real estate magnet to get a nomination.
Of course, it's just the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to appoint the Republican Party.
The experts point out that in 2011 Rick Perry resigned from his winning popularity with German Cain, none of which had won one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have fought in the general election.
But external groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super-Committee on Political Activity, and the Economic Conservatives' Club of Growth recognize the insatiable force of Trump and begin to deliver their dollars to challenge him.
Here are some of the survey figures that say that the real estate magnet is not just an intermediate phase:
The trampa's sympathy ratings were 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his application in mid-June, Monmouth University survey showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive impact on the real estate magnet.
By mid-July, that was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 per cent.
Six out of 10 Republicans are now positive for Donald Trampu.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators are getting tops in the early stages.
The Quinnipiac survey in Iowa last week found that 60 per cent of the Republicans were in favour of Trampu.
Two thirds of the voters for the GOP would have appointed Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 per cent of the Republicans said that they had either been "with a brilliance" or "satisfaction" if Trump had become a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "damaged" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent say they would be "big" against 40 per cent of those who say the same about Trump).
Next at the level of shock?
Marko Rubio, with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republicans say that they will be "unsatisfied" or "satisfied" if the Jeb Bush event is a candidate.
Most of the Republicans do not consider Tramp to be a problem.
While the mass trampa is criticised for its arrogance and insults, 52 per cent of voters from all over the country think that the magnet has the right temperature to be president, as the ABC News/Washington post polled Monday showed.
The same figure appears in the first closed assembly in Iowa, where the same 52 per cent of the Republicans believe that he has the same person as the chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 per cent believe that he is not the person who can be effective at the post, and almost six out of 10 independent voters say that his temperature is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
The Republican voters are accustomed to this.
When they put on their traps of knowledge, voters-republicists think that Trump is serious.
On the question which was the most likely winner in the name of GOP, four out of 10 said that Trump was a favorite, according to a CNN/ORC survey last week.
It's not like four out of 10 were put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: The GOP voters did not have the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the past cycle, four out of 10 Republicans elected Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent supported potential candidate Mitt Romney.
However, this shows that many GOP voters consider the Trump campaign to be convincing.
Even if the Republicans were to join another candidate, Trump was still ahead of everyone else.
Some findings indicate that such a distribution is likely to benefit Trump, while non-Trampa supporters are equally distributed among more than ten other candidates.
But a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in a hypothetical match “one by one” between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is almost always supported by the majority.
He runs Carly Fiorino at 13 points, Marko Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kessic and Chris Christy at 33 points.
He has nothing to do with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate that's going around him?
Ben Carson had a total of 19 points in the hypothetical competition "one by one".
More than half of Donald Trump's supporters say they've changed their mind.
The new CBS/NYT poll, held on Tuesday, showed that only more than half of the votes in favour of the Trump said they were confident in their votes.
Obviously, many can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
46 per cent say they leave the door open to other candidates.
However, the most intense competition in Trump for the moment is with a colleague-outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've changed their mind will probably choose Trump.
Six of the 10 republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violent" two months ago in his opening speech, immigration became the most current topic in the 2016 talks.
Some are concerned that Trampa's poetry would turn key voters of Latin American origin from the Republican party and interfere with rebranding.
But according to the ABC/Post poll held on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans said they agreed with Trump on immigration.
Therefore, until immigration attracts the attention of the general public, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Disappointment by the Government is taking on new developments.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now count on support for approximately half of the Republican voters, mainly because of their foreign status.
Six out of 10 Republicans said on Monday a new ABC/Post survey that they wanted a political outsider rather than a man with government experience.
And they're also injured in Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey conducted two weeks ago in Iowa shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed by the activities of the Republicans in Congress, with 54 per cent being “unsatisfied”, and 21 per cent being “in anger”.
The Government will decide on the fate of the pension indexes in October.
RF Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodec said that the Government is now looking for options for implementing the Pension Indexing Act in 2016 at a real level of inflation, the GG said.
She noted that the decision had to be found by 8 October, until the draft budget was submitted to the Government for the following year.
In addition, the Cabin is discussing the possibility of extending the decision to freeze the Russian funeral pension.
The hungry noted that the amount of pension stockpiles was 350 billion rubles.
The full pension index for the following year is approximately as high.
According to the vice-premier, no final decision has yet been taken on the question of who should pay contributions for the unemployed.
The hungry believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong to the socially unprotected categories of citizens, it is not entirely fair for him to be paid by society.
The media had previously reported that there were two options for balancing the budget in the cabin.
Why are they often angry and red for centuries?
Responds to Dr. Tatyana Levasov:
Our centuries are shears that protect the eyeball from the many tiny particles that are sitting on them.
Forgetting the regular cleansing of the centuries, we often contribute to the development of bluff.
Output simple:
Don't keep your eyes on the dirty hands, wear a special wet soda for ever.
Not less than 1-2 times a day clean the end of the century from what is stored in them for the day of harmful substances.
Clean-up procedures are not much complemented by warm compressions with healing grass openings (salpheus, romaches) that ignite the dense secret of salty iron and then by the massation of centuries, which should be carried out by circular movements of fingertips;
Do not use alcoholic beverages while cleaning.
They dry and dry the skin, and help to increase the secretion of salty iron.
Phenyan claims that the Korean nuclear power plants have created an atomic warhead.
The North Korean authorities reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country, the nuclear complex in Yonbene, is "full of power".
This was reported on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency of the country.
It is noted that at any time, the CNDR is ready to respond to “aggression and nuclear threat” and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “both by quantity and by quality”.
The latest test of nuclear weapons was carried out by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
Plans for the resumption of the reactor ' s full-value work have not been reported since.
Phenyan claims that he was able to create an atomic warhead.
The CDR has also repeatedly tested medium- and small-range missiles, writes Polit.ru.
Girinovski demanded to remove the mention of the brothers from the Russian gym.
LDPR leader Vladimir Girinovski believes that the reference to the union of the Brotherhood should be removed from the national gym.
He said so during the Gosmund meeting, “Russian News Service” reported.
Who are these peoples now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long gym, the longest in the world, even athletes can't stand," said Jirinovski.
The MP believes that all four quarters of the line should be removed:
In 2014, Jirinovski stated that the current gym needs to be changed to "God, King of Food", and the Russian tricolor to replace the imperial flag, writes Polit.ru.
Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
President Bashar Assad of Syria called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe wants to deal with the problem of refugees, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not that Europe accepts or accepts refugees, but that the root causes of this problem need to be addressed.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
That's our opinion on this problem.
"In this context, the issue of refugees," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue our dialogue in the name of consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are not possible until people die as long as they continue to bleed and people do not feel completely safe.
"So we can reach consensus, but we cannot achieve anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria," Assad stressed.
For example, some 500 thousand migrants, including those from Syria, arrived in the countries of the European Union this year.
The European Commission stated that the current migration crisis in the world was the largest since World War II.
It is not excluded that among migrants arriving in Europe there may be thousands of extremist fighters from the Islamic State.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia may use the situation to create their cells in the EU to carry out terrorist activities.
The inhabitants of the German city set up a holiday for refugees.
In the last month, Germany had become a leader in the reception of refugees, although it had recently stepped up border control to prevent their influx.
According to the authorities, some 800 thousand migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts call them very large numbers.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
According to the BBC, Jenny Hill was living in Darmstadt, the city of which is very warm to migrants.
Jeremy Corbin begins at the session of the Prime Minister
After the election, Mr. Corbin's debut at the session of the Prime Minister's affairs was expected with great anticipation
The new leader of the Laborist party, Jeremy Corbin, will soon be the first to address the Prime Minister's issues, for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will address the first of the six issues raised in the second half of the day; his statement will most likely be closely followed by the press and Members of Parliament from the Layoubourist Party.
He called for “less theatre and more facts” on a weekly demonstration talk.
He also stated that he could miss some meetings by leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test by Mr. Corbin as manager; it will take place after his appointment of a tennis court and his speech at the annual Congress of Trade Unions on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the decision of the leader of the Laborists to stand silent during the national gym in service on Tuesday, during the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, was criticised by a number of conservative members of Parliament and became the subject of several excellent articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin ' s decision not to sing State Gymnasium drew attention
Mr. Corbin's Press Secretary stated that he was “standing in honour” and acknowledged “the Heroism of the Royal WFP in Battle of Britain”.
However, a member of Mr. Corbin Owen Smith's tenure office reported Newsnight to BBC 2 that he would advise the leader of the laborists to sing the national gym "independent" of his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Almost half of the Ten Ministers refused to play with Mr. Corbin's team, sounding disagreements on economic, defence and international policies, while at least one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
The BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant said that political differences were also “crooked” in the Laborist party after Mr. Corbin’s appointment to the position in the European Union and the Government’s limitation of compensation payments.
Mr. Corbin said at the Trade Union Conference that the Lao Party had amended to remove the very idea of limitations in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the Deputy Minister of Labour and Pensions, said that there was “full clarity” in the party because it was opposed only to Government plans to reduce the ceiling from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the Laborists David Cameron will meet with at the "Course Box" for the past ten years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Laborists, who promised a different approach to politics, said that he had " attracted collective resources" in order to raise Mr. Cameron's ideas and received more than 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from the Islandton North District said that the Prime Minister's issues were being overcommitted, and that he would also refrain from the harsh responses and exchange of quantities, instead of promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and problems facing young people.
Mr. Corbin said that Angela Igle, the Minister of Economic Affairs in the tenure office, would replace him with the Prime Minister when he was absent - for example, when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also sounded the idea of allowing other colleagues to speak when possible, said that he was addressing the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Berkou, to discuss the matter.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to get away from the political style of the “armaroo balagun”, often associated with the Prime Minister's procedure, but recognized that he had failed a few years later.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the questions of the Prime Minister have become a key indicator of the leadership ' s views, their ability to manage the House of Commons and their reputation with other Members of Parliament, although critics claim that this has become a caricature and requires extensive reforms.
"Scattered in Yeoburg" Homeless young people who have studied photographers
Johannesburg Business Centre is a difficult place for homeless people.
But a group of former unwarranted men found a way to earn a man’s wages and earn a living.
"I was taken to Yobourg" is a non-commercial study that teaches homeless young people to take pictures of the circles and work on it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.

Sterling Pounds grow as wages grow in Britain
The pound has grown to the background of wage growth in Britain, and the FTSE 100 index has been raised as a result of the proposal to purchase SABMiller.
From May to June, British earnings increased by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate has been the highest since 2009 and has been met as a transfer for the earliest forecast for possible growth of quotations.
The pound of sterling increased by more than 1 per cent over the dollar and amounted to $1,5505 and 0.84 per cent over the euro by €1,3730.
FTSE 100 grew to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
In general, SABMiller's shares increased by 20 per cent thanks to the purchase proposal from the competitor AB InBev.
The deal would unite two world's largest beer companies, gathering brands such as Budweisr, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
The shares of Burberry grew by 0.9 per cent in the light of encouraging news from the competing Lux Richemont product group.
The latest sales data in Richemont exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China -- the key market for Burberry -- began to grow again.
The Glencore shares grew by 5 per cent after the mining giant stated that it was able to receive $2.5 billion through stock placement, which was done under the debt reduction strategy.
Mondi's paper and packaging stock group was the leader of the fall in the index, at 4.3 per cent, after Goldman Sachs reduced the rating of the group to “sale”.
JD Sports shares grew after a sports clothing supplier company reported 83 per cent of the taxable increase of up to £46.6 million.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages can interfere with expansion
The Executive Director of JD Sports Peter Kaugill says that the increase in the minimum wage for British workers means “high purchasing capacity for potential consumers”.
But it is unlikely that such purchasing capacity will outweigh the increase in labour costs, he says.
The cost could have an impact on JD Sports expansion plans, he added, which could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash launches a low-implementation campaign to combat Aldi pressure
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi’s pressure in South Australia and Western Australia.
The leading supplier of food on the low initiative launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA riders in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the forthcoming influence of Aldi $700 million.
While Aldi is preparing to open two optical warehouses and the first of 120 shops in South and West Australia in the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and promote IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social media and Adelaide Show activities.
Ritailers and IGA suppliers, such as the manufacturer of frozen Simmo's from Dansboro, who offers tasting in IGA stores, and the owners of shops selling their tickets to the football match in South Australia with discounted customers.
Metcash is expected to disclose more details of its protection strategy on 29 September, the day when this opt-in supplier of food, alcoholic beverages and economic goods will carry out its annual investor strategy day.
A lot has been put on track since in South Australia and Western Australia, IGA stores account for almost 30% of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and West Australia are known to be engaged in ordinary routes, so the market here is more favourable for IGA rytheaters than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in the US and 24 per cent in WA compared to about 14 per cent in the eastern states.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will account for 5 per cent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of its first stores, taking up sales in all existing players, but mainly independent rétailers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, analyst Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA Rituals can lose $360 million a year in sales and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year with sales of $500 million and $600 million in these markets respectively.
The loss of profits and sales of food at the high level of permanent costs of Metcash could cost companies around 13 million dollars before paying interest and taxes, Mr. Kirat said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and this is because Morgan Survey's recent study found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
In Morgan Stanley, Metcash's food sales are expected to fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, fund manager Hemish Douglas, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, observed at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash “may probably disappear over a decade.
Metcash refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas' comments.
However, a member of the board of directors of Metcash was expected to contact Mr. Douglas last week.
The market share of IGA decreased from 18 per cent in 2010 to 14 per cent, while Metcash's revenues from the food business, which the company provided to IGA about 1200  Ryteliers, fell by 43 per cent compared to 2012 as a result of the operating develvet and due to pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not give up spending more than $150 million a year on the basis of price differentials in Coles and Woolworths for a thousand positions per week and helping IGA reintroducing trading venues, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider selection of firm food products.
Director-General Metcash Ien Morris said that the price balance and the refurbishment of trading areas was increasing, and he hoped that the company would increase its net profit in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakis supports President Tennis Australia Steve Hill
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves respect, not criticism of his conduct.
Tanasi Kokkinakis has suffered indirectly in the recent scandal around his friend Nik Kiryos and deserves more than criticism for his conduct, as President Dennis Australia Steve Hill says.
Kokkinakis, the youngest in a talented duet and often called "Special Ks", was reluctantly at the centre because of the post-stimulating heat of Kiros with Stan Vavirinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Soon thereafter, during a hot qualifying match in Cincinnati, the judge had to understand Kokkinakis twice and his opponent Ryan Harrison, and Harrison said, "Wavrinka had to put on Kiryos' shoulders, and I had to put on this guy's shoulders."
C while Kokkinakis last seen a cracking missile after the shipmate in his leg saved Risha Guske from a possible defeat at the US Open, Hilli loyally protects Kokkinakis.
The youth is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grott for the right to be the second after Bernard Tommy in a single-class semifinal of Cube Davis against Britain.
"I'm very worried about one thing, that's what Tanasi got into the conflict," said Hilly.
He really broke a rocket when he had his foot on the U.S. Open, but he wasn't the first game that broke the rocket when hopes went down, and I know Tanasi well enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he was very good at provocative situations in the United States, with Harrison, etc., and I'm sure he deserves trust.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a great family, and I just think he's been a little dishonest.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he's a lot of work, he's a good team member, he's never had a problem with other players, he's respected outside the court, he's a hard-trained man, he's a very talented and developed young man, and I think he should be evaluated for dignity.
Hill also supported the decision to forgive Kiryos for an important match starting on Friday, assuming the “joint agreement” was the right outcome for all, but assuming that a guy from Canberra would return to the team as a long-term player.
"First of all, we want the team to focus fully on the match, not on the arguments around [Kiros]," Hilli said.
And I think Nick has gained power very quickly, that people like Federer and Marrey prove, he's growing up in the eye of the audience, he's made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it's necessary to get him out of the center for a while so he can think about them, and that's best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares an emergency, closes the border, delays migrants
As a result of the announcement of an emergency, Hungary crossed the border with Serbia on Tuesday at the southern border and detained those who were trying to penetrate the country illegally to hold back the flow of migrants.
There were riots at the border, hundreds of migrants buried in the border area, which were severely negatively reacted by the Serbian authorities.
Having stopped for an indefinite period on the road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing armed violence at home broke the tents and were based on that location.
However, discontent grew.
When they were surrounded by police helicopters, migrants shouted "Open the border!" and yelled at the Hungarian police for a special assignment.
Some of the protests refused food and water.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Serbia announced an "unacceptable" expulsion of migrants back from Hungary, when they are increasingly coming from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be a part of the problem, not a related damage.
Negotiations with Brussels and other countries are needed in the near future," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The elections at the Hungarian-Serbian border began the next day after a group of 28 countries had been unable to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to shoulder common responsibility for 40,000 people seeking asylum in Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that a further 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary, will be reached in the future (in the following month or by the end of the year).
The Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel and Austria, on Tuesday, called for an emergency summit of the Euro-Union next week to discuss the immigration crisis covering the continent.
Hungary, however, does not expect immediate action by Brussels or its neighbours.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation in the two southern regions gave the authorities more power to take action against the crisis, allowing them to cross the road and speed up the asylum case.
Meanwhile, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Siejarto, said that his country was also planning to recover the collection from the coal mine at the border with Romania to cover the flow of migrants across the country, now that it had completed the collection at the Serbian border.
Correspondent CBS News Charlie Dagata reported that even the prisoners were engaged in urgent work to complete the lineage between Hungary and Serbia.
In the past few months, Hungary has become the main “low place” and the crossing point of the Euro-Union border for displaced persons, many of whom are victims of war in Syria and countries of the Middle East.
However, the Prime Minister of the country, Victor Orban, insists that most of the people who come to the country are economic migrants seeking a more prosperous life, not refugees who are victims of war, who have the right to protection, and this view is clearly in conflict with the views of other EU countries, namely Germany.
The new laws that entered into force in Hungary at midnight now see as a crime a 4-metre (13-foot) crime or a violation of the 4-metre (13-foot) strike from a branch of the Government building along the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison terms for those accused of trafficking.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government has declared an emergency," said a representative of the Government of Zoltan Kovac in the southern town of Seged.
We make it clear that the illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
The formal parliament still has to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but the Reporters Associated Press, who are on the border, have been watching the presence of armed men with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Dürd Bacondi, the National Security Adviser of Orban, reported the appointment of 45 persons who sought to cross the border at the border and 15 others within the country.
They crossed the border, broke the fence, were currently under police custody and were charged with administrative violations under new laws.
The authorities quickly restore the fence.
On Tuesday morning, the Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven crossings on the border with Serbia, pushing for the blocking of one of the crossings of the railway wagon covered with a roll-over.
The riots erupted on the main crossing of the border near the city of Rioske, Hungary, as the Hungarians placed a service space to let people in a metal container, and crowds of people pushed each other to break in.
About 20 people were able to enter, and thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main road from Serbia to Hungary and announced that they had refused food and water until they were released to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders has been reduced by two in a national survey
Former Secretary-General Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-pronged advantage in the democratic race for nomination throughout the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is chasing her.
Clinton now has 47 per cent support among the primary democratic voters (down from 58 per cent) and Sanders is the second with 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Byden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential race, is supported by 15 per cent of the primary democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the competition in the primary elections, the majority of democratic voters said they were talking too early about what they had decided with the candidate they would support.
The Clinton partners are more confident in their choice than other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost some support for demographic groups, and Sanders has won some bonuses.
Clinton has a great advantage among women and the dead, but this advantage has been reduced.
Her support among men fell significantly, and Sanders stayed away from her for only five points.
The preference given to Clinton by the voters-democrats for 50 years has disappeared, and they and Sanders are now on the same.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage among senior voters.
Last month, Clinton beat Sanders for a two-digit number of Liberals, but Sanders now has the advantage of 5 points in this group.
Almost half of the country's primary voters say they would be enthusiastic about supporting Clinton if she was a candidate for the party.
The fourth would support it with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would support it only because it was a candidate.
Six per cent would not support it.
Perhaps it is not surprising that the current supporters of Clinton will most likely show more enthusiasm on her behalf.
Of those who do not currently support Clinton, the views are more contradictory - only about a quarter with enthusiasm would support her.
While 48 per cent of primary voters say that they would be enthusiastic about supporting Clinton, fewer voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trampe (35 per cent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question why they want to see her candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the necessary experience (16 per cent), then that the time of the President's women (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for this position (10 per cent).
The Clinton supporters are also talking about an association that connects it with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It is also called an agreement on issues and opportunities for election.
Since the Vice-President is considering potential electoral participation, 57 per cent of the primary democratic voters would like him to join the race, although the third believes he should not.
When asked who they would like to see in the second place among the candidates from the party, the primary voters-democrats are in most cases called Baiden.
Of the supporters of Clinton, more than half said that they would choose Baiden in the second, more than Sanders.
If Byden decides not to issue his candidacy from the Democratic Party, the advantage of Hillary Clinton over Sanders will be increased from 20 points with Byden among the players in the race to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five per cent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, this figure fell by 78 per cent last month.
Byyden has been lagging behind in the second place, but the percentage of those who consider him to be the most likely candidate has increased.
However, responding to the question that is most important in the candidate, democratic voters choose options other than the chances of being elected.
Similarly, last month, none of the candidates from the Democrats or potential candidates were unacceptable candidates for these primary voters.
Candidates from Democrats, or potential candidates, have shown good results in some of the key features among the primary voters of their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Baiden to be honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Byyden of all three leads in honesty, and the strong side of Clinton in her leadership.
Thirty per cent of primary democratic voters do not consider Clinton honest and trustworthy, twice as much as those who say the same about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have a certain opinion on this issue.
The primary democratic voters also generally consider the same ideological views as Clinton, Sanders and Baiden.
In all these measures, about four democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
While questions concerning the personal e-mail box and the server at Hillary Clinton continue to be addressed by her Secretary-General, most primary democrats are satisfied with her explanation and believe that this has not had a negative impact on their general view of her.
But it's a completely different story for the American public in general.
Half of Americans today are not satisfied with its explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
The public was still divided in March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say that the controversy about e-mail has had no effect on their general opinion of Clinton, although 36 per cent say that their opinion has deteriorated.
They are mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10, who claim that their opinion about Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton considered the voters to be honest and credible from her party, this continued to be a problem for her among the registered voters in general: only 32 per cent considered her honest and credible at eight points below last month and 15 compared to May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters throughout the country do not consider the Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump both, however, are getting good grades on leadership.
Of the six protested candidates by Byden, Carson and Bush, the best result is honesty.
Most people in Sanders see a more honest person than they do, but like Carson, many have no opinion about him.
The threshold for sampling of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
As a result of the national survey, Ben Carson has approached Donald Trampu in full
Ben Carson has made an all-inclusive visit to Donald Tramp in the last CBS/New York Times
The two candidates received half the votes in the new poll, leaving all the others behind in the search for support.
Protesters from all over the country continue to support Trump, whose support rate increased from 23 per cent in the recent CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month to 27 per cent in the Tuesday poll.
But Carson flew for the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also showed that Carson was supported by all demographic groups by pushing the Trump into a group of Republican voters with higher education.
The remaining candidates, with the exception of Carli Fiorina and Governor Ogayo Jon Kassić, went back with Governor Wisconsin Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10 per cent last month to 2 per cent now.
Former governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas, Mike Haqabi, and Senator of Florida Marko Rubio, hold third place with 6 per cent.
The threshold for sampling of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey is plus-minus 6 per cent, which took place in September.
The recent CNN/ORC survey published last week showed Carson's growth in surveys, showing 19 per cent of the Republicans' support, with 32 per cent of the support for trampo.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed that the tramp was significantly overrun by Carson.
Because of the increase in Carson's support last week, Tramp made several critical incidents with the former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning the faith of Tramp.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during the closing of the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the Brotherhood are accused of the death of the first student at Baruch College
About two years later, after the death of a college student during the ritual of ordination in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, the charge of murder was filed against five people.
"The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood at Baruch's New York College were severely attacked by Chan Michael Deng during the ceremony in September 2013 and did not deliver him to the hospital on time, which led to his death," they reported to the police.
Officials say that a student with eyes tied and a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back several times as long as he tried to reach his goal as he walked across the surface.
Mr. Deng finally complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood didn't call 911 when Dang lost consciousness, and they were waiting for an hour before he was taken to the hospital, they were talking to the police.
However, they have found time to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in Google and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the brotherhood, to ask for advice, as told by police chief Chris Wagner at the press conference.
"At this point, the members of the brotherhood began to hide personal property, in essence, by becoming the welfare of the brotherhood above Michael Deng's health," said Chief Wagner.
They couldn't save him, and he ended up the next morning.
According to the disclosure report, Deng had suffered several sudden head, toll and thigh injuries.
“Too many families have suffered as a result of rituals devoted to the brotherhood, as at least one student dies each year, starting in 1970”, said Douglas Fireberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
Brothers and their members must bear responsibility, and this step by the authorities is very important.
Monroe's oath counties have turned for the benefit of the third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Ms. Menga, will be charged with violence against a new and criminal speech.
"We want to involve not only individual participants in responsibility, but, if there is an organization that has authorized all of this officially or informally," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch’s college banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood expelled the local branch from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There will be an increase in interest rates, and the bull market will collapse, the bond's income will rise, and the economy will drop into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it's going to be before the show, and how long it's going to continue.
In particular, for the economy, there is little to explain about time.
The recession occurred only 11 months after the first increase in rates and for a total of 86 months.
The strength of the Federal Reserve to raise rates often, although not always, determines the response of the economy and financial assets.
The U.S. Central Bank therefore insists that investors should not focus on when it begins to raise rates but on how much adaptation will take.
In fact, there are many variables in the game.
At the end of the day, however, market participants may find that the overall increase in rates is excessive.
"The first increase in the Federal Reserve with a global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the end of the money age," said Julian Jessop, the chief international economic specialist in Capital Economics, in his commentary on clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of interest rates in the United States to be more normal but still low will be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
This is how some areas of the economy could respond, depending on historical trends:
As already seen in the market in the last month or about, the expectation of rising rates may lead to some instability.
When the rate is increased, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
"It is unlikely that stock revenues will slow down for 12-24 months after the first jump, which again probably reflects a delay in monetary policy" - analysts Deutsche Bank said in a recent study of the Federal Reserve's increase in rates.
If in particular, the market for the last approximately 35 years has changed more sharply - about 14 per cent - on the increase in rates, it remains sufficiently stable for 250 days thereafter (average growth of 2.6 per cent), then, after 500 days, returns to normal with an average income of 14.4 per cent for the last six cycles, according to the recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief trade strategy specialist in Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche says that the result for securities tends not to become more immediately expressed at the stage of interest increases, and stock revenues are beginning to decline.
The recessions are a fact of economic life, but rising rates often contribute to it.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed in conditions that did not exist earlier and could accelerate recession.
In general, the gross domestic product will be at almost its lowest point for the duration of the high rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases, only twice the nominal annual GDP has been below 4.5 per cent since 1950.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 per cent, few believe it was long, while in the third quarter it held only 1.5 per cent, according to Atlanta Fed.
The increase in rates on such a unstable economic background could be risky and asked whether it would be different this time, reported in Deutsche.
Market participants are prepared to increase the Federal Reserve System's rates throughout the year, and their views are drawn to the meeting of the Federal Committee of the Open Market, which ends on Thursday.
While many policy and economic experts believe that FOMC could approve an increase in rates at this meeting, future trade is only a 25 per cent probability.
“In our study since 1950, all the rates increase cycles to this day have been in the supercycle of the growing financial gap with GDP, covering the peaks before the recession, very soon after the start of recovery,” says the report.
In contrast, this was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle for the moment is the longest that the Federal Reserve System has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record has been 35 months, it has only lasted 74 months and it has not yet been completed.
Fixed income has also become unstable while the market is expected to increase rates, and this scenario is in some ways similar to what is being achieved for shares.
The fundamental difference is that the effect on bonds will be faster than on shares when the Federal system changes its strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it appears that income changes the vector immediately after the first increase/reduction of interest rates in the cycle.
At the end of the increase in rates, bonds' income fell immediately," Deutsche reports.
Experts on the Charles Schwab strategy believe that rising rates will bring long-term and short-term bonds' income levels closer together, making the curve smoother.
High-income bonds often behave better in such a climate, although "we are still afraid of fluctuations in income," says a study by Katie Jones, a regular income analyst in Schwab.
It is interesting that Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of the Federal System ' s policies.
“In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and the fall in inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has developed a more rigid monetary policy perspective,” she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans rose, income growth was more flat, credit advances increased, volatility increased - all market characteristics were strengthened by the Federal System ' s policy.
In general, companies that run their major business in the United States win from increasing interest rates and local production will become more attractive.
International debt companies will become worse because the growing dollar makes their products more expensive in the world market and their debt is cheaper in finance.
"History shows that "quality" actions demonstrate the efficiency of the market over three months after the initial increase in rates," said Goldman Sachs in a customer report.
Companies with a stable financial situation have passed through companies with a unstable status as a result of each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004, on an average of 5 percentage points.
High-income companies and low-voltility shares also showed better efficiency than low-quality shares, on average, at 4 (percentage) and 3 (percentage) respectively.
The debt will become a big question.
Companies with a high interest rate of debt with a floating rate lose most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely stock exchange transactions, consumers will benefit from the growing dollar.
Investigators could also see their income through higher income, although experts were spending on how fast this would happen.
BBC Radio 3 - Copy Classic FM - Member of Parliament of Conservatives Andrew Bingham
Member of Parliament of Conservatives Andrew Bingham criticised the station for "reducing standards"
Proves that it is becoming less and less competitive than a commercial competitor
He also aimed at BBC Music Awards, saying that the bonus was just sour with Brits.
A colleague of the Damien Collins Parliament, who has violated The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 is becoming a Classic FM," said the leader of the parliament, urging the radio company to prove that it is doing something that commercial companies are not doing.
A member of Parliament from Conservatives Andrew Bingham also told the BBC leadership that the public radio station seems to be “stupid” and is becoming increasingly different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems to--I don't like to use the word "simplementation," he said, but it seems to turn into a Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards prize launched last December.
BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something else, here's two examples that first came to my mind, where you're actually just copying what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General of BBC denied the charge, claiming that BBC Radio 3 was moving far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and audience education.
What I'm going to find out about Radio 3, I'm not going to find out about classical music anywhere else.
And his devotion to live speech and the creation of music will not really compare with anyone else.
"So it's really very important, I think the interest of Radio 3 in the search for new music and the promotion of new products," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 Manager Alan Davy claimed that radio stations had to work much more to attract audiences than in the past, because the British were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child of BBC who was attacked by five commercial competitors during the hearings of the Ad Hoc Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
A member of the Parliament from Tori Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical show of talents that BBC bought at the Dutch Talpa Media at an indicative price of 22 million pounds of sterling.
See why this programme is often discussed in connection with the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, which is attended as judges by Paloma Fate and Boy George, was done in a typical BBC style.
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find a hit in his own home horse" next time she started a fun project.
However, it does not consider it necessary to impede the commission of new The Voice seasons in the future or the use of money by those paying the license fee to other entertainment formats.
Internet sales growth has slowed as much as possible in August and may be due to the Black Friday
The first three months of 2015 saw an increase in online sales by seven per cent
Last month, the slowest growth has been observed since it began to be observed in 2000.
Online sales increased three years ago using mobile shopping devices
Experts are convinced that November Black Friday could help reduce costs
For about ten years, virtual shopping has been booming, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost cities.
But experts say that there have now been signs of online sales balancing, after the latest data showed only a half-percent increase over the first three months of 2015.
Total online shopping costs in August have shown minimal growth since they began to be fixed in 2000, with only a five per cent increase.
Experts say that there have now been signs of online sales balancing, after the latest data showed only a half-percent increase during the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rate in previous years and come back to 2000, they've always found a reasonable explanation," said Guardian Andy Malkehi, editor of the IMRG Sales Index.
He explained that online sales had increased three years ago when buyers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people had the opportunity to buy online and that they could do so under any circumstances, such as sitting on a sofa.
But now it comes out on the plate, and you can see the decrease (growth).
The phenomenon of Black Friday, which came from America, is referred to as one of the causes of the delay in sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying before the event that took place last Friday November.
Last year, buyers, five times as much as the average, rushed to computers to make use of beneficial offers, thus interrupting a number of vendors ' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers enter this fight for profitable purchases, could cause people to refrain from shopping
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, more than 1 pound of sterling per 5 is spent online.
With regard to products such as televisions and stereos, more than one third of them are sold via the Internet store.
At the same time, more than four people buy clothes and shoes online more readily than in fashion shops on central streets.
Muslims are burying those killed when the crane falls in Mecca and sanctions are imposed on Ben Laden's family
Muslims carry 29 dead bodies on the streets, as the first funerals begin in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed the building giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after the skull was broken
Hundreds of Muslims flocked all over the street to bury 29 of the victims who had been killed as a result of the collapse of the skull on the main mosque of Mecca.
The clothes mostly in white, which are present at the funerals, filled the passage to give tribute to the first of the dead who went their last way to Al-Moaiss.
The seal process went past a sacred place where the building crane had fallen to the edge of the sword just a few days earlier and had fallen upon its subjects.
The bodies were issued for burial, while the King of Saudis fined a construction company belonging to the Ben Laden family for an accident that also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 persons killed in the destruction of the skull in the main mosque carried on the streets
Among the dead were the father of the four children of Kasim Akram from Bolton, the Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage to the palace when the crane broke up.
Mr. Akram was in the main mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual haja.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj in Mecca will continue, as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
King Salman today stated that Binladin Group should not have left the crane shot on the unworked crane.
The Arab version of the decree issued by the Saudi Press State Agency states that Binladin Group is partly guilty of an offence.
The English edition of the news agency did not mention this detail, but reported that the company ' s leaders had been banned from going beyond the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to identify the cause of the skull falling into the main mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims arrived to go to the haj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements regarding the interruption of the crane and its representatives were not available for comments.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and inappropriate harmonization of action with the weather service.
Tens of cranes surround the main mosque of Mecca, as part of the extensive construction work carried out by Binladin Group.
The Ben Laden family is one of the closest to the ruling family in Saudi Arabia for decades and manages the largest construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaida Usama Ben Laden was the son of a changer, from whom the family declined in the 1990s.
The accident occurred with strong winds and rain only a few days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the palace, which is obligatory at least once in life for every hardworking Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 people remained in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million rials (about £174,000) to relatives of the deceased, and the same amount was irrevocably raised.
The remaining victims will receive half that amount.
Chapter B&Q argues that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European masters working for small money
According to Veronica Lori, the British are more and more employed by repair professionals

They say the British put aside milk and paint boxes and instead hire skilled Eastern Europeans to do housework
If you can talk to the milk or gently decorate the walls, you seem to be in a minority in our day.
Because, according to the company owner B&Q, the British are increasingly recruiting specialists to carry out the hard work at home.
Veronica Lori, the new Director-General of Kingfisher, who owns the home-building services network, reported that this trend was accompanied by a significant flow of skilled experts from Eastern Europe offering minimum-price services.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores specializing in goods for masters and to close 60 B&Q warehouses at the same time.
Ms. Lori said that she would like to see more women in B&Q store staff since eight of the ten purchase decisions in the store were made by representatives of the weak sex.
Most of the staff are men at present.
She said that there was no indication of the recent demographic trends characterized by an increase in the number of single women ' s households that were more concerned with housing than in the past.
Mrs. Lori said, "There are still men working mostly in our stores.
Steps should be taken to achieve a balance.
In general, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on goods purchased are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Lori, one of five women in the role of leading British companies, whose shares are included in the FTSE100 index, also changed the team of top managers from among directors of the same number of men and women.
Kingfisher is not the only company with 50 per cent of female managers, including the Director-General and Finance.
Ms. Lori said, "It was a conscious solution, diversification, an important issue for us.
It was easy to find suitable women in the board of directors.
After the group had incurred the costs of closing shops, Kingfisher showed a fall in income and sales for half a year.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new stores
Time of decision on the interest rate of the United States Federal Reserve
The world is watching a meeting held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which will discuss the most important decision within two days, whether to raise or not a percentage for the first time in the last decade.
The 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought that the Federal Reserve would do so last week now believe that it would still delay and maintain a current rate of 0-0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching the fact that the main bank may move from a zero point of view and begin the process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
The U.S. economy is working effectively, economic recovery adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision affects the world economy.
He warned markets that changes should be prepared, but all said that they were confident that all odds against such a move would be met.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
A new Balkan route: refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
"Open!" -- hundreds of refugees are blackmailed at the Horgosh checkpoint at the Hungarian-Serbian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has crossed the border for the displaced.
The asylum seekers are already beginning to miss out on other road options in the EU.
One of them is in the vicinity of the closed border with Serbia across Romania.
Another is through Croatia and Slovenia in Austria.
According to some data, buses that have taken refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the city of Shida on the Croatian border.
The leaders were ordered by the authorities to follow without interruption.
The Serbian Minister for the Interior Nebojsa Stepanovic assures us that his country is doing its utmost to help refugees, but its capabilities are limited:
Our work is to secure Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to have a humane attitude toward them.
But it's already a common European problem.
It is not easy to resolve, no country in Europe alone will be able to do so, and a smaller country like Serbia will not be able to do so.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban is not worshipful:
If someone is called a refugee, he must fill in the documents required for that in Serbia.
And if he doesn't, he won't be allowed in our country because he's safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already established a 175-kilometer border fence with Serbia.
But the Orban is not going to stop: it plans to build the same dam on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Mayrakis: "Europe wants to help us."
Vangelis Maymarakis has been a party to the Right-Central Governments, which, in the left view, led the country to a financial crisis for several years.
Now he, as the interim leader of the New Democracy Party, is challenging Cyprus.
A few days before the election, he met with journalist Evronius.
Evronus: Mr. Mayrakis, welcome to Evronus!
Angelis Mayrakis: Thank you for your invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat by joining the SIRIZA coalition, but now, according to the polls, "New Democracy" was compared to her by popularity.
What's changed during this time?
Angelis Mayrakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Cyprus lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget profit and prospects for economic growth.
The country now has a budget deficit and a high level of unemployment.
The investors left because Mr. Cyprus chased them.
In the past nine months, the Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises of Mr. Cyprus.
And now they can easily compare the promise with what actually happened.
Daily life was much worse than January when the situation improved, with most Greek citizens concerned.
Euronews: But you are saying that if you win the election, you will strive for alliances with other parties, including SIRIZ.
Vangelis Maymarakis: The point is that, as we have seen in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is not a coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in place, political forces and all ruling parties have gathered together to implement the programme they have agreed to, without giving up their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that, at the present stage, only cooperation between political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Cipras and the creditors of the country.
If you become a new prime minister on Monday, will you implement this agreement, or are you trying to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Maymarakis: In fact, we voted in favour of Greece's European road movement, because we are well aware of the devastating consequences that would result in the country's departure from the EU.
Europe is now helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, the Juncker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All of this would have been lost had there not been a treaty with Europe.
But the current harsh economic measures resulted in Mr. Cipras negotiating.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek Government wants to order during the first year, operates rationally and realizes that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am sure that all commitments that cannot be fulfilled because they lead to recession can be negotiated again, but only after a certain time.
It would be a mistake to believe that we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors in the first year of the new agreement, as they await full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to restore their confidence, we must continue to privatize, reform and structural changes that have been agreed upon, and continue to benefit from EU funding and greater investment opportunities that we need to open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Government of Cyprus did not present any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we have identified by discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example of farmers' income.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the Cyprus ministers never talked about it.
In other words, the Greek ministers were not prepared and badly informed and were unsuccessful in negotiating and concluding an unsuccessful agreement.
If you win the election, you'll soon be at a table with Mr. Junker, the Netherlands, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them be different from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, told them?
Vangelis Maimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014, we have tried best to implement the 2012 agreement, with the sharp corners around it.
We have made progress on reform.
Of course, we did not have the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in an emergency.
The market had fallen, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price established by the Greek Government.
At the time, I was the speaker of Parliament, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups, which were then the governmental majority.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working parliament, which was in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations going on outside.
And we were able to bring the country into a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the early universal elections resulting from the December presidential elections.
Euronews: The mass flow of refugees has been moving throughout Greece over the last few weeks.
What do you think about the situation and the reaction of European countries that these people are seeking?
Vangelis Mayrakis: The refugee crisis is a slowdown bomb that we have to deal with after the election.
And the reason is that the Syrian Government did not act in this situation as it did.
Such issues should be addressed as only emergency measures remain if you are faced with a problem.
And we're in this situation right now.
Even the temporary Government, which had changed the SIRIZ, had done more in seven days than Mr. Cyprus had done in seven months.
I am sure that these actions by the interim Government, which is providing valuable assistance to the President of the Republic, who is calling for the EU summit, will enable us to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and note that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some extraordinary events that happened to them.
This issue has a profound humanitarian dimension, and we will stick to the positions that European policies must adopt in this new situation.
The relevant decision should be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border control and refugee reception centres.
We also need to make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to cope with this pressing problem.
Mr. Mayrakis, thank you for the interview.
Angelis Mayrakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful town of Druzkovka Donecke, during the day of the criminal investigation of the Chief Police, the area was jointly identified and detained by a suspect, 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the town of Krivoy Rog (Dnepropertrovski), who launched a car into his opponent during the night of the joint use of alcoholic beverages, and the conflict in the village of Verhnettoretz of Yasinowat district.
A 22-year-old boy was reported from a hospital where he was hospitalized with cross-fire wounds.
As told by Artem Vasicki, the Deputy Chief of Police Chief of Criminal Investigation, the law enforcement officers have demonstrated the involvement of the figure in another serious criminal offence - the murder of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
The operatives found that on the same day between the suspect and another local resident, there was a conflict that led to a man having a fatal gunshot wound in his head.
The Investigation Division of Druzkovsky GO opens criminal proceedings under the articles “Intentional Murder” and “Intentional Injury” of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The detainee is threatened with imprisonment for up to 15 years.
The officer was detained and placed in a temporary detention facility, reported to the police in the Donetsk area.

Two more residents of the city were sentenced to limit their freedom.
The inmates of Novosibirsk were sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years in prison.
Two other convicted persons were restricted to 14 and 18 months.
The Lenin court of Novosibirska recognized the four citizens guilty of vandalism against Lenin's monuments, which were located on the territory of the CRC and on the Tricotage Street, as well as the monument of Slavia.
In the last case, the Katyusha missile plant and the T-34 tank were decorated.
Remember, on the night of 12 December, in Russia's Novosibirsk, the unknown ornaments in the colour of the Ukrainian flag were military technique at the Slavic Monument.
Citizen wife of the popular Russian actor Evgeni Kyganov Irina Leonov gave birth to the seventh child.
The girl showed up in a Moscow clinic.
The newborn and her mom are feeling good.

The man who opened the shooting at the State University of Delta left an apology note
After the shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning -- and before he shot and killed his colleague later that same day -- Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying that he was "suffering" about the first murder and would like to "turn everything back," the authorities reported on Tuesday.
Police in the city of Gote, Mississippi, report that the professor of geography and public science at the University of Delta called 911 about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he told me he shot someone.
Lamb told the D.A. that the police had to send people home.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there was a "foot" in the house, which "no one grieves," but probably upset.
The police were interested in the name of the caller, but he didn't call him.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the shot.
When I came to the crime scene, the police found Amy Prentiss' body there, 41 years old, and a note from Lamba, 45 years old, saying, "I'm sorry I'd like to return everything.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb passed 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, and on Monday evening, when he was surrounded by the police, he ended up with him.
The head of William Laforge University reported that he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb apparently had something in mind."
Despite the information Monday that Lamb suggested a romance between Prentiss and Schmidt, the official services reported on Tuesday that there was “no information or evidence” of the “love triangle”.
The Prentiss was referred to as "good man" by Sean O'Stin, who reported having been married to her for about seven years.
They were divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Stin told me that he and Prentiss had a daughter of 19 and that she was "unsuitable."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsey Nouls, which is called the newspaper San Gerald, a close friend of Princes, the last one working from home on the Internet.
Nouls told me that Prentiss had a hunting dog called Lightning and that she had met Lamb for about three years.
Nouls said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called his family on Monday at some point to say, "He won't go to prison."
The same night that the police hit him on the "1" show near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself there.
According to a summary published on the university site, Lamb received a degree in pedagogy at the State University of Delta.
Stars Losing Their Success
The actor (left), in a photograph with his son Redmond (right), survived several difficult years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his multi-year life satellite, Farru Fossett, who died of cancer.
The actor was reported to have also suffered from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug trafficking.
All of this certainly played its part.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United went out for a few months because of a double break
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the Champions League match, in which Manchester United lost PSV in Andrew.
While the defender is experiencing this, which will not be able to go out on the field for at least six months, Louis van Gal hopes that the show will be able to play again during this season.
Tramma took place during Hector Moreno's unreasonable hint at the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw was in the PSV penal zone.
He was assisted in the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gall said, "He's got a double break, and he's in the hospital."
They'll take him to Manchester tomorrow or the day after, and then they'll operate.
It's terrible. The young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, and he's got through a lot of trouble and started playing fantastically, and this is where it happened.
There was an oxygen mask in the compartment.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double break, it's for six months, and the guy won't be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and no penalties were assigned.
Arbitrary Nikola Riccoly didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gall believes that the Italian judge made a mistake.
You judge yourself when I say it's worth the penalties and the red card.
It was a very bad underpants with two legs.
In his tweet, Shaw writes, "Thank you all for your messages, not to describe how I'm devastated, my way to recovery begins, I'll be back even stronger than I was."
More on the subject: Manchester United is in trouble with Luke Shaw in defeating the game with the PSV
The English defender will be further encouraged to join the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Koku, Coach PSV, said, "This is a very serious trauma."
When any game comes out with such a trauma, it's all very upset.
It was never the intention of our players to traumatize the opponent.
Moreno broke his leg when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team led by Van Gala at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's very hard now because he didn't intend to hurt the enemy, and when you hear it's a very serious trauma, you feel bad," said Kok.
I couldn't see for myself.
The only thing I could see was the ball that flew in the other direction, so it looked like he (Morino) touched it, but I didn't see the hint under Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6 Moreno, he said, "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to carry it.
I'm really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really.
Andres Gardado from PSV was also delivered to the hospital after meeting Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Loracs?
Every parent adopts one thing very quickly: if your child has liked a book, it will take some time before you wake up to know her almost naked.
See, unless you're David Cameron.
Responding to the question of the representative of a children's vacation company in Canicula, about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose Lorex, an environmental-deception story written by Dr. Suez in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a comment published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "This funny, touching, unusual story with a strong message I like to read to my children, because it always finds some image or message we miss."
And yet, apart from the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to reread the contents of the book, he is actually talking about a single film taken in 2012, with new characters and details added to diversify rather short originals.
"In the surrounding high walls of the city of Universeville, where there was nothing green and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to conquer the heart of Audrey - the girls of his dream, fulfilling her wish - to see this tree," - we read in the text a description of the love story that Dr. Suez (now named Theodore Suez Geizell), who died in 1991.
If this is not suspicious enough, Cameron's text is read almost as a short presentation of the Lorex film set, posted on the Internet Movie Database: "In the surrounding high walls of the city of Universe, where everything was artificial and even air sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - the girls of his dreams."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, generally recognized as an active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of a book that a boy's name is not familiar with how the environment destroys the greedy tree reaper and the sticker "sweet" by findingkins, despite the protests of Loraks (the name of the book) - a funny substance with the lips that "speaks on behalf of trees".
Most likely, such an uncomplicated PR task was commissioned by an executive who had never read a book about Loracs 20 times in a row.
The representative of Downing Street stated that the text was allegedly received from the Cameron office in the electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comments were received.
For Adam Lita there was a clear risk that he would not fall into England, but it is still a difficult question.
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is an easy task, but if you look at the collection that England has chosen for this tour, the repetition of the 3-0 series of tests that happened last time seems unlikely to me.
I would also not exclude the victory in my field.
The team of Alistair Cooke may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but it includes players who are virulently taking ball and collective thought strongly; they do not bring with them scars from 2012 but only a youth positive.
Moen Ali's ball is turned into a ball bearing ball, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an offensive option.
More on the subject: Adam Litt left England on the test cricket and was replaced by Alex Heilz
The decision to exclude Adam Lita, his chief coach in Yorkshire, is, of course, difficult to analyze.
His seven test match had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the obvious but harsh reality was that the players in the cricket were judged by judges as a result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement because (and I've already said this before) toys are best chosen by themselves.
A couple were half-hearted, and Lithuania could have waited for a longer career, but he was in charge of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more wounds to Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
The principal coach of England's assembly, Trevor Bayliss, spoke well of his mood, even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and that doesn't surprise me; he's primarily a team game, and then everything else.
The question of how long it will take before the Batman of the Test Cricket is left to the impression that it is a difficult question.
Lit played seven games like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton was nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play in his own field and abroad.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean League when Litt was in the best shape, but this lost opportunity already in the past.
Alex Hayles appears, and he's the Batman I appreciate.
He's an unpredictable cricketer that we saw at the Yorkshire Club at the beginning of this season when he won 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but it would, of course, depend on the membership of the OAU team.
The idea of putting Moen next to Cook as an opening bet, which would allow the introduction of an additional backbone, keeping four speed boules, is to be considered, and I am not against it at all.
I don't see why the playing can't hit the ball there, and this lion has already shown himself to be a damn good critic.
Moan may not be exactly what he needs for his Woostershire County, but he became their third number, and there's no big difference here.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test match "third Batman" before leaving as an opener in 2001.
He won three hundred and didn't look.
Zafar Ansari comes into the congregation as a reserve sponsor, and with my continuing company with him, he has proved to be a very promising young man to me.
People can look at its typical statistics - on average 31 with bits and 35 with balls - and think it's a risky rate, but among the supporters who voted for a little, and chose youth.
He'll learn a lot in this tour.
In addition to the collection, England plans to make a few practical additions to the training staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayouardin, a Sri Lankan Batman, as a test runner's consultant, could be a master's move.
He's one of the best guys for the game that will bring her the richest experience of all possible conditions and any attacks.
Paul Collingwood is included in the games where a white ball is used, and it will provide both energy and inefficient speed in the set.
I have always felt that he was born to be active in international cricket, whether playing or training, and like Mahela, he has little intelligence.
Sometimes new votes in the divide, even if they say what had been said before, can give new powers to the team.
Colleague of the Darema Ben Stokes team has been left for one day, Ruth has been given a similar break with Australia, and I do not, for example, experience any problems in this regard.
Although not all agree, the coaches and players do not define the timetable.
And you should remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easy.
The British side camp from the Euro Union can win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron's ingenious policy to resume negotiations on Britain's EU conservation is increasingly difficult every day, even without considering the choice of the genius Jeremy -- "Is it true or not?" -- Corbina as a leader of the laborists or the TUC's malnutrition about Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbins and Nigel Faraji.
The European Social Diplomat explained in the days when the EU is now in a situation that is experiencing a variety of crises - not all of them in its own production - that some of the countries participating in the British self-centered agenda are in a position to deal with the changes that they do not want.
Upon meeting in Briton on an annual meeting, TUC decided that he would not want them in any case if they destroyed social protection.
We could even call it "the selfie program of Dave and George."
The Prime Minister and Minister of Finance are tortured by summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photographed by a well-known local monument, in or without a local celebrity company, then come home and say they are attracting allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who is interested in maintaining external contacts with the British under the European Union - "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin - suggests that the ministers and officials in some capitals come to understand when they're going to be, we're going to stay or go.
Angela Merkel, a very cautious Chancellor of Germany, is an ally, but she is in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before the situation worsens, as it has worsened for those sitting in her seat Tetcher (11 years), Mitterran (14) and Kolya (16).
France's head, France, is facing a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing his power, too.
Poland may soon receive the nationalist Government of the right hand, Spain - the left.
It's hard to see them coming out of the van to help the self-britches whose energy could be wasted on preventing Scotland from leaving the UK, which they don't want either, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can even plan to publish deliberately useless SNP-style remarks during the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to boost the UK's process of leaving the EU, my friend suggests.
"The revision was a fixed idea" and "British has no value from the renewed negotiations."
Europeans in their poverty know what kind of thief Flit Street might be, and how skeptical of the EU are media magnets, unlike Tony Benn's 1975 referendum, which supported our accession in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
They can hardly remember Boris Johnson, a native Euro-opportunist, who celebrated his 'EU direct bananas' by the Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his nonsense, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a company of fearsome jugglers, phone hackers and non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair was actually quite the same about them, but he realized that when you're in a giant gorilla cell, you have to give her bananas to pull her away and not let her eat you on a chain and again with tea.
In fact, Milliband was more committed to Blair than Blair himself, in opposition to Cameron's idea of the referendum, because Blair acted in favour of the repealed EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who issued him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him any of this.
But my friend Jeremy Corbin, who had me on his back in Westminster on Monday -- I told him that he had no time to spend it on me -- seems to be at risk of repeating the strategy of Neil Kinnock's "boycott Merdoku" from the '80s -- a mistake and then, and now.
This may take time, but he must develop a consistent strategy of interaction with the press - not with me, but exactly with Andrew Marm, on whom he sat on the floor at the U.S.A. on Sunday.
The official position of Corbin on Europe is that I gently call evolution.
He said he would like us to stay in the reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditionalist Ukip trend and a wider circle of “small England” in the midst of the thoracic can probably say yes.
It's the same as Hillary-Bennan, but not Bennit-Bennan said on the radio and TV this week, while his internal combat shooter from all over the force refused to admit that the appointment of Corbin as a "ten-year-old" finance minister was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the 1970s when his father-in-law, out of all his strengths, was on TV for disloyalty to his colleagues at the Laborist office, not going too far and not losing his position in the Cabinet of Ministers.
Hillary's battle was more attractive.
But the fight to remain "under any circumstances" is not what McDonnell said, and not what J.K. said to the Parliament and the Parliament at a private meeting on Monday evening, in general opinion.
In order to inform the democracy and his "boy" Corbin - remember, he has crowned me - the discipline of the messages remains important for the seven-day cycle of television seven days a week, and especially in the watercourse of social networks, the outbreak of paranoia and betrayal.
It is reasonable not to allow Cameron to separate so easily from Europe, allowing him to accept as a worthy supporter of the Laborists during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But the main mistake McDonnell and Corbin's EU membership -- as part of the "bennit economy" of a fortified fortress -- is no longer the issue of esoteric debate among left dissidents for whom narcissism, born of minor differences, is the central principle in dogmatic disputes.
With regard to his misconceptions about NATO, Tom Watson was sure that J.K. would not hesitate to leave, foreign diplomats would be obliged to try to bring this to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital -- they also have suspicious voters -- on Britain's concessions when all this could be pointless?
The United States is already very disappointed by the weakness of British military action in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Government of the United States will cut the costs, as I was reminded on Monday at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticise the review of electronic cigarettes from Public Health England
The Agency ' s Government-funded statement that electronic cigarettes were 95 per cent less harmful than smoking had been reported by researchers to meet 12 people, some of whom were tobacco-related.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet criticized the evidence used by the Public Health England (PHE) agency in its electronic cigarette report.
The PHE published an important report, “reversive” last month, calling it “the universal review of evidence”.
However, some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed out that some experts were involved in the tobacco industry.
In the editorial article in Lancet's medical journal last month, they criticized the “extremely barbaric argument” on which PHE built its main conclusion.
In article BMJ, two other researchers were asked whether these statements contained “solid or sinister grounds”.
Martin McKi, Professor of European Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at Liverpool University, reported: “The fundamental principle of health is that the rules should be based on evidence of effectiveness”.
According to them, the public expects the PHE statements that “the current best estimate shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less harmful than tobacco” were based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and modelling.
This is, in fact, the only meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a multi-criteria model of decision-making to sum up their views on the damage associated with various non-tineocontained products; the results of the meeting are briefly presented in scientific publications.
McCi and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose director general was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
It also confirmed BAT health certificates in the sustainable development report.
One of the 12 persons at the meeting announced funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, noting the funding he reportedly received earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
There was no reasonable explanation for the choice of board members, but there were several well-known sponsors of electronic cigarettes, some of which also reported funding for the industry in the publication.
It is not known whether other participants have experience in tobacco management.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco manager at PHE.
The scientific article, published by the group, “is clearly agreed” that there is a lack of “serious evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria”, wrote McCi and Capewell.
However, none of these links and constraints were affected in the PHE report.
McKi and Capewell said that PHE ' s statements that “there is currently no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a road that leads children or non-smokers to smoke” were premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Head of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that BMJ ' s statements had already been answered.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than tobacco."
One of the two people who smoked all their lives died from his passion.
All the evidence implies that the health risks from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the far-reaching consequences.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what they are proving and what they are not proving, especially where the public had doubts about the relative danger to tobacco.
About 80,000 people a year die from smoking-related diseases, and it costs NHS 2 billion pounds a year.
Clearly, even though electronic cigarettes are not safe, they are only part of the harm caused by smoking, we are carrying out our tasks before the nation.
Former Channel 4 considers that BBC should stop the EastEnders series
Former Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that BBC should stop issuing programs such as East Enders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would have much to offer for such a successful show as the sweet opera on the Albert Square.
Johnson noted that licensing fees should only be used to create programs that are not issued by other British radio companies.
He criticized BBC for putting public news broadcasts, which are probably only looking at a small part of the audience, for the peak airtime when competitors go to a high-rated show, and for channels like BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had unsuccessfully tried to cooperate with BBC during his six years at Channel 4.
"I cannot separate myself from the idea that BBC is preparing to launch and broadcast transfers that might show competing companies that do not receive subsidies," said Johnson to members of the Committee on Communications of the Chamber of Lords as part of a follow-up to BBC.
If you keep the licensing assembly that I do not consider to be a good medium- and long-term solution, companies should leave only those programs that are not issued and are not to be issued by other companies.
The Voice show comes out of the air in the premium slot because the creators want to get as much support as possible for the future.
The idea of no one showing him again is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go to finance transfers that could be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is the other; they are generally known for their own production.
Other channels would no doubt have given up much for her.
I don't understand how this could be a public good news.
I don't think that would make the BBC feel any lower.
Serial Entrepreneur Johnson, channel leader of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC of pursuing ratings “because of the ambitions of staff and because of their faith that this is the best way to gain long-term support”.
His comments on the most popular show on BBC are based on comments by Executive Director Sky Tony Ball, who, in his lecture on the remember McTaghart in Edinburgh in 2003, invited BBC to sell EastEnders series.
Johnson noted that more harmful public BBC transfers “are continuing to go to BBC4, where there is often no evaluation of the audience, but therefore the company's function has been performed, and this can be presented as an argument in the Hungarian sermons that justify the income from licensing fees at 4 billion pounds: “Yes, of course, we are doing all these unfavourable transfers that no one sees.”
They put them in locks where no one will ever see them.
Regarding the licensing assembly, Johnson informed the Committee: "I call on you to find a more regressive system as to who will receive the most from it.
Of course, you all think that we all think that 150 pounds a year is a huge amount, but for people who have 150 pounds a great deal of money, I'm curious, because they don't really look at and listen to BBC.
Former Executive Director of Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also spoke before the committee last Tuesday, said that BBC should review Rita's mission to “inform, educate and entertain”.
He noted that only a small part of the BBC material released is now formally classified as educational - according to him, it is 1% of the television content and 0.1% of the radio - and that the company should take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the “information, education and entertainment”.
Elstein noted that BBC should make more efforts in such areas as the “Prominent Concerts” (only part of them, he said, are shown on TV) and enter alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for online viewing.
Sonnogenetics allows brain cells to control by means of sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction when they are affected by sound impulses.
Scientists have extracted worms from a genetically modified nervous system that can be managed using sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction at the moment they are affected by sound impulses too high to be heard by the human ear.
Impulses affect by activating neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
More on the subject: Researchers manage brain activity through light
Scientists have said that worms demonstrate the possibility of a new method called sonnogenetics, which is essentially used to initiate certain brain, heart and brain cells, while the source of ultrasound is outside the body.
Srikant Chalasani, a scientist at the Institute of Salta, La Hoya, California, told the Guardian that this method could once replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the brain and used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
The nematode worms usually do not respond to the ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to react when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles were intensifying ultrasonic waves that then penetrate the worms.
Increased ultrasonic waves affect the structures called “TRP-4 ion channels” found in the membranes of some worm cells.
The ultrasonic waves force these ion channels to open and initiate cells associated with them, as reported in the Nature Communications report.
In order to create no sites that can be managed by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications to the worms, so their motor neurons used the ion channels TRP-4.
During the use of ultrasound to affect modified organisms, sound waves were increased by microscopic bubbles and entered the worms by activating modified motor neurons.
This method is similar to the one used in "optogenetics" - a new direction that allows scientists to include and exclude neurons with light impulses.
Chalasani argues that, compared to this method, sonogenetics may have some advantages.
Unlike the light that is delivered to the right part of the brain by the eyebrows, low-frequency ultrasonic waves pass through the tissues of the body, so they do not have to go inside the skull.
“We believe that, in order to treat some neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will eventually make human neurons sensitive to ultrasound,” Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the method could apply to muscle and insulin-producing cells.

Advertising on British arms trade
Look at the role of Amnesty International in protest against the display of weapons.
Striking drones!
Destructive iron canals!
Casket bombs!
Electrical light-dumps that cause unbearable pain, but do not leave any traces!
The sound voice and cartoons leave no doubt that this advertisement of the largest international exhibition of arms - the single parody prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the intention of the British Government to "press" weapons against repressive regimes using the exhibition of defence technologies and security systems in the centre of ExCeL in Dockland.

But the special campaign also causes the sudden appearance of many posters at bus stops and on subway trains that need to be looked at again.
"An important announcement on the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of the fonts of the London metro with the representation of the DLR line turning into a tank silhouette.
In September this year, a crowd of arms dealers will be on the DLR line. Passengers are asking for help to prevent the display of weapons.
300 posters are designed by artists who have exhibited their work at the "Benefits of Cruel Design" in the "Dismalland" Bank.
By collecting the Special Patrol Group, which has helped spread them across London, using the 6-pound set of gate keys, which is said to “give access to approximately one third of the advertising space on the world's bus stops”.
Transporters in London were not happy with such “vandalism” as unauthorized posters.
One of the Paradise announcements issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and professor at Essex University, artists are becoming more demanding and are seeking to bring political art to an audience outside the gallery.
Many artists start working with protest movement activists, realizing that they have to go into real peace because of their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the display of weapons welcoming passengers in the subway.
The video from Amnesty was viewed more than 100,000 times over 24 hours on Facebook and was created by a VCCP working per bono agency, involving graphic designer and sound artist, also working for free.
The creative director of the VCCP Matt Lever was struck by a silence around the display of weapons - with a break in ExCel calendar - and thought, "Let them set up a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They thought to create more realistic and clever corporate advertising, but "to fill her house with bright colors and animation became a more fascinating occupation".
"They're amazingly helping us to attract attention to the sale of illegal investigative equipment at the exhibition," says Tom Davis of Amnesty.
We now need the British Government to take measures and to ensure that this experimental equipment will not be sold directly at our threshold.
The most creative art on the subject of arms exhibition may be within ExCeL, where participants trade fantastically ephemetic products.
In the press release Saab revealed information on the order for "AT4CS RS for shoulder shooting" from the U.S. Army.
It includes “no similar cumulative weaponry, which has an uninterrupted insurmountable barrier action within the target”.
Whatever he does, it won't be nice.
Eight golden rules of residence in student settlements
It's been 11 years since I moved to the student community as a normal 19-year-old, still believing in bartenders and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the intense smiles of those I've had - and the many, long complaints of others.
Basically, what I learned can be explained by eight simple rules.
Moving to the community can vary from mild to extremely scary nerves.
He's trying to talk: tell people where you came from, whether you took an academic leave and where you took it, whether you support Corbin, and why you "I don't love or hate Marmite," because seriously, guys, it's just a hahaha road extract, I'll be at my place."
Breathe.
And help others to get over it, too, ask questions and show interest.
This will help you to find people who like you, not those who you would not even talk to, even if they were burned with fire.
Give people space.
People's rooms are often turned into drinking facilities, half-night cinemas, and common bunkrooms, but they are also the places where people dress and fix the lower whites.
More on the subject: Don’t even think about starting a university education with relationships
Introverts in universities are unfair.
Your room must be a refuge, but many communities form a culture of Satan from one room to another, which promotes friendship, society and leads to long friendships.
It can be a poison for those who are trying to recover their strength.
Nothing in the culture lets you say, "I like you, and I want to keep friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I was able to restore the energy I spent on communication with you."
Try to feel when the contestant is tired of the community - and don't hit him but text him.
By the way, knock: do it.
One of the guys in my apartment followed the principle: If the door was not locked, he was invited to come in.
He saw something.
Make friends with the help of the cooking.
Since you're starting university life at the peak of the Bake-Off show, you're going to knock on people's door to introduce yourself and teach them a plate of chocolate. It's not that weird thing anymore, it doesn't remind them in the 1950s of their "Good luck, we neighbors, I've got something for you, and now smile, and I'm going to ask you personal questions."
Offering hospitality is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to give up on you, and as a result, your face will likely be associated with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good a baker you are.
Badly blinded worms of pain, sugar and fat will soon make people sleep when you hit them.
Stealing food is a typical crime in student communities.
Of course, assigning someone to a chicken is a robbery, but is this theft to take a hearing-of-the-sucking tea?
Get to the milk owner.
He'll probably suggest you stay out of it, even if it's a bit of anger inside.
If someone cheats on your stuff, it upsets you, and I feel for you, but try to treat this adult more than my neighbor who poured liquid into his milk to wash the dishes to avenge those who took him without asking.
Now she's in prison.
You should not make noises that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be like a man, but also because you're the same people from the proverb about glass houses.
The girl in my corridor asked the neighbor to play the sound of drums and bass guitars, because she had three o'clock in the morning and she had her morning exam.
The neighbors responded by increasing their noise.
When he finally shut up at 5: 00 a.m., she kindly allowed him to sleep for two hours and then knocked on his music and locked the door on his three - hour exam.
Wouldn't it have been romantic if your future husband had settled in the same settlement as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extraordinary, before you bite the balls, even if you took your neighbor for your future wife, got involved in them, broke their relationship, and should have seen him every day, and maybe watched him drag all your common friends on his side?
Of course, you don't order your heart - but if your hot neighbor isn't exactly your future husband, try to cool down your own dust.
At that exciting moment when you realize that someone left the keys inside their own private room, the border between the game and the lawn is thinner than it seems.
A good game is fun, but it turns out to be the opposite of a few seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something - but never pick up a room with a toothpaste and shampoo.
In front of the other door and drop the keys in the water bottle, which you will then put in the freezer - but don't attach the other things to the Blu-Tack stick to the top more than twice.
iOS 9: How to establish a new operating system on the iPhone after an Apple update
The new operating system can be asked to select General by entering Settings and then Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will allow you to jump it and fix it.
Some have encountered problems after installation when an error message was made telling them that "The annex has not been updated".
To avoid this, it is recommended that users either wait until the recovery is over, or try to update through iTunes.
The phone hints will allow you to pass the entire process to the end.
The process could include the removal of applications to increase the free space - but Apple minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the amount of the update, and also facilitated implementation with the help of a special tool that proposes to remove the applications and re-establish them after the completion of the process.
You should make sure that your phone is loaded or located next to the charging device to prevent battery malfunctions.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop updating, as the dialing of the phone in the process may lead to a failure of updating.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity by telephone.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergey Lavrow to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, Moscow ' s military support to President Assad only led to a deepening of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk to a Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
US Secretary-General John Kerry called on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
“The Secretary Kerry has made it clear that the continued support of President Assad by Russia poses a risk of exacerbating and prolonging the conflict, and also negatively affects our common goal of combating extremism, if we do not continue to focus on seeking ways to resolve the Syrian conflict by direct transfer of power,” said the representatives of the US Department.
They also noted that Kerry once again stressed the United States' commitment to combating the Islamic State in a coalition from more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad would never be able to be its member.
In addition, the United States “will be pleased with Russia’s constructive role in trying to resist the Islamic State”.
On Friday, representatives of the White House said they did not know exactly what action the Russian troops were taking in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the issue with Moscow.
However, White House Press Secretary Josh Ernest noted that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had not yet occurred: "When the President decides that the phone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, he will raise the trumpet and try to complete the call."
Barack Obama himself believes that Russia's decision to increase the support for Assad's “perjury rate” regime.
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him it was a mistake that Assad's continued support would only make the situation worse.
"But he has not listened to my warnings - and the situation has deteriorated," said the President of the United States.
Import yachts will be exempt from customs duties.
Mineconomy is intended to temporarily release imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sport from customs duties and taxes.
The corresponding changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free imports were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the RF.
This was reported by the Assistant Minister of Economic Development Elena Laškin.
In June 2015, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, following his visit to Crimea, commissioned a number of departments - Mineconomy, Mintrans, Minkultura, IMI, MCS, FSB, FTS, Rostourism - to prepare proposals for creating favourable conditions for yachting in coastal areas of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their courts abroad - approximately €200 million a year go to the punishment of European States for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Russian Mineconomy has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission on " Amending the List of Goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes", which provides for full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other floating means of recreation and sport.
In the Ministry ' s view, this will certainly contribute to creating favourable conditions for the development of yachts in coastal areas of the country, Laškin noted.
The issue was referred to the Customs and Customs Sub-Commission, non-tariff regulation, protection measures in external trade of the Government Economic Development and Integration Commission, held in September, and was also endorsed by the agencies as a result of the discussion.
As noted by the representative of Mineconomy, the proposed measure for full conditional exemption on importation is, in fact, a benefit.
Therefore, following the adoption of the protocol of the subcommission meeting in the Government of the Russian Federation, the Mineconomy will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with EEA member States, Lašina explained.
The list of imported goods which are completely exempt from customs duties, taxes include the goods necessary to facilitate external economic activities and international cooperation, to apply science, culture, cinematography, sport and tourism, to provide international assistance, etc. - service equipment (personal computers, typewriters), measuring equipment, storm equipment, stage costumes and decorations, moving laboratories and masters, water slides, goose cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and objects for religious ceremonies.
In the press service Mintrans RF “Reports” reported that binding orders had been issued on the ports of Kerchi, Sevastopola, Yalta, Feodosia and Eupathy, which provided for a simplified procedure for the formation and exit of small, sporty, parasitic and pedestrian ships in the seaport.
Mintrans has been commissioned by the masters of the seaports of Crimea to ensure that small-scale, sports-pare and pedestrian ships enter the seaport and exit the ships listed from the seaport.
Mintrans has also prepared draft orders from the Government of RF on the approval of the limits of the Crimean Seaports.
With regard to Yalta and Feodosia, the orders have already been adopted, and the others are in the process of harmonization, as noted in the department ' s press service.
Mintrans believes that the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol should carry out a census, classification and certification of small vessels used for non-commercial purposes.
The problem is that in Russia, yachting was extremely difficult because of poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, it is a whole constantly developing industry, with a large number of people involved.
In Russia, in fact, everything is in place.
Our coast is the only piece of interest where boats can be operated every year is the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Gelenjika, Novorossiska, Anapa.
But the great difficulty is that there are very strict border service rules in this area: a mass of permits must be created in order to get out of the boat.
Besides, inside Russia, you're going to go somewhere.
Two days she can go with her fuel, and then the problem arises where to take it, says the sales director of Nordmarine Denis Novikov.
With regard to boats storage sites, Moscow and St. Petersburg now have special anchors for boats up to 30 metres. The boats are also being shipped to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers were rich people, but when the crisis began, the demand for yachts declined.
The World Bank has granted Ukraine a loan of $500 million.
The World Bank approved a new loan project for Ukraine of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
The press service of the international organization reported.
"The new funding will support a number of priority measures to implement reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," the communication said.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Cimeo Fanh, said that the banking sector ' s reforms would help restore real-economy loans and encourage economic recovery.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank had seen the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the serious problems, Fan calls on the Government of Ukraine to accelerate reforms.
Earlier, the Polish Government approved the grant of a loan of €100 million to Ukraine, according to the RIA News.
Prisons are being asked to create separate blocks for transgenders.
At the Public Council of the Federal Penal Service (FSIN) on the protection of the rights of convicted persons in October 2015, there will be a discussion on the possibility of setting up separate blocs for transgender and transvestite.
A member of the Council of Vladislav Grib told me about this.
In his view, depending on the total number of Russian prisoners not identified by sex, it is possible to provide for separate chambers, blocks or even (if many such criminals are) to establish a special column for trans-sexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that it is possible to define the punishment of citizens in such isolated places only after the convicted have had the appropriate medical expertise to prove that the criminal is indeed a person who identifies himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Governor Grib is confident that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the safety of the executions.
He said that the proposed practice worked well abroad: the SISO (where the accused are before the court's decision) had separate cameras for transgenders, and the correction agencies had special blocks.
Today is the only way to deal with such criminals.
They need to be isolated, since the presence of transvestants and transgender in normal cameras is dangerous for them, suffering for their families and for the sea problems for the staff of the FSIN.
The lowering of traffic by cameras is guaranteed," said Vladislav Grib.
Depending on the size of the city, the number of offenders with an indefinite sex must and should be calculated where to distribute them.
SIZO does not really need individual cameras, blocks in prisons.
Yeah, a separate colony is possible if there's a lot of transgender.
According to Grib, 50 or 100 persons can be held in the bloc, and if a specialized body is established in Russia alone, trans-sexual prisoners will be able to be punished in any region.
The citizen is held at the crime scene in SISO, so the proceeds of transvestice or transgender from other actors during the investigation and trial are unrealistic, and this is the case for those already convicted in a separate colony, yes, considers Grib.
In the past, law enforcement officers had not been able to decide which insulate male or female investigator Dmitria Kojukova, a 24-year-old transgender (known as Alina Davis), had been arrested by a virgin.
He was released at home under a non-exit signature.
This novelty has been widely discussed in social networks and the media, as there is no transgender mechanism in SISO and in Russian colonies.
Russian human rights defender, activist of the LGBT movement (LGBT - lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals) Nikolai Alexeev supported the idea of creating special places to punish transgenders, noting that it is also possible to identify men or women in the colony abroad according to their own wishes.
In view of the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, it is a very small percentage, but there is a problem, as is the issue of security in prisons for homosexuals, says Alexeev.
Prisons should be safe, so separate blocks could be made on behalf of homosexuals, more than transgenders.
In doing so, Alexeev doubted that there would be many citizens in Russia who were willing to give up as transsexuals in order to become separate from the ordinary column.
Of course, a medical examination can be made before we place people in a transgender colony, but not always everything is clear.
For example, in the U.S., a prisoner named Chelsea Manning looked like a man, and already in prison he said he wanted to change sex, said Alexeiev.
A person can feel like anyone.
But as long as there are no separate places to punish transgenders, I doubt that prison officials will think seriously about the safety of such people and find themselves in the darkness of their orientation or gender identification.
At the same time, an international expert on reproductive health in the territory of RF Boris Lordcapanidze noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of trans-sexual offenders in the colony could greatly delay the commencement of the sentence.
The commission is being created, it is a question of sexology, long-term monitoring by psychiatrists, it is not one test based on which a high degree of judgement is being made.
Today's possibilities of psychiatrists allow this.
Therefore, and in front of a gender change, potential patients always go through such experiments - they show exactly whether gender change is a necessary measure of surgery, says Lord Kipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how this system should be implemented with regard to the convicted, as the average survey is months away.
The doctor, although he generally supported the creation of separate blocks for transsexuals, also doubted that it would be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical expertise, transgenders in Russia.
It is difficult to count, there is no official statistics, but if you take into account that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, you can say that transgenders are even smaller, and those who have such a deviation and still commit crimes are quite small, said Lord Kipanidze.
Now, at the request of the Homosexual columnist, transgenders can obtain certain conditions of content.
Michael Antipov won the Junior World Chess Championship.
In Huntie Mansijske, the world's chess championship has been completed among young people under 20 years of age.
The finish of the championship was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last tour, and he became a Russian Michael Antipov, who was still trying to push the Pole Jan-Chishtof Dud, who would certainly go to the title.
The girls celebrated the victory by Ukrainian chessman Natalie Bux.
The world's chess championship, which had been held since the beginning of September in Hunti Mansijske, had seemed to have lost almost all of its intrigue since the representative of Poland, Jan-Kschistof Doda, who issued a series of four victories (the competitions carried out by the Swiss system in 13 tours) had certainly taken the lead.
Given that Duda was the favorite of the championship, even though he was considered to be one of the most promising young chessmen, the probability that he would lose his winning match seemed very insignificant.
And even when Doda released the traffic and allowed Russian Mihail Antipov to reduce the delay to just 0.5 balls, he remained a clear favourite in the fight for title.
In order to reach the leader, Antipo had to win the 13th tour.
But it wouldn't even help you win your party.
Plus, this obligation of victory could, of course, affect the Russian chess team and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Michael Antipov was able to avoid them.
He was sure to deal with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he was forced to wait until his party was finished.
Luckily for Antipo's sake, the Polish chessman fought with the Dutchman at night.
Thus, Antipov and Duda obtained an equal number of points - 10 of 13 possible, but Antipova had the best additional indicators.
That is why the leadership of the Hanti Mansian Autonomous District, whose governor, Natalya Comarov, traditionally devoted great attention to the development of chess in the region, gave him the main prize.
And that's not what happened in the competitions of girls with an intriguing concussion.
The leader of the tournament - Natalie Buxe (Ukraine) - was enough not to lose the title in the last round, which she successfully did.
Thus, the victory of Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to reach Bux.
The Russian sport remained the second with a drop from the champion in 0.5 balls.
The gap changes the regional structure.
The company unites the Privolgian and Ural regions in one group of Volgian and Ural regions, Siberia and the Far East, in the Eastern region.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
As G.W. Michael Slobodin said, the changes are being made to “remain a strong player in the market”, to develop a company “in new, not always favorable external conditions”.
In an interview with the 24th Russian television channel, Mr. Slobodin stated that he intended to reduce the ten per cent staff in Russia.
The plant supervisor checked 78 Moscow's Burger King breakfasts and issued 367 regulations.
As a result, the Volokolam Show restaurant was fined 50 thousand rubles and the Big Tull Street facility was closed for 90 days, but resumed after all violations were eliminated.
43 breakfasters violated the requirements for the room device.
Among other violations, unsatisfactory sanitary and sanitary content of the premises, non-compliance with ventilation requirements, bacteria of the oxygen panel have been found in some establishments.
Franchisa on the brand Burger King is owned by the OOO Burger Russ, owner of the chocolate network, Alexander Kolobov, and works 293 breakfasts in Russia.
Igor Artemiev, head of the FAS, said that the agency against the indexation of 10 per cent of the freight charges and the provision of subsidies, as requested by the OAU.
At first, they wanted 17 per cent of the index, now they want 10 per cent, and even billions of budget grants, he said.
We say: It's wrong, it's too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, give up expensive individuals, football teams, own TV, stop spending money on the left and right.
He added that FAS had its own, much more stringent proposals that were now being discussed in the Government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net-account option with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of a full-scale stake option of $300 million, the gold mining company reported.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the issue price for Sumeru and market quotes) which can be taken from the free cash flow.
Sumeru has time until 3 October to make an option or to make a claim.
The details of the negotiations in Polymetal are not disclosed.
The option was made within the framework of the purchase of Polymetal project "Kizil" in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasishin, director of the Department of Housing Policy of Minstro, reported that the Ministry, together with the CB, is developing a system of repair of the contractors.
"We understand that there is nowhere to go, so we are developing an appropriate mechanism," said the officer.
The black screens of the "Gradden Kane" film are on the market.
The auction house's Profilees in History reported plans to launch a black version of the "Graddan Kane" film, which is considered one of the best productions by the director, screenwriter and actor of Orson Wells.

The second black is a more complete version of the script, the third is the final plan of the film.
Minpromorg: Addressing food aid will not be the same as cards in the USSR.
The Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia, Viktor Eutuchov, reported that the programme of targeted food aid would not be the same as the map distribution system in the USSR.
This is a modern address for food aid to the population and the support of an effective domestic freighter.
I'm asking you not to speculate on the word "food card."
It should be noted, in particular, that the proposed product maps should not be confused with the overdue period of total deficit, the distribution system map, where the number of products received is regulated.
We have so far proposed the concept, if it is approved, we will propose amendments to the legislation," says Mr. Euttuhova.
Previously, “U” wrote that a food card programme for the poor had been introduced to the Government.

This year's study of the Association of Russian Managers "Top-1000 Russian Managers" is scheduled for the 16th time.
As an instrument for assessing the professional reputation of the Russian senior management, the study has led to the results of the work of the Russian administrations annually, identifying leaders in the industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of winners of last year's rating.
The winners of last year are invited to confirm their participation as candidates for the current year ' s rating and to appoint members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates included in the initial list of candidates proposes to appoint up to ten new managers from other companies, which would be useful to add to the overall pool of candidates.
The following company's executive directors may be deployed: Financial Director, Commercial Director, Marketing Director, Personnel Director, IT Director, Public and Corporate Relations Director, Authority Director, Corporate Management Director.
Each proposed expert is invited by the manager to participate in the rating and is given an opportunity to raise his management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
The award of industrial candidates is based on the industrial classification of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forest and forestry industries, machinery, media, metallurgicals, multi-profile holding, professional services, communications and telecommunications, consumer goods, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is provided with a login and password to access www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information about the other participants and can submit their evaluations according to the proposed criteria for each functional direction.
The rating building methodology is based on the "Best Choices" principle: Top Managers appreciate top managers, Functional Managers appreciate functional managers.
Such a principle enables the highest authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating were approved at the meetings of the expert commissions.
The meetings of the expert commissions are open to all desired candidates for the current year ' s rating and multiple candidates for the last year ' s rating.
The Commission shall be organized on a functional basis: a list of senior managers approval commissions and eight functional direction approval commissions.
Meetings of the expert commissions are invited to approve the lists submitted in alphabetical order (places remain strictly according to the Internet assessment and are closed prior to the publication of the rating) or to update them according to the list of reserve candidates attached.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the rules of “U”.
At the time of publication of the rating, possible changes in the status of managers and companies.
The comfortable rate for the investment rate is 10-13 per cent.
According to experts, the credit market for small and medium-sized businesses in January-April this year rose by 40 per cent.
What do you think is the situation today?
Following the panic of the end of 2014 - beginning of 2015, the lending of ISBs has decreased significantly.
The reason is the sharp increase in interest rates.
The 25-30 per cent annual credit was not beneficial to anyone.
If the bank had previously been able to raise all its possible problems further, from the deadline to the return, it could not have done so now: the rates and so cloudy.
For business, the current rate of ISB credit is uncomfortable.
For a large part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable from the point of view of their employability.
The rate of 10-13 per cent would allow the business to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive income.
How much do you estimate meet the demand for credit from entrepreneurs?
After a decrease in the percentage of CBs, the situation improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers have turned to credit for a lot of cuts.
First of all, business does not understand the prospects for its development and future income.
Today, business has one way out: we need to learn to work, focusing on today's economic situation in the country and region.
It is necessary to monitor more closely the current results, monitor the flow of money.
At the same time, where financial resources are available, new technologies should be used to modernize equipment, reduce production and energy costs.
All of this, in the end, enables companies to make products more competitive and to keep business even in a unstable economic situation.
What major trends in the ISB credit market will be strengthened and will affect its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The average rate reduction forecast will depend largely on the Central Bank ' s policy, and now the regulator is demonstrating consistency in the issue of the key rate reduction.
However, there is no need to expect a radical fall in the credit price for ICB.
In the current situation, inflation is, in particular, a problem that makes it necessary to raise the rate of real income.
Moreover, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even if the CB rates are reduced.
When it comes to the level of overtime, traditional small and medium-sized businesses, limited both in cash and in economic behaviour adjustment options, would certainly be a major risk to creditors.
I would not expect a substantial reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country ' s economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That is how the word Mazda is written by Japanese hieroglyphs.
Beautiful, laconic and at the same time quite difficult for those who are accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.
As well as the new CX-5 crossword puzzle, as well as any other brand model: without skill attractive outside, technically made inside.
The Japanese simply because of its "Japanese" is able to link the products of the rising sun to the state of full alert.
How easy it is to put arguments in favour of cars from other countries, and people will even agree with those arguments, but all the talk will spread from the final phrase: "But this is a Japanese car!
Don't argue about it!
Such people must probably love not only technology but everything else in Japan.
Citing the bass, bringing food to the tubs, collecting catacombs and putting on your girlfriend - not in kimonos, of course, but in Japanese street fashion: nice, creative and very unexpected.
Please, Japanese school form is the only form that girls are happy to carry after school.
It has amazing properties, both both sensitive and strict.
And the older the girl, the more beautiful the short.
Main change in the outside CX-5 is a five-horizontal radiator grid.
But where does the car change the shape of the new picture of the headlamps and the rear lamps that the car is currently aware of in the flow of cars?
As before, Mazda CX-5 looks very misleading.
Siluette is harmonious, sensitive, but the appearance is tight.
There's no need to call the police.
Under the CX-5 rule, one of the safest in the world can be experienced only by standing Japanese peace.
The 2.2 litre diesel engine provides a high torque in the wide range of speeds.
The fuel consumption of this engine is 175 litres of power, total of 5.9 litres. The power unit is exclusively automatic transmission and complete.
Black shoes, black coat, black bag...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can choose leggins with a print from the Not Cross police chain.
In Mazda, however, they have made every effort to ensure that you are not in the position of your own DTP.
In order to increase comfort, while maintaining excellent governance, the substations have been transformed into front and rear shock absorbers, as well as optimized the shape of the front and rear drawers.
The full system is adapted under Russian conditions.
The noise level of the road and the engine at high speed is reduced by 13 per cent.
The bathroom in a flower shop or a closet is just as boring as the budget desk.
It's another case that a girl is growing up in a bathroom with an original drawing.
For example, from a computer game in the role-playing genre.
She'll get no less attention then than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has improved design for both front and rear seats, which provides optimal space for both wide shoulders and long legs.
The long-standing likely estimate is that the tensions in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not hit the sides in the expression.
The widest set of active safety systems in Mazda is proposed at CX-5.
Radars, lasers and cameras are used here to identify potential threats.
There is both adaptive lighting and warning of the exit from the fields, and monitoring of dead zones, and safe braking.
Mazda CX-5 is one of the best luggage in the class.
The comfortable, with minimum performances, replaces the load with 561 litres. The rear seats are in the ratio of 4:2:4 - each section is equipped with a separate outlet - and increases the luggage compartment to 1560 litres.
The costume of a multifilm hero in Japan is called "kigurums."
It looks particularly expensive.
It can do anything!
Of course I do.
But it's still about entertaining little kids.
Or just walk around like that on the street...
It's so cool when there's a choice of dress, behavior or car.
Thank you for your help with the preparation of the Kawaicat store.
Kiev has destroyed the atomic union.
Kiev officially refused to cooperate with Russia on the settlement of the Hmelnikka AES.
The Supreme Council, on Wednesday, voted in favour of the dissolution of the agreement with Moscow.
Arrangements for the alignment of the third and fourth blocs were signed in 2010-2012, but the project failed.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Council of Ukraine adopted a law breaking down the agreement with the RF in 2010-2012 on the construction of the third and fourth block in the Hmelnicka AES.
The draft law introduced by the Government was successful only with a second vote, with 210 Members supporting it for the first time, at a minimum of 226, but then 234 members of Parliament voted in favour of the draft.
The initial project Hmelnikka AES, based in the USSR, had to have four 1 GW power blocks with VWR-type reactors, but only two were able to build.
The accession negotiations with Moscow led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010 and the Council adopted the relevant laws in 2011-2012.
Since there was no funds in Ukraine's budget, it was expected that the building of blocks would be subject to a loan from the Russian side, but the funds had not been allocated.
After the revolution in Kiev in February 2014, and following that cooling in relation to the two countries, Kiev began to engage in relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, declaring its refusal to cooperate on the Hmelnik AES and on the construction project in Ukraine of the nuclear fuel plant.
The only area where relations remained was the purchase of fuel in the RF fuel for the Ukrainian AES (which provided about half of the country's electricity generation), as the Ukrainian NAEC "Energoat" replaced Russian supplies with something.
The Hmelnikka AES settlement plans with the other contractor in Ukraine have not been finally rejected: negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS were announced in Kiev in 2014.
UN Gensec against the use of military force in the resolution of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Pan Ki-moon reported during the press conference that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
“There is no military solution”, the AP responds to the question of Syria’s military support from Russia.
Mr. Gui Mun also announced that he would meet with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the heads of the mid-countries of the permanent members of the UNSCR later this month.
"The meeting will be in Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief of the Genstab VS Russia Nikolai Bogdanovski reported that Genstab did not rule out the possibility of establishing a future WSB base in Syria.
There are no such plans yet.
"But anything can be," said Mr. Bogdanovski.
Previously, U reported that the United States did not trust the President of Russia Vladimir Putin, who stated that military assistance to official Damascus was needed to combat the FP-banned terrorist group, the Islamic State.
For more details on the concerns of the United States regarding Russia's Russian assistance, read "U" in "The Russian military presence in Syria concerns Washington."
The OSCE report on the possible meeting of the parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia in PAP.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA) informed Arthur Gerasim of the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentarians to discuss the situation in the south-east of Ukraine.
"What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," says Mr. Gerasimova.
He also called for mine agreements and for “returning to the normal vitality of our countries”.
On the question of whether it is possible, in his view, to present a dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level - either in "Norman format" or in the format of a contact group at the OSCE P.A. - Mr. Gerasim noted that the dialogue took place, there were mine agreements.
At the same time, policies say, in Kiev, they support any kind of dialogue.
The former representative of Ukraine in the negotiations, the former President of the country, Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-declared Donetsk and Lugansk Republic had not, in principle, changed their positions in the tripartite negotiations, but the tone of dialogue had become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the Electoral Commission of Lower Newtown held the city council elections on the municipal district, distributing 12 parliamentary mandates played on the party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of violations in the elections were made by representatives of the CRC, who accused the election of “covering falsifications”.
No comments on the opposition were adopted.
Together with the election, the Communists of Russia refused to hold a referendum on the abolition of multiple-quartered homes.
The City Election officially presented the results of the elections in the pride of Lower New York on the municipal electoral district.
A total of 1.03 million voters were included in the list of voters in Lower Newtown, 746.7 thousand ballot papers were issued and 268 thousand voters voted.
More than 11.7 thousand ballots were declared invalid and 24 lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were allocated to political parties, depending on their votes.
According to the lists of "One Russia" six MPs in pride are Dmitry Swatkovski, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasil Supranov, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Wiacheslav Rasteryev and Igor Nagorno.
The only mandate of the LDPR was given by the leader of the party Vladimir Girinovski.
The two mandates of the CRC are allocated between Vladimir Bulanov and Mr. Alexander Tarnaev.
The three mandates of "Just Russia" are given to Alexander the Duchy, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must determine whether they will work as deputies in the city of town: in the event of refusal of the mandate, they will move to the following candidate on the ballot.
The chairman of the Alexander Makeev Hill informed the members of the Commission that he had introduced a mandate for "transmission to Girinov and other telegrams" to refuse the mandates.
In adopting the protocol on the outcome of the elections, the representatives of the CRC reported multiple violations.
A member of the meeting room from the CRC, Leonid Krasnokutski, suggested not to acknowledge the results of the vote in four districts No.21-24, recalling that, at the order of the Head of Administration of the Sormov Region, the entrance to the administration building was closed, with four district commissions.
Within a long period of time, neither the members of the Gos Duma, nor the candidates themselves, nor the observers, and the resonance scandal at the front door of the administration were shown on television.
At the meetings of the district commissions, all observers and members of the commissions with the right to vote had the opportunity to attend.
Their head had ceased access only when the vote was completed and the local commissions had not yet arrived to submit their ballots.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
"Then the head was repaired, and at all meetings interested persons could be present," a member of the Andrhuschin chose mountain.
The Communists objected that more than four hours had been unlawfully detained in the blocked administration building of the Ludmil Aristov Congregation, which was referred to the Committee of Inquiry.
The opposition was also upset that, on the day of the elections, a number of WICs began to print the urns at 6-7 a.m. in the morning, giving them their ballots for an early vote.
However, the members of the commissions with the right to a meeting vote and observers had not been notified, so they had already arrived at the beginning of the election at 8 a.m.
Communists are convinced that in the morning before the opening of the polling stations, ballots could be thrown out of control.
However, the mountain, which has already dealt with more than 124 complaints for various reasons, says Alexander Makeev, has not found any violations of the release of unrecorded ballots.
Members of the Commission and his colleague Maria Popovov's proposal from the Justice of Russia did not support the adoption of amendments to regional legislation, so as to make it clear that there would be time for the opening of early ballot ballots, which would then fall into the loop.
"On your own initiative, contact the CIC at least," advised Mrs. Popova Alexander Makeev.
At the end of the meeting, a member of the CRC, Sergey Samohin, who called for the election to ignore the dozens of complaints and to cover forging in the elections.
"You're not here at the meeting, be careful!" was the president of the election.
The protocol was adopted almost unanimously.
By 27 September, the general results of the elections were to be approved, followed by the first meeting of the City Hall of Lower Newtown of the Sixth Call within three weeks.
In addition to determining the results of the elections, the City Electoral Commission rejected the political party of the Communists of Russia in registering an initiative group to hold a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were going to raise two questions for the discussion of the lower citizens: do they agree that the tax collection of multi-quartered houses needs to be “cut off immediately” and the rates for residential and municipal services “frozen by 2020”.
However, Irina Maslov's lawyer explained that the treatment of the Communists of Russia was contrary to the law.
The FedEx version is mixed, downsizing the 2016 forecast.
FedEx reported the disturbing results of the last quarter, and the delivery service giant reduced the forecast of annual income due to the drop in demand for freight services and increased costs in its ground transportation.
The company also stated that it was planning to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
At the same time, FedEx reported last year that he would hire 50,000 temporary workers for holidays.
Its shares amounted to approximately 2.5 per cent in preliminary trades in 45 minutes before the opening of the stock exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that he was planning to earn from $10.40 to $10.90 in the financial year ending next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts estimated $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
The forecast has been reduced despite an average rate rise of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and an increase in the charges for the land transport of heavy or gabarite goods beginning in November.
The company stated that it was still planning to increase its cost compared to last year by reducing costs, increasing gross income and increasing online trade.
The President and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company “was stable in the light of the weak, compared to the forecast, economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and world trade”.
The work force plans for the holidays were announced the following day after the competitor ' s statement, UPS, that they were planning to hire 95,000 additional staff, approximately as much as they had been employed last year.
For the quarter that ended on 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 per cent more than a year ago.
The share income was $2.42, close to the projected average of $2.44 for the Zacks Investment Research survey of 12 analysts.
Income increased by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts questioned Zacks estimated $1.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has suffered from a fall in the urgent international transport sector, resulting in a lack of gross income in its express transport unit.
However, the purchase boom on the Internet has greatly improved the results in FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the cost of land transport increased by 29 per cent, but operating income remained unchanged due to increased costs for large shipments and self-insurance.
The transport unit received higher income due to higher base rates, while income in the freight sector fell due to increased labour costs.
In the preliminary trades, about an hour before the opening of the FedEx stock exchange, there was a fall of $3.85 or 2.5 per cent, up to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, falling by 11 per cent per year and by 17 per cent below the record of 11 June.
At the most expected meeting in several years, the Federal Reserve System leaders will hold two days a week at a 27-foot table from the Honduras red tree, deciding whether to raise the key percentage for the first time in almost ten years.
At one end of a richly decorated room for two-storey high-level meetings, they will be painted by the United States.
This map is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve System, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues, must place the economic interests of the country above all others.
The Central Bank has received a double mandate from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and to maintain stable prices here.
But since the Great Depression, the leaders of the Federal System have recognized that there is also a third unwritten order: financial stability.
And this third commission may be an unknown factor in the almost projected decision, which will be announced on Thursday, whether the US economy is prepared to refrain from the unprecedented incentive provided by the almost zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most data show a strong growth in the economy, recent shocks on world financial markets can also deter the Federal System ' s leaders from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds, even at only a fourth percentage point.
"It is obvious that the labour market and inflation will become the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsey M. Piegs, chief economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"At the same time, I think that if they wanted a reason not to raise the rate of rising uncertainty around the world market, it would be enough to justify them waiting forward," she remarked.
There is no consensus on what they will do in the Federal Reserve System, which in itself provokes fluctuations in the financial market.
Approximately half of the economists who have recently been interviewed in Bloomberg predicted an increase in the interest rate this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal system to refrain from this, while the key indicator shows only about 30 per cent of the probability of rapid take-off.
This may lead to a decline in the stock market if the Federal system raises the rate, provided that the decision-makers do not mitigate the impact of the promise that the next increase will be soon.
The Doo-Johns index rose on Tuesday to 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599.85.
The flight was prompted by expectations that the Federal System Strategy would be left at a rate this week, said John Lonski, the leading economist for Moody's Capital Markets Research.
"It will be a surprise if the Federal system increases rates at this point in time," he remarked.
If this is done by the Federal Reserve System, “they will have to go far into adopting their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so that they do not panic”.
Other experts objected that the increase in the rate could calm down financial markets, as this would leave uncertainty as to how the Federal system would operate.
A whole month ago, the Federal system seemed to be willing to raise a rate of 0.25 per cent this month, making the first small step in slow financial upheaval, which could confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she was expecting an increase in the rate this year, despite the Liberal complaints that greater economic progress was needed.
Although the emergence of new jobs had slowed in August, the labour market growth was stable this year.
Unemployment decreased to 5.1 per cent last month, which was the lowest rate in more than seven years, and almost at the level considered to be full employment in the Federal system.
The increase in wages shows signs of acceleration.
And while inflation continues to be below the target of the central bank at 2 per cent of the year's annual rate, the Federal System's management stated that the key factor was the temporary effect of a sharp fall in oil prices.
The economy "can and needs higher rates, taking into account labour market reductions," observed Ian Sheferdson, chief economist Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world were shaking at the end of last month, after China had devalued its currency.
The Dou-Johns average index for the shares of industrial companies fell by a total of 16 per cent relative to a record high in May, as investors feared that China ' s slowdown could slow global growth.
The market has partially restored its position this month, and the Doo-Johns index now accounts for about 10 per cent below its peak.
In order to guide the Federal Reserve System, market disturbances are further complicated by the difficult calculation of the interest rate increase.
“In the absence of any information about what happened in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would have been turning their backs on this meeting,” said Steven D. Oliner, senior researcher UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Federal Reserve System Officer.
Now, according to his forecasts, they will at least wait a month to gain more control over the consequences.
“There is a great uncertainty as to the impact on the American economy, and they have almost no reliable data since the recent developments in China,” said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not the main concern of the Federal System, and it should not be technically taken into account in the adoption of these decisions.
In essence, however, the Federal Reserve System has become the world financial authority.
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
Only one hint from then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal reserve system could “smooth out” its monetary expansion caused market shocks around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, it could be expected that the leaders of the Federal Reserve System will not only monitor developments everywhere but also consult representatives of other Central Banks and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process -- “s earlier art than science” -- noted Zakari Carabello, head of Envestnet Inc., a company that is engaged in global state management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, President of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank, Virginia, noted this month that “there have been cases of an excessive reaction in the history of the Federal Reserve System to the movement of the financial market, which appears to be unrelated to economic principles”.
Laker, a member with the right to vote of the influential Federal Open Market Committee, as an example, introduced decisions 1998-99.
The financial crisis in Asia led to the Federal system lowering its base rate by 0.75 per cent for three meetings, “in spite of limited identified implications for growth in the United States”, said Laker.
The federal system leaders cancelled these reductions a year later.
The Federal Reserve System should be the first to address stability only in times of major crises, such as the collapse of the market in 2008," said Adam S. Pozen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate committee.
The last panic didn't get close to this level, he said.
"Of course you wouldn't want to be in a situation where you're afraid of rising rates because markets are in shock," said Pozen, President of Peterson's World Economic Institute.
The Federal Reserve System Act continues to have a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I do not think that it should be avoided.

Speaker Mr. Sergey Narishkin admits that the United States is deliberately destabilising the situation in the Middle East so that the waves of refugees can flee to Europe.
As Interfax refers, he gave such an opinion to journalists in Ulan-Bator during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not the proponent of conspirological theories, but I wonder whether Europe is the ultimate goal of those who have destabilized the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East in recent years?" he asked.
"It is likely that someone has imagined and knew that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and disadvantaged people who are saved from death, will reach out to the well-being of the EU countries," he added.
Narishkin wondered: "Did many European political leaders express themselves openly about the causes of this crisis, the concern of refugees who are now literally ravaging their countries?"
"No, old Europe, except rarely, prefers to be silent," he remarked.
According to Narishkin, NATO supports many European values and norms of international law.
“Europe has, unfortunately, long and impartially seen and seen how the military sappog, which has been cut down by NATO standards, is also speeding up moral ideals and fundamental principles and norms of international law,” the speaker stressed.
The opposition of the rebels, mainly of the Islamists, to the government forces and their loyal military formations.
Later, the "Islamic State" terrorist group, which was banned in Russia, joined the opponents of the Syrian Government.
The United States is supporting the rebels, who are opposed to both Assad and IG.
Official Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
The President of Syria called the cause of the unfavorable West to Russia.
The Western claims to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign States.
That was the view expressed by Syrian President Bashar Assad in an interview with RT, First Channel, "Russian 24", NTV, "Russian Today", TASS, "Interfax" and "Russian Paper".
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners and sovereign States.
In these countries, he would like to remove one person and put another to his place, which would act for the Western countries rather than for his Family, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the sharp development of Western media with the beginning of the revolution in Ukraine.
He said that for them the President of Russia Vladimir Putin “has become an enemy of the West, the King, the dictator who is pushing the Russian opposition, which has come to power in a non-democratic way, despite being elected by democratic elections recognized in the West.”
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the continued statements of the West that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the President came to power with the consent of the people through elections, and if so, on the request of the people, not on the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva communiqué.
"If the people want him to stay - the president stays - and otherwise he should leave immediately," he stressed.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled their cooperation.
Syria is also fighting terrorism together with neighbouring Iraq.
Referring to Iran ' s military support, the Syrian leader noted that the Syrian State supported Syria ' s policies, economies and military spheres.
He rejected the claim that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is providing us with military technology.
"Of course, there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been made," he explained.
With regard to other States, we are open to cooperation with any of them, with a strong desire to fight terrorism.
"We do not see this in the case of a so-called anti-terrorist and anti-terrorist coalition known as the United States," Assad said.
The number of people killed exceeds 230 thousand, the number of refugees is 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was seized by a terrorist group called the Islamic State, which was banned in Russia.
The International Coalition in Head of the United States is hitting the IG from the air.

Reuters reported this with reference to the representative of Mr. John Kirby.
It is noted that the topic of the discussion was a conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide any additional details.
He said that the United States had instruments for “a further isolation of Russia”, if it supported President Bashar Assad of Syria, he handed over the RIA News.

Brody called the U.S. newspaper a curse on the Arrow.
The former president of the Government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic of Alexander Borodya rejected the information published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
That's what he said on the phone interview with the correspondent "Lentya.ru".
The note in Washington Post is beautiful because it's all completely twisted.
The former Minister of Defence Igorja Strelkova, of course, did not link and "extend" him from the territory of the Donbass Republic in a very subordinated mood, without chains, without three furs of money that were attributed to him by different characters," he said.
According to Borodya, the thing about Shooting was really going on with the reporter of the American newspaper.
"Yes, I said that the Arrow was urgently required to remove the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," said the former head of the Government of the DNR.
Borody stressed that he did not know why the correspondent of the American publication decided to write that the Arrows had been exported to the Russian "linked" territory.
I suspect it's a provocation.
If it's not a provocation, it's an amazingly misunderstood word, because I stressed that the Arrows were alone," he observed.
"That's a curse to me and to the Arrow," he concluded.
Earlier on the pages of The Washington Post, an article in which Borodya was quoted as saying that he had taken Arrowkov to the territory of Russia in a coercive manner.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he was forced to bind his associate.
The Polish authorities began to search for a train with the gold of the Nazis.
Polish forests began to cut down trees over the underground tunnel, where it is said that there is a train with the gold of the Third Reich.
The work began on Tuesday, September 15, Reuters reported.
According to military experts, it is necessary to clear the forest in order to verify the reliability of rail traffic reports with treasures.
Within trains, weapons and valuable minerals can be found.
On 31 August, the Governor of the Polish Lower Silesia Tomas Smolarz (Tomasz Smolarz) suggested that the new evidence of the existence of a golden train would not be more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities have decided to remove the search area.
Three days earlier, Poland's Deputy Minister of Culture Petr. Zükhovski stated that local treasurers with a "99 per cent probability" found the same third-rich gold train as the legends.
Jukhovski noted that if the assumptions were confirmed and the values were found, they would become the property of a state sentence, and the treasures would not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two legal firms approached the authorities of the Polish city of Valbži, reporting that they had found a train in a frozen tunnel at a depth of 70 metres.
The Chief Narcotics Officer of the Federal Republic of Germany proposed banning the sale of tobacco to persons under the age of 21.
The Russian Chief Narcoticist suggested banning the sale of tobacco under the age of 21.
Eugene Brun noted that before that age, “loved psychoactive substance — tobacco, alcohol, drugs — has been particularly harmful”.
So he said in the direct atmosphere of the Moscow Radio station, commenting on the information that the speaker of Soffeda Valentina Matvienko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21.
Man is growing unevenly.
You can serve in the army for 18 years, a person physically ready to do so.
He has been mentally ready for full life in society for 21 years.
"It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry will eventually grow to 21 years," said Brun.
Previously, a member of the Public Palace and the head of the Treswa Russia project Sultan Hamzaev told the News, that Matvinko supported the initiative to increase the age of alcohol sales and “agreed with the Public House to re-raise the issue in the upper chamber of Parliament”.
According to the activist, the Council of the Federation will soon establish a working group to develop a bill under the direction of Matvienko.
The Bible has been asked to check for compliance with the Child Protection Act
The resident of Novosibirska asked the Regional Prosecutor's Office to check the Bible for compliance with the Federal Law on the Protection of Children from Information That Causes Health and Development," said correspondent Sib.fm.
The author of the application stated that on 26 August 2015 he obtained a Bible at the Chinese City Store in the Red Perspective, published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society.
In his book, he found fragments that, in his view, violated the FZ on the protection of children from information that is harmful to their health and development.
On 16 September, a statement was adopted to be considered by Novosibirsk ' s procurator ' s office.
The response to the treatment of Novosibirska will take 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
Much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, the complainant commented to the correspondent Sib.fm.
Moreover, it is a fundamental problem that society will face.
It will begin to read the Bible, which has not been done before.
Brazilian Paediatric Union of Rio Grandes promotes healthy nutrition for breast-feeding
The Brazilian Paediatric Organization SPRS has developed a scandalous method to convince women of the need for full nutrition during breast-feeding: the method implies the demonstration of images of young breast-feeding children.
The breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
In the context of high energy requirements, pregnant and pregnant women are recommended to increase their daily calorie rate by approximately 500 calories per day.
However, the recent study shows that one increase in calories is not the only change in the diet that mothers should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, professor of medicine at Baylor College in Texas, found that healthy nutrition of pregnant women actually affects the expression of genes in children and prevents them from developing more easily.
Unfortunately, adverse effects of malnutrition on the immune system of the child have been identified.
There was a school bus under Hamburg.
Near Hamburg, the train broke into a school bus, which stopped by the railway.
The 23-year-old driver, aware that he could not move from the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute later, they had a seizure in their eyes.
One of the schoolchildren recorded him on the video.
As a result of an accident, panic broke out among students.
Some children began to cry and run along the coast.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, no one was affected by a miracle except for one train passenger who was injured easily.
Accident damage was estimated at 300 thousand euros.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The management of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) called for the ban on boxing in the country after the death of the young local athlete David Brown.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died from the trauma he suffered alone with Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles of the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg on Friday ended with the victory of Magali in the 12th round.
Brown got into a brain-brained hospital.
Its condition was assessed as critical and was connected to a life-saving device.
Brown won 22 victories at the professional ring, suffered two defeats, and one battle ended at night.
He's got two kids left.
This is already the second case of the summer outing among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, a 23-year-old student named Bradon Smith graduated from the ring.
Now, AMA recommends not to engage in sports, but rather, from its point of view, to ban them at all.
I understand that this is happening unintentionally, said the Vice-President of Steven Parniss.
But as there is now a boxing, there will always be situations where a sportsman gets bleeding or brain injury, which leads to either death or serious injury.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that unites practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Narishkin called on the OSCE to abolish sanctions against RF parliamentarians.
Speaker Gosmunda RF Sergey Narishkin called the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians.
He said so, speaking at the OSCE PA session in Ulan-Bator.
We consider this to be an unacceptable act, an act of interference with the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
"And this should not be repeated, because it is a manifestation of political intolerance and ignoring the principles of open international dialogue," said the politician.
In addition, Narishkin called on the parties to the OSCE to restore the Russian and EU partnership.
Let's get the morals back to politics.
Let us return dialogue and the right to practice international communication.
Let's return humanistic ideals to democratic order.
"Two things never ended well," he said.
Speaking from the Parliamental Assembly tribunal, the Speaker of the Russian Gosmund called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-Parliamental contact group on Ukraine.
I call on members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security tasks.
"First, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our inter-Parliamentary group," Narishkin said.
He also noted the need to pay tribute to the OSCE.
"This is almost the only common area where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," the politician stressed.
Remember, the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulan-Bator, and will extend until 18 September.
I've enjoyed winning for a couple of days.
The World Championship on Easy Athletics Sergey Shubenko.
This season can be called a triumphal for a 24-year-old lightweight from Barnaul Sergey SUBENKOVA.
He managed at his crown distance 110 meters with barriers to win the European Command Championship, to establish several scores, and mainly to become a world champion, the first in the history of the family barrier.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final phase of the "Brilliant League", taking the third place in general.
"New News" asked Shubenko to share the impressions of the falling season.
Sergey, the season for you isn't over yet?
Yes, I'm going to go to the World War Games that will take place in October in Korea, and then I'm going to think about rest.
True, I'll be ready now at home in Barnaul, and being at home is a completely different situation.
It's easier than going around the world every week.
You once said that the autumn was a lovely time of the year for you.
At the end of August, the beginning of September was a wonderful time.
The passions after the main start of the season have disappeared, and the load of responsibility is no longer running.
You can be flattered, at the "slabon."
Plus, you know you'll be leaving soon.
What about fatigue?
Still a special season, a lot of positive emotions...
Steadyness at the end of the season always accumulates.
And it doesn't matter what he did more than win or lose.
Every match is stress.
Persistent take-offs, transitions, all of this isn't going on for the body.
You get up physically and emotionally.
But now I have emotions, of course, to rise.
Whatever's there, I'm just happy!
By the time we finished World Cup in Beijing, do you come back often?
That's it.
Yeah, you journalists don't let me forget about it.
But in general, I believe that the bad sportman who lives in old victories is turning his successful race back and forth.
I've enjoyed winning for a couple of days, and I need to move on.
Was the preparation for this remarkable season very different from the usual?
I can't say it was something special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter competition season.
He was first trained at home in Barnaul, then at the meetings, then back home.
It's all normal.
But with the coach they put the task of trying to get to a new level that I haven't been to yet.
Almost all the winter time was spent building a base.
They ran across the crossroads, made exercises in physical training, which included both weight and weight, and sawing, and we pushed our back.
Then, when they took the barrier preparation, they did a lot of technical work.
Did they follow up on what the rivals were saying?
I'm always trying to do this, and there's no problem with the Internet.
He saw a winter European champion, and the French took the whole Peedestal in the barrier!
I've been thinking about something else. I've got to do something to break up this company.
With each start in this season, you added and added results.
Did that give you confidence?
I've got all the last seasons on an approximately the same schedule.
It's not like I ran 13.20 and then 13.50.
I always twist my shape gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was get away from 13 seconds.
All the work was directed primarily towards this outcome.
But the paradox is that you feel like you're ready for a promotion, and at the competitions you're willing to show up is not always possible.
What was that like at the Olympics in London?
I, if it's true, that semi-final race (Subenkov couldn't go to the final.
It's been really good, it could really have escaped for 13 seconds.
Even if he had repeated his best score at that point, he would have become the bronze scene of the Game.
But it didn't happen.
Remember your first world championship?
How so?
It was in Tagus.
I really wanted to go to the finals, it was a maximum program.
And it's gone straight from tomorrow, in the preliminary race.
Then he realized that breaking and breaking his head means not going anywhere.
Two years later, the World Cup in Moscow was in a better time.
I remember my feelings before the final race: I really wanted to win the gold by then!
How do you manage to keep your head down and keep your head down?
And that's the most difficult thing.
It needs to be very accurate, focused on technology to avoid breaking down barriers.
He noticed that when you're focusing on not the result, but on the process, it's so much easier.
And it's just that when you feel like you're running and everything looks like it's coming!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our deep - seated athletes have tried to move closer to the capital after their first serious successes.
Have you ever had such thoughts?
It's even better at home.
I don't know where I'm without my coach, who needs me?
Maybe it would be better to have better conditions, but I'm trying to be content with what I have.
C You've been screwing up for a long time?
For 12 years, from the time he came to the light athletics.
More precisely, I started training with his wife, who worked with the children, and then she handed me over.
I started with a sprint, then in a long, triple length.
The kid's multiple was, it's when they're shooting the ball, they're pulling out of place...
At 14, he tried to run with the barriers, and I liked it.
Since the first race, it has been possible to comply with the rules of the second adult.
That's what's left.
There's never been any fear of barriers?
Somehow it was possible to agree with them.
But there was always a lot of work to do on technology.
It's over one blow!
But there's no way out of this routine.
The technique has to be constantly turned off, so that I can wake up at night, I get up right away and run through the barriers.
All those who saw your race in Beijing claim it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
Usually I don't reassess my hurdles, and I couldn't stay here.
But we need to continue to work on efficiency - there is no limit to improvement.
Don't you worry now that winning a year before the Olympics is a heavy load?
As they say, I will try to justify my expectations.
Once he has chosen this road, he must go to the end.
My coach likes to say again: if you're not weak, no extra cargo should feel.
And I totally agree with him.
Other Kushanasville
Well, I'm not so naive as to have an amazing reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are sick, I understand. Don't feed them with bread.
Even though I wasn't blind to the flag, and that's exactly what a million times I was talking about here, and I didn't call anyone directly, I've got another job.
All my pseudofriends have gone missing in a second.
The press I'm subject to is so strong that even I, the guy who's got a pair of beads, I think the white people are engaged.
Either way, she's gone, she's gone, and you've been attacked by a mob, and you've got to push her with your fists.
But I need to know, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a doll, I'm out of the hood, I'm old, I'm scared.
The other thing is no support.
I didn't have any illusions, but now...
I've always had better self-sufficiency, so taste it.
And giving passports to people like Fred Derst or Monson can only be stupid.
I'd rather be the best journalist on the job.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashivili described the crimes in a harsh way:
What they did with the Crimean peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call annexation.
I believe that the reference to how the undersigned Crochet has tried to sign something is never included in the common picture of human habitation.
It's like coming to the neighbor and taking his place...
The Kremlin war is gone, and it's only going to end there.
I'm almost 100% confident that, like in the summer of 2008, she started off the phone with some kind of asshole out of the Kremlin.
I have a guess who this might be...
Cobzon's not so much alive.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist, so he needs to get his hands on Putin.
Is he losing his apartment?
Well, they took his memory off.
Of course, the people remembered him as an insult to their little family.
And reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirović.
Sunrise The Seventh Leads in the Rating Despite the Ninth Attempts to Light Up the Losing of Leaders at Today Show
Carl Stefanovich and Liza Wilkinson's trip to Canberra to highlight the consequences of the Liberal Party's statement on the liberation of the leader's seat failed to raise the rating today.
The 9th show was broadcast from the capital after Malcolm Ternbull, Tony Ebbot.
The competitor, Sunrise, with David Kokh and Samantha Armitage, was in London as part of the weekly international news series, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancún.
This torture seems to have had little significance for Australian television viewers, while the Sunrise audience had 397,000 viewers in the five largest cities compared to Today's audience in 339,000.
Today took a little more than its rating on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today, the breakup with Sunrise has been reduced in recent months.
In August today, there were 318,000 compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 349 000 viewers against 314,000 today.
It's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thank you for your clarification!
Today published on Monday, 14 September 2015.
An important news for the Seventh was the amazing performance of 800 Words with an ex-star series Packed to the Rafters Eric Thompson.
The new drama about the recently widowed father of the family, who decided to move to New Zealand on the coast with his two children, brought an impressive audience of 1,219 million.
Critics were wondering if Tomson could handle the popular show alone without the star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result is a loud yes.
The X Factor 7 remained in strong positions with 1,136 million viewers, easily bypassing The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000).
For the Seventh, the success and failure of Chase Australia was mixed up on the second night.
The first half (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new TV set by Andrew O'Keefi brought together 446,000 viewers.
In the second half (from 17:30 to 18:00), the figure was up to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuy (613,000).
On Monday evening, Chase Australia collected 520,000 viewers for the first half of the night, while on the second half, it was an increase of 720 000.
The Hot Seat has raised 620,000.
The fall of Chase Australia's ratings on the second night will make the Ninth quietly recognize that the Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30.
Chase Australia is a million dollar minute replacement that couldn't play McGuy's show.

Three finalists are unanimous in saying that "Holestoyak" Sam Wood is an ideal guy, but who will he choose?
The secret is open?
Lana Jewon-Fallows, Sarah McKay and Snow Markoski may have given an idea which of them won the Holocaust.
The woman with whom Sam Wood will finally stay in the Holestyaka is surrounded by a secret hanging.
And the three girls who have arrived at the final are, of course, keeping silent about who's got his last pink.
But when we met Sara McKay, Snow Markoski and Lana Javans-Fellows before the day the three girls had to stay two, they might have suddenly given a hint about the winner.
Sam Wood keeps quiet until the final, which will be Thursday.
All three women come in literate mood, explaining why Wood was the ideal man, referring to his sense of humor, purpose, family values, a sense of unhappiness as each of them would be happy to be his companion.
However, with their answers to the question "If not for you, who should get the last rose of Wood?", they could hardly tell which of them really won the heart of the Holostika."
Jevons-Fellows and Marcosky no doubt called McKay the ideal pair for Wood.
From the first day, good relations had developed between Sarah and Sam.
"From the moment I joined the participants, I felt the energy (Sarah) and Sam's energy and realized that they were very close to each other, and I didn't doubt it during the whole show," said Javans-Fellows.
"Sara's a very open man, easy and fun with her," added Markoski.
I've seen them together, and there's really a bond between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood will get a great couple.
McKay himself said that because of her home visits last week, she realized that Wood might be the same person.
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized it wasn't just a game -- I trusted him with all my heart," she says.
To whom should Wood be chosen, if it were not for her, she answered in confidence.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls the same thing, and Snow and Lana deserve it equally.
Show The Bachelor leaves on Wednesday at 7.30 p.m. on the Ten Canal.

Jarrid Haine had several options for starting a career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in him after his move to the United States, as were many other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open day at the end of last year.
But Hein chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsul and it seemed to be a wise solution.
Some of the coaches would leave Hein on the stand for the rest of the game behind the loss of the ball, which the former Australian Regby League played on the first return to the winning game with Minnesota with an account of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his game and gave Hayne another chance to return the panda, and also engaged him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula showed up on the right side and after the game, in a breakup.
Instead of making a difference in the presence of the new team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hein at the press conferences after the match.
The Special Rapporteur of Club 49ers Kam Inman reported that Hein also received support from the Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarred Hein lost the ball on the back of the Pant by the Minnesota Vikings team during the first quarter
At the beginning of this debut in NHL Hein and his many Australian worshipers were clearly not counted.
It was clear how Haine was complaining about leaving the field after losing the ball, and later he told the leading show "Hemish and Andy" at the Australian radio 2DayFM 104.1, which could not imagine a more unsuccessful start for a career in NFL.
"That's what happens, you're just thinking about the next game and everything," Hen said.
Hein compared his career to his debut in the Origins series in 2007, when a ball break in his county led to the attempt by Queensland.
Finally, this experience proved very useful for the 27-year-old.
Hen took a picture of the Australian flag and fans after the game and took a picture in Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Hodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested for the use of weapons at the Siberian airport.

Migrants are throwing away police stones and trying to remove a border fence.
The site of the clashes is strengthened, police take action in response to the aggressive actions of migrants and their attempts to break the border.
According to the Agency France-Presse, refugees were able to cross the police border, after which tens of migrants fled the territory of Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Hungarian-Serbian border on buses heading to Belgrade and the border with Croatia, Bibi-si reports.
The authorities of the countries have allowed migrants to come to Croatian territory and to ensure that they are transported from there to the country they need.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, Hungary ' s Parliament stepped up its legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments involve the involvement of the army in the protection of State borders, the criminal prosecution of those who illegally cross the border, as well as the accelerated procedure for dealing with asylum applications.
The Hungarian court has already recognized one migrant guilty of an illegal crossing of the Hungarian-Serbian border and will therefore be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary for one year.
The Hungarian Parliament also intends to consider soon the transfer of functions to the Hungarian armed forces to protect the border of the country.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began to build an armchair of 175 km long on the border with Serbia to stop the flow of migrants and refugees to the country.
The Russian acknowledged the greatest in the history of cyberattack.
Russian cyberattack Russian Vladimir Drinkman admitted to stealing more than 160 million credit cards, reports Reuters.
During the trial in the state court of New Jersey, Drunkman was admitted in a speech to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian spoke with three Russian citizens and a Ukrainian citizen accused of cyber attacks on 15 companies.
The total damage suffered by the accused was estimated at $300 million.
"Responsors like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to break down our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security," said U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman.
Drunkman is threatened with 30 years of imprisonment and a fine of $1 million.
The court shall take into account the confession of the Russian and may reduce the time limit.
Drunkman's sentence will be pronounced on 15 January.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
Then another suspect Dmitry Smilian was arrested.
His last guilt in the crimes he committed is denied.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk with the support of Russia's Bashar Assad regime.
During a telephone conversation with the head of Russian MIDI, Sergeim Lavrov, U.S. Secretary-General John Kerry, warned that the Russian support of Syrian President Bashar Asada was exacerbating the conflict in the country.
“Secretary Kerry has come to understand that the support of Russian President Assad is likely to exacerbate and exacerbate the conflict, as well as undermine our common objective of combating extremism if we do not focus on finding solutions to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition,” says a communication published on the United States Government website.
Kerry reaffirmed the United States' commitment to combating the Islamic State group (which was banned by the Supreme Court in Russia) in a coalition of more than 60 States.
According to the Secretary-General, Assad "will never be a reliable member" of the coalition.
Kerry also stressed during the telephone conversation that the conflict in Syria could only be resolved by political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of the support of the Assad regime.
Earlier, the White House Press Secretary, Joshua Ernest, threatened Russia with isolation if he did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest offered to join the international coalition, which is conducting an anti-terrorism operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media have often reported the presence of Russian soldiers in the territory of Syria.
On what did the head of the Russian MID Sergey Lavrov say that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and have helped the Syrians to seize the technique to apply it against Islamists.
Four were killed when the police fired a rifle gun at the protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when the police launched a shooting of resinive bullets in a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution of the country, as the official representative said on Wednesday.
Violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandei district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital of the country.
The former Plastad Dakal, head of the district police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered in one of the police offices, some had thrown stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal reported that the police had used liquefied gas and then shot in the air before the debris was released.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not clear why resin bullets, which are known to be killed but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such a high mortality.
This conflict was the last few weeks of fierce protests in the southern, even Nepal, where the Madesi people ' s representatives said that the new provinces formed under the new constitution would reduce their political influence.
Protests also took place in western Nepal, among the people of the Taru people who wanted to have their status.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, were killed in brutal clashes, beginning with 10
August, when the four major political parties signed a country-specific agreement in the province, which had become a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which had been centrally managed for several centuries.
The new constitution has been in operation since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process since the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
The legislators voted in favour of the articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week and the officials said that the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Saiansk plans to set up an enterprise in 900 jobs.
Saiansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk area.
It was built in the 1970s as a center of the chemical industry, with developed infrastructure requiring systemic support.
A year ago, Saiansk led the new mayor, Oleg Borovsky.
On the outcome of the first year of work, he described new projects and prospects to the Correspondent of the Area.
Oleg Valerjevich, why did you start working as a mayor?
First of all, I have been familiar with the results of audits of financial and management activities, and I have initiated an independent audit on local budget expenditures.
A municipal property audit was then conducted.
One of the first practical steps has been to reduce document turnover to five days.
Previously, the papers by the authorities were able to walk for months.
Activities have been developed to improve the income base and optimize expenditures.
In November last year, a Government visit was held in Saiyan, which dealt with the socio-economic development of the Territory.
There was no project-calculation (PSD) documentation in the city for any object.
Without that, Sayansk could not participate in federal programmes.
We started with the preparation of PSDs on the road, the children's garden, the north sewer and the water.
There are now road work on two sites.
How does the city comply with the orders of the President of the RF on the construction of children's gardens?
In July of this year, 105 children were born in Saianska.
This positive population in the city has not been seen in the past 27 years.
So the issue of the security of places in kindergartens is one of the most relevant today.
Since 1 September, detsad No. 10 has been refurbished for 320 seats.
The estimated cost of repair is 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such funds before.
Last year, after repair, a children ' s garden No. 23 was opened, which now has 200 children.
The refurbishment was made under the conditions of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, worth more than 67 million rubles.
Through the efforts of the administration and assistance of the regional Government, funds for the purchase of furniture and equipment have also been sought, and the National Initiatives programme has been supported.
There are plans to start building a new childhood now in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the number of children between half and three years of age.
We don't have a three-to-seven-year-old order.
Are investors interested in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that the construction of the city must be done, above all, by the Saiyan companies, that they need to be done.
In October, a 60-quarter house for orphans in the Leningradian microregion is being opened.
With regard to construction, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangaria, which has entered the class housing programme.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 blocks will begin soon.
We have declared everything about the construction of 10,000 sq.m. of homes that wish to participate in the programme very much.
One of the conditions is that the housing must not be worth 30,000 rubles per square metre, this value includes the "key" section.
If we deal with the required levels, we will continue to participate in the programme.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
In its time, the Saian swine complex was built in the territory, which was sold at no cost in 2004.
We're working with the defense prosecutor's office on this deal.
The more land under the facility, the more federal property.
Work is under way with Moscow, the issue of transfer of 88 g to the district property, from the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor willing to invest in reconstruction and launch a 1.5 billion rubles project.
We'll have 900 jobs with a pig complex gun, which will be a big support for the city.
Will the institution of social partnership develop in Saianska?
We have some 140 social and economic partnership treaties.
Many projects have been implemented through the active social position of business representatives.
Eligible support is provided by companies such as the East-Center, the New-Ziminian TEC, the Saian Broiler, the IMF, and the management of these companies.
Directly to the Day of the City of OOO "Syansky Broyler" gave the city a children's town, East-Centr's firm has repaired a horse court where specialists are dealing with children's ill-therapy, spending more than 1 million rubles on this.
Through the sponsorship, the territory of the city of ZAGSA has been well-established.
The sponsors helped to highlight the City Day beautifully.
As in old times, there has been a parade with the participation of urban communities and organizations.
The city’s metaphor, the book of Chinese poets, was published.
Jewelry medals have been given to the pioneers and people who have contributed a great deal of work to the development of Saiyan.
Mecenats also participate in the City Welfare Fund.
The first step was the acquisition of tools for young talented musicians.
Over nine months of more than 800 thousand rubles are aimed at supporting talented children, at helping children in need of expensive treatment, and at supporting children from disadvantaged families.
How are the personnel problems in the social sphere resolved in the Saiyan?
There's not enough doctors and art teacher in town.
The provision of housing professionals is of great importance in addressing the staff issue.
Last year, we had five doctor’s rooms, and four teachers were assigned to the office.
We have a housing program with the possibility of privatizing it in five years.
Plans are to replan a building that will build eight more apartments for educators.
Teachers and doctors are also involved in the program “Gilve for the Russian Family”.
In view of this, the building of a house for budgetary workers.
The main thing is that there is a working team in town that I can handle the most complex issues.
It is important to make correct conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is great.
The Duma introduced a draft law on the indexation of savings in the light of price increases.
The Government introduced a bill to index social pensions annually from 1 February to take account of price increases.
The author of the document, a Member of the “Justice Russia” Alexander Lomakin-Romanian, also proposes to carry out an additional pension index on 1 April if the rate of increase in the living minimum exceeds the rate of increase in prices for goods and services.
The pension index under current legislation is carried out annually as of 1 April, taking into account the rate of increase in the minimum pensioner ' s living rate in RF for the previous year.
The draft law introduced in the lower court provides for the introduction of a social pension index, taking into account the rate of growth in consumer prices.
The first index is carried out on 1 February and the second is carried out on 1 April.
The head of the OSCE said that Mogerini was not allowed to impose sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs of the Federica Mogerina, the speaker of the OSCE P.A., Ilck Canerwa, stated that sanctions against legislators participating in the assembly were not allowed.
This was reported to journalists by a member of the Russian delegation at the October session of the OSCE PA in Ulan-Batore Nikolai Kovalev.
Signatories from European Parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, have been collected in support of the position of the Canerwa.
"There's already been enough strong support," Kovalev said.
He had previously stated that the head of the OSCE PAC was intent on gathering signatures of Members who indicated that sanctions against parliamentarians were not allowed.
In particular, he noted Kovalev, Canerva promised to raise the issue to the level of the Euro-Union guidelines and to “send the relevant petition”.
NHC reports that the probability of a cyclone south of the Green Measles is 60 per cent
The broad low-pressure front of some 350 miles (560 km) south of the Cape Verde Islands is likely to turn into a tropical cycle for about 60 per cent over the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Centre reported on Tuesday.
Another clearly defined low-pressure area between the Green Mesa and the Small Antyl Islands also has a 60 per cent probability of tropic cyclone forming within the next two days, synoptics from Miami reported.
Google launches a double-off campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the launch of a double-off campaign to collect $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping European countries to fill out refugees fleeing the war-torn and ravaged countries.
Google used a characterless personal approach, announcing a donation campaign in its blog.
Instead of making a statement by one of the managers, Google's employee Rita Masud, who was fleeing Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We went on suspicious trains and buses, endured hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has intensified, many people, such as my family, desperately need help.
Contributions will be made to four non-commercial organizations dealing with refugees and migrants: " Doctors without borders", International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would double the first $5.5 million of donations until the amount on google.com/refugeerelief reached $11 million.
Europe is facing the strongest crisis with refugees since World War II, caused by most of the four-year civil war in Syria, resulting in more than 4 million people moving this year.
Many are also fleeing from the wars of Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics with low obesity may help with obesity surgery
The beneficial effect of post-ingestion surgery in people with low ingestion with type 2 diabetes may be at least five years, according to the new study.
However, it is still early to argue that small-fat diabetes lives longer after obesity than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"The mortality statistics are not available immediately," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity surgery, who wrote about a new study in the column of editor JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the ability to consume food.
For several years, bariatric surgery has proven its effectiveness for type 2 diabetes treatment, but major studies have been conducted among people with morbid obesity with body mass index (IMT) 35 or above.
IMT, the measure of weight relative to growth, is considered normal with a value of 18.5 to 24.9.
IMT 25 or above says that humans have overweight and people with IMT over 30 are considered obese.
You can count your IM here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers from the Taiwanese Min-Sheng General Hospital have used the data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, choking the stomach and gastrointestinal tract, with type 2 diabetes treatment in people with low obesity.
The mean importance of ICT for those undergoing surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, ICT remains at approximately 29 levels for those who have received non-surgical treatment from diabetes.
Of those who carried the surgery, 36% were completely cured and 28% were cured.
In the treatment group, only 1 per cent of patients with diabetes were completely cured, and only about 2 per cent were partially treated.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and “bad LPNP” cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group”, according to the authors.
Researchers also monitored levels of haemoglobin of A1s in the blood, which reflect levels of blood sugar in the blood.
Gemoglobin A1c is better kept below 7%, according to researchers.
Following surgery, the mean haemoglobin A1c decreased from approximately 9 per cent to approximately 6 per cent.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, approximately 8 per cent.
But better glycaemic control rates, reflected by good levels of haemoglobin A1c, did not reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to Dr. Chi Cheng Su and fellow researchers.
The study group also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, compared to a group with manual gastrectomy, the cumulation group lost more weight (18.7 kg vs 14.2 kg), achieved a greater reduction in IMT (7.4 vs 5.1) and haemoglobin A1s (3.1% vs 2.1 per cent) and was closer to full remission of diabetes (46.9 per cent vs 16.7%).
While the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of the surgical method in part of the life after five years, there are confirmations from a study of excess body mass in Sweden that surgical treatment actually leads to an increase in life expectancy, according to Blackstone from the College of Medicine in Phoenix, Arizona University.
According to the Swedish study, the probability of dying during the 15-year period was about 29 per cent lower than that of a group with more traditional methods.
Despite the fact that the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this encouraged people with ICT below 35 interested in such a procedure.
“The report is very important here, as it states that such surgical intervention is safe in a low-IMT group where there is no increased risk of death or early disease,” she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to be serious about weight as soon as the patient reaches the range between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to make people take this seriously," she said.
It seems to me that as soon as they accumulate the genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to turn it back.
The robbers were taken out of the shed and 9 million rubles.
There were 9 million rubles and three women’s shoes on the inhabitants of the Moscow sub - house.
This is reported by Interfax with reference to the IMF press service.
An incident happened on Tuesday morning.
Two strangers entered the house on the street of Goriko, tied up their 20-year-old son by the housekeeper and, threatening both knives, kidnapped 9 million rubles and three rubles.
According to the preliminary data, the damage amounted to 9 million 265,000 rubles, a criminal case under the heading “Razboi”.

Only 23 peterburg hotels have the right to accommodate tourists who will come to the World Football Championship in 2018.
Other hotels are not in a hurry to obtain the permit.
In the opinion of the experts, this is a very alarming sign.
Before the world championship, the authorities will have to consider how to dissipate all the guests of the city.
The Rosbalta interviewers believe that the value of renting residential apartments will grow by 10-30 per cent and that after the tournament, there will have to be a refund.
The World Football Championship has led the authorities to draw attention to the state of Russian hotels.
Under the law written specifically under precedence, each Petersburg hotel must undergo a classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the stated number of stars and the level of service.
Now it is clear that not everyone will be able to do this: the vets are so afraid of checking that often they do not even send documents to the Federal Antitrust Service in Petersburg.
As told by UFAS head Vadim Vladimirov, the department has examined 138 hotels and is now planning 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to anti-immony users.
There is evidence that the management of three dozen companies has deceived a citizen, placing some number of stars in the advertisement, Vladimirov noted.
The problem is that now, literally, every number can't be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that all peterburg hotels will be occupied during the football championship.
Now in the city, tourists can count on 30.5,000 numbers.
According to Small, 17 five-star hotels in Petersburg, 51 four-star hotel, 100-two-and-three-star, 550-one-star.
According to the first Deputy Committee on Tourism Development, only 23 hotels have been classified at the moment, so much has been verified by the company accredited in Petersburg.
And here's if any hotel has ordered such a procedure for regional enterprises that are not known to the Small to Surprising Circumstances.
That is, there may be more classification, but no one knows about it.
"The last half-years of hotels have not tried very hard to be classified," acknowledged the director of the North-West Office of the Russian Union's Ekaterin Shadsky Tournament.
This is due to a high season during which hotels make the most money and do not want to deal with other cases.
Another reason is that there were no budgets for verifications, and the procedure could cover the hotel depending on the status of between 30 and 100 thousand rubles and more.
But in recent times, hotel managers have stepped up and started applying for classification, Shadsky said.
Hotels are expected to succeed by 1 July 2016, otherwise they will not only pay the fine, but will not yet be allowed to work at the World Cup.
It is already known that, depending on the star, a fixed hotel number fee will be drawn up during the tournament.
The formulas for which value will be calculated will be published next year.
This was done so as not to allow prices to rise by 200-300 per cent, as is the case, for example, during the Petersburg Economic Forum.
We need to have a conscience and not allow an increase of two or three times, but we also need to let the hotels earn.
"I think there will be an increase of up to 50%," explained the President of the Russian Hosting Association of Gennadia Lamshin.
In turn, Wadim Vladimirov is not convinced that the price fixing corresponds to the market economy.
I don't know how much this goes into economic theory, but I hope this measure is justified.
"It's a better safe trip," he said.
It's not clear what's going to happen with popular cheap hotels.
Members of the Gosmund have introduced a bill that states that hotels should be banned in homes.
We hope that this law will not be adopted or will not apply to Petersburg.
"We're going to stand up to the view that the hotels must be kept," says Nana Guachia.
However, she said that hotel owners should in any case be prepared to strengthen the Housing Code.
If Gosmunda still approves the bill, there will be about 80 per cent of the hotels in Petersburg, and there are now 1.5 thousand rooms.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurants and Hotels in North-West Leonid Garbara, two and three star hotels are missing in Petersburg, which are once cut off by footballers, as there is a gap between hotels with four and five stars.
This is similar to the situation in which “75 thousand orphans are seated at the 80-year-old.”
This can be corrected as soon as possible by means of mini-hotels.
Their possible ban is considered "idiotism," "I think it's strange that some people can live in apartments, and here's why they can't."
If the hotel is used as a residence, I agree it's wrong.
But if the hotel where the guests arrive for a short time, why not?
The mini-hospitals are at risk of losing the world's football champions and because of their insatiability.
Hundreds of small hotels simply fail to pass the classification, and he is left alone.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be ordered.
“The companies that can carry out this procedure are not so many, so they will reject less paid orders from the mini-hotel and choose those who travel,” noted Gennadia Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograde, the results of the checks that have been carried out at this time are much higher than those of Petroburg.
The cause of the Petersburg delay is related, including permanent transfers to the Government ' s tourist block, which does not contribute to a coherent work.
According to experts, if peterburg hotels are not enough, then it is likely that we will have to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
For example, the 300th anniversary of Petersburg in the city can mobilize a river fleet, which means that guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many sufferers will be prepared to arrive on the trucks at night.
"The main thing is not to set up so many hotels so that they can be deserted," is certain Gennadia Lamshin.
It will also be very popular during the football championship to take advantage of residential housing.
The city's most likely to create a reserve of accomodation.
Rent rates will grow by 10-30 per cent.
"From the obvious - the first one will go home near the stadium," said a rental specialist of the Agency for Development and Real Estate Research, Larissa Bragin.
The rental price may not return to the former level after the championship, especially in sleeping areas.
This will also contribute to the construction of new transport connections on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
There is no need to forget about the human qualities of citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is convinced that Petersburg has always been a hospitable city where people not only point to the road but can still take a mini-walk.
There are also complications.
In 1970 my father met a family from Murmansk, a father, a mother, and two children in the court.
They found it difficult to sleep in the living room at night.
"And my dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," recalled the interviewer.
The truth is, he added that such a fate in the city’s inhabitants has now not been left to call home the consequences and the horrors.
But in 2018, after the failure of the House, would the mistake of the victims and the governments have to be remembered?
Girinov "slid" Amour area.
He was amazed to see the Girinovski clown in Gosmund today.
He did such things when our generation had just learned to trade newspapers, and they are still in beautiful shape.
The theme of the speech, for example, is “the LDPR protest against the outcome of the Amurian elections”.
Protocols do not shake -- for nothing; other protocols, other than those signed by the electors, do not appear to have LDPR.
He raises up the second position of Ivan Abram. He calls out, "This is the winner of the election."
And there's nothing that goes on to Rodney, and then, after the break with the president, he's bringing a group out of the meeting room, literally saying, "You're all with the fronts of your jugs and holes."
The press, of course, focuses not on Abramov, but on the scandal and demarcation of the factions as a result of this scandal and insults.
The real Wolfovic had a beautiful and elegant smelting of the Amour region along with Abraham.
For the whole country, this is a regular outcome of the Girinov style of the Podonka, but it is not a protest of the political party against the results of the specific elections.
And the fact that the fact that the party and Facebook of Ivan Abramov have been officially scandalized is not recognized, but the leader of the topic is clearly coming down.
It provides the dead in Amur to bury their dead people themselves, and it itself preaches against the "One Russia" in general and in nothing worthy of the Family.
It's a good decision not to lose a person, not to go into a show-off scandal.
Another case that is now in a strange situation is Abraham himself.
In addition to his leadership, he didn't expect anything, there were no alternative protocols in his hands.
He was not the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but, on the other, for the close circle, he was a formal cause and an insult to the respected champion, and, in fact, he was a homicidal victim to the ER and the NF.
And here, of course, he has to think seriously about what to do.
Because from the main election beneficiary, region 2 policy and candidate number 1 to the only district-wide one-member district, he could become a successful party leader and superintendent for the same UNF and foreign party leader.
That's right, it wouldn't be Girinov, it should be thought of and respected.
The trampo is still growing and growing.
There was news that LDPR would return to the hall during the next plenary session.
That's the bathroom just dropped out of nothing.
Only, Abram's theme is buried.
It's really beautiful.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for the cessation of violence in refugee countries.
Dalai Lama referred to the ongoing refugee crisis in her speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Conciliation Centre in Oxford on Ethics at the beginning of her 10-day visit to Britain.
He stated that in the current circumstances, the interests of humanity should be higher than those of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, although this is a startling one, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said.
Although the Dalai Lama was aware of the actions taken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"The concern of thousands of refugees is wonderful, but at the same time you should also think about long-term solutions to bring about this world and the present development, mainly through education, in these Muslim countries," he stressed.
In the end, we must think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Referring to violence, Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George Bush following terrorist acts 9/11, stating that the United States had launched a series of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the problem could be solved through non-violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he used force, and that led to unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the number of children swallowed by hand disinfectants over the past 4 years
Toxicological centres in the United States reported an almost 400 per cent increase, beginning in 2010, the number of children under 12 years of age who have swallowed a high alcohol-related disinfectant, as reported by the toxicological centre of the state of Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Toxic Center of the State of Georgia, cases of childhood births up to 12 years of fluid for hand disinfection reported at the Toxic Centers increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
“Children are more likely to contact these substances, and unfortunately some of them are sent to the emergency room,” said Lopes CNN.
He said that some children drink degenerative fluids especially, and some do so to impress their friends or to argue for social networks.
Youtube videos show that adolescents drink degenerative fluid as cheap drinks.
Adolescents are reported to have mixed disinfectant fluids with alcohol-containing fluids to cool their mouth to obtain stronger drinks.
Children of a younger age may be attracted to the pleasant smells of disinfectant fluid.
"The baby doesn't think it can hurt him," Lopes reported.
Many of the most attractive (defective liquids for hand) are those that are flavoured.
There are disinfectant fluids for hands with scented tubers, vineyards, and oranges that are very attractive to children.
The disinfectant fluid for the hands contains somewhere from 45 per cent to 95 per cent of alcohol.
Small children, in particular, may have a number of problems with alcohol poisoning.
"It's a high-concentration alcohol," said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Steven Thornton, chief doctor of the toxicology center at the University of Kansas.
You wouldn't just leave a bottle of whiskey, but people would keep in mind these disinfectants for the hands, and if the kids get to them, it's a quick way to use a lot of alcohol.
Nidja Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently swallowed a disinfectant for hand-to-hands with a club aroma in about four compartments, was treated in the emergency room.
The level of alcohol in her blood was 179, twice as high as that of an adult who was considered under the law to be in a state of alcoholism, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, a doctor of emergency care who treated her at the Guinnet Medical Center near Atlanta.
Najija had spoken and could not walk when she was delivered to the emergency room.
Doctors watched her all night at a separate clinic to avoid losing any signs of brain injury, as the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, said Ritchie.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortaria Scott, the mother of Niji.
This could have been quite fatal for my child.
Lopes recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic substances or disinfectants, as well as remove disinfectants from the children ' s reach area.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants link to death.
Two women from Ontario died in 2013 after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol as a death agent rather than an ethyl alcohol, which was identified as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-class students in the north of New York agreed to poison their “reversible” teacher by “dissemination of antibacterials in the classroom”, according to the police report.
The teacher had a strong allergy to hand disinfectants, and she prohibited them from keeping them in her class.
The police believe that the plan was “empty talk” and addressed issues of discipline to the school district.
As the oldest children’s library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the chimney at the entrance to the end of the children's library, the N.K. Krupsky is chewing gum.
The kids who come after the books are trying to feed her with confetti.
Several generations have gone to this library for 95 years.
The very first readers of the 20th century established the loud readings here, put on the Mayakovski verses, conducted the literary Victorians, and were rewrote with Lenin’s wife.
The census continued for four years, and as reported in 1939 by the newspaper Yun Stalintz, with every day "a friendship between the Hope of Constantine Kruppsky and the friends of the Children's Library of Barnaul" became ever stronger.
Hope Constantinople even sent her childish photograph to distant Barnaul friends.
And when the barnacles asked if Hope Constantinov would object to having her name given to the library, she wrote no, no, no.
The writings are long gone into the museum, and the grandchildren and lawyers of the first readers have to explain the hard - core profile that the library is decorated with.
In the years that followed, people often called, and they were upset: Why is the children’s library not renamed?
Let there be a library of the name of any good child writer without a political attraction!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything.
"Krupski" is, please, the most famous and popular library in Barnaul, as a "laundry" in Moscow.
In the library lobby, a yellow - brick road.
"The Wizard of the Deadly City" is the favorite theme of the artist Oly Moskovka.
In the past, Ola was a manager in a legal company, worked at eight, left at five, and was distinguished from all other managers only by love of painting.
And then she found an online announcement, "I need an illustrator for a book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and she was called My Cancer Mommy.
The oil was making an illustration, and she thought that life could end at any time, and there would be no miracles in it unless you created them yourself.
Now she works in the library, illustrated the children’s books of writers around the world, and produced stories herself.
Traditionally, children are losing interest in the book that they are increasingly living in some virtual space...
But we have kids reading, and their parents understand the importance of reading, says Tatyana Kushvid, director of the Russian Planet.
In recent years, we've even had such a time of confidence that the children's library is needed, and she's gonna live -- kids are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
In the library lobby, a large exhibition is held with an updated photo exhibition.
New photos of readers who go to the library of the whole family — Mom, Dad, and children — are posted.
The library is happy that the popes have become more and more present with the children.
If a child is two years old, he or she needs books more difficult when he or she is older.
But now there is a law that prohibits eight-year-olds from issuing 12+ books.
To get such a book, a child must bring with him or her parents -- they come back, then they come back, and gradually "Kruski" becomes something like a family club for them.
There are treasures in the library - the pre-revolutionary collection of Yates and eras, take the Queen in the annex to the magazine "Niva", the "Murzylki" for 1936.
For now we are not only the conceptual space of the temple book, we are now open to move, we are trying to become a special place: not a house, not a work, not a school, - explains Tatian Kushvid.
We can come here to read, play, draw together.
We've made a play area for the kid. The kid just comes to play, and the arm still pulls to the book!
Some of our readers are wearing their parents, and they stand with their feet and do not want to leave.
Moms often come with wheels, and we're glad they put the library first among all the other places where they have to come with the kids.
Tatiana Kushvid says that modern children like us once loved classical children's literature:
"The extradition case is now developing, and much attention is paid to the authors who are the linkages between generations."
And if you're talking about little kids, it's important for them to be some kind of hero who travels from one book to another.
Children don't like to break up with their heroes.
The Library regularly issues booklets for parents, telling them what is happening in modern children’s literature, which books are to be kept in mind and why.
The booklets are so interesting and interesting that adults are interested, but this library is not for them at all.
It is forbidden to issue books outside the reading room to adults.
This magical privilege has only children.
...In the library's most distant room there's a square corner with an old wooden staircase in the basement, in the library.
Steps are going to slip under your steps, it's a very old time machine.
You meet your childhood book like an old friend: Hi, it's good that you and I don't change.
Ellie's just as happy as walking along the road that's driven by a yellow torch, Tol Rizicov's strip of magic, and Malchis Kibalchish didn't say that to the bloody Burgundy of the Military Secret, that's what he's saying.
Such books as passwords can be found anywhere in them.
There are books in the warehouse and these are rare - for example, the pre-revolutionary collection of eggs and eras.
Or bring the Queen in a famous annex to the magazine "News."
Or a "Murzylk" booster for 1936.
In time, the pages grew old and were decorated in a tea color.
These publications are no longer published to readers.
It's the sum of our future collection, and I'm all dreaming about going to retirement and doing rare children's books.
But the kids don't act like that, and the beauty in the old books isn't very bright, and the themes... you open the first page, and there's Lenin, the party, the comsomol.
Now it looks like, why did we all write this "Pioneering Truth?"
But it was still interesting, he said, "The Russian Planet" by Galina Ilasov, who was taking care of the library.
The Murzilk pages have faded from time to time.
Galina Vasilievna has led the bookstore all her life.
She knows the color of Buratino’s cocoons, how in the academic year Harry Potter became the captain of Griffindor’s team at the Quaddichure Championship, where Carlson uses a motorbike driver, and who works for Alice Selesney’s father.
The librarians pay little for their work, and everyone who can live without these books is quick to find another profession.
Only the most convinced are educators, educators, ministers of book worship.
They can be seen even in a smile - it is considered a professional drawing of a children's library.
If he smiled at you at the first minute of the conversation, he was a professional.
I like children's books as much as I like the library to be fair and beautiful, and I still love to read them, says Galina Vasilievna.
I read everything: military, historical behavior, stories, fantasy.
I'm reading modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think my childhood was different.
The books were the most interesting and fascinating thing that ever happened to me.
And since I had foolishly loved them, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be, despite the riders.
And I'm glad our ex-readers bring children and grandchildren...
Listener: There's no difference in Celtic.
Griffiths rejected the talk of the Celtic disagreements after Dale admitted that Hupps was in a bad position, but he'd fix it.
Harts will protest against the Scottish Football Association's claim to Nelson, and Worberton is afraid of signing contracts in January that might violate the team's unity.
"Dons" increased the advantage before "Seltic" to five points
The Adam Runi Penalties in the first time gave Aberdina a little advantage over Hamilton in Pittother, allowing Dons to get away from Celtic for five points.
Griffiths objected to the dispute
This led to a hearing of disputes in Celtic, which were cut off by Griffiths, claiming that he and his teammates were not suffering from any increased criticism prepared to meet with the Dutch League leaders.
I don't think we're tense, I think players are looking for him.
The Dutch are bored because the Scottish are not fighting for the title - de Bur
Former Rangers' semi-protector and former Dutch collector Ronald de Bur said that Dutch footballers lost interest in Seltique because he did not compete for the Rangers' title.
De Bur, currently a representative of Ayaxa, said: "In the Netherlands the most attractive moments of Celtic games are no longer shown, and why?"
It's because there's no Rangers.
People here are not just talking about the Rangers return.
They're talking about the old company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
In the Old Company games, there is a lot of tension, and not only do people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," said Dale.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Seltic was in trouble, but the Norwegian coach swore to change everything.
As a result of the defeat of Malmé and as a result, the League of Champions soon followed the 10 Aberdina footballers, who are now on top of the table when they leave at five points.
But Dale said, "The Celtics have had bad times before, and we'll go out again."
Now we want to get out of this as quickly as possible.
I understand it's very boring, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
And so do we, but we need to keep going.
And we really really need Seltika's support, because it's getting much better.
Stay together now so important.
Warberton is looking forward to January transfers
Despite the views that had appeared just a few weeks ago that he had identified some of the objectives of January transfers, the Ranger boss, Mark Worberton, was unfaithful to the January campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy the team.
The former attacker of Brentford said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players who come in in the summer, you have a period before the season begins to adapt, which you have seen in our own team in the season.
The team is working really well.
Sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary toys to what you really need.
Mitch, who is interested in Celtic, has decided to finish his career.
The attacker "Suncy" Mitch, linked to "Seltic" during the transfer window, insisted that he could leave football after his contract with "Lebedes" ended.
The 29-year-old play was in trouble with the boxing for two years, and he couldn't leave Wales this summer.
The Harts are going to oppose the SFA on Nelson's statements.
"Harts" said with account 2:1, when they removed Patterson, and started playing 3:2, but the red card of the protector was cancelled later; it was the third red card of Colum, cancelled in eight months.
Nelson doesn't give up his words saying, "I didn't question ethics, I didn't comment on the game."
Griffiths swore to avoid Tinkasl
The direct play by the Hibernian team was given an excuse after he admitted that he sang a song with insulting words about the former Harts of Rudy Scacell.
The incident occurred in a pub in Roseburn area in Edinburgh before the beginning of the Edinburgh Derby in Tinakasle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was a fireman," said the attacker, adding, "I can say with confidence that I wasn't going back to Tinkasl if he wasn't playing for Celtic."
Donnelly: Tannadis Board of Directors "Dandi United"
Simon Donnelly argues that the Dandi United Board of Directors is still confident that the management team will change the situation for the better, but it is agreed that the deterioration of the situation in the field must end.
I think Steven Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the guys out again," said Donelli.
Makinnes is glad he won the "unprecedented" at Hamilton.
Derek McKinness acknowledged that his Aberdin team had to fight against Hamilton Assisi desperately to win the seventh victory in the lead of the League, which put them at five points above Celtic, on top of the tournament table, thanks to the Adam Runi Penalties in the first time.
McInness said, "There's no team here that would win anything -- a doll or a league champion who didn't win a meeting like that."
There is no change in the unemployment rate among the Scottish people, while in the United Kingdom it is growing in general
The unemployment rate in Scotland remained at 164,000 for the period from May to July, while the total number of unemployed in the United Kingdom increased from 10,000 to 1.82 million for the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was higher in the United Kingdom by 5.5 per cent, as shown by the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with the number now being 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland decreased by a quarter to 74.0 per cent, above the average of 73.5 per cent for the United Kingdom.
The Minister for Scotland David Mandall, commenting on the latest figures, noted: “The long-term Government plan has laid the foundations for strengthening the economy”.
Almost a year has passed since Scotland made the historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the situation in Scotland ' s labour market as employment increases and unemployment decreases.
Why am I a witness of the punishment in Oklahoma?
Today, by turning away from legal interference at a later stage, I will see the punishment of man.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll be sitting on a visional gallery of the death row in Oklahoma State when Richard Glossip will be punished with a lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses of his death.
For the first time this request was made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew near, I became afraid.
So why would you do that?
I agreed, because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed history of the death penalty.
That would offer a unique resource.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend American executions, and since those who want more than places, the results of the Dark Lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press seats was reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever's chosen will watch it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I'll be sitting with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and we've had our own relationship with him after a few months of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed to take the block and the handle to record what I see.
I have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of acting impartially on Twitter.
It's a lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he likes it, he gets access.
I begged her.
She admitted that she could “say better” herself, but still felt that I was wrong about what I was doing.
Richard Glossip didn't agree with any of what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it, even if he said it.
I told him he could get me out of his witness list at any time.
But he wants the journalist of the international publication to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that the transparency will help to reverse the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, a Haffington Post reporter, will be with me.
If you want to know more about it, listen to the podcasts I wrote.
I won't be able to go into detail again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is not guilty.
His actions after Barry van Treize's murder make him guilty of a crime.
But I believe there's a great chance that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure the evidence for the death sentence was not enough.
I think his punishment is wrong.
And I'm going to watch him die.
I can't claim to be completely objective.
There will be other reporters who can be contacted.
From me, you'll know what it's like to see a man I like die without need.
The man who was prosecuted was ordered to leave the Canning River.
Constable from the town of Canning Weil was able to arrange for a man to leave the Canning River and remain dry.
The resident of Perta was going to leave the police, but he couldn't afford to stop in the dirty water at the mall in a few metres from the police officer trying to "feel easy to get him out of the beach".
The Canning Weil police were called on Tuesday on the grounds of illegal entry into another territory in Buckingham.
When the police noticed the suspect, he tried to get away from them by moving to Canning.
But he didn't go far.
"He stood in the water and said, "I'm not going out, come on, catch me," said Major Sergeant Chandel Kasldain.
Constable Laclano Perhavec didn't really want to wet the shape, so he used a safer reception -- "debate with a good cop."
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Casldain.
That's what Ben Casino's football champion remembered.
In 2006, Kazins went to Cuba to avoid meetings with a police patrol to check on alcohol and tried to cross Suon.
His efforts were futile, but the locals were moved to invent the funny "Ben Casino Biathlon".
Peter Mudi accuses Stuarts of trying to spy and threatens to leave the horse sport
Peter Mudi accused Stuarts Racing Victoria of trying to put a spy in his stable last year and threatened to leave the horse sport immediately.
His goal was to become the studios and staff of the Racing Victoria Ethics Division, whom he accused of having organized a campaign against him personally, and to withdraw from Lady Tathai ' s launch due to violations of the rules of use of drugs on the day of the launch, on Wednesday, became the last straw.
Mudi told Fairfax Media that he always applied all his efforts in jumping, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of the Kobalt Leader's test, which he could not explain.
He kept his tongue on the suspicions of espionage for half a year and did not want it to "look like a green vineyard."
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've been patient for a long time, but sometimes it's getting you out of the wheel so much that you don't hold back," Mudi said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I'm gonna have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and get some sleep.
I want to walk with a high-headed head and I want my owners to know that I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start thinking it's not like that, then I'm gonna have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Mudi had previously made a sensational statement during an interview with the racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy on his horse.
"About a year ago Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stuart lived in a room with a man I'd call if asked, and offered him a job in my stable to pass on information about what I'm doing in my stable," Mudi told Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should all make statements, as they failed to get me.
Robert Rollston, former president of RVL, David Mudi, current president of RVL, and Bernard Sandri, former CEO of RVL, have known about this all the time and know it now.
Shouldn't that make me think it's personal?
Shouldn't RVL take courage and call for a response to what's happening in this business, other than coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think it's true.
Maybe they should take my license and push me away, and I don't doubt - what I'm saying right now can make them think about it.
But I got to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
I'm really sad about this.
I will put pressure on them and will be responsible for their decision-making.
I have family support, and I can leave.
The coach's boredom only grew during a long investigation of the case with the cobalt and the leader, and the last removal of the horse from the start made him say he could "put his license on the table".
Mudi, the most famous of all that he had prepared for the invincible Black Caviar champion, called the requirements for the use of medical preparations on the day of the “silver” collision after the horse’s legs were pressed from the ground, which was a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules on jumps.
"I must bear full responsibility for this," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly forced her on her feet.
She could've had a compression last night.
She could have gotten it yesterday, as it was.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Mudi may be disqualified for three months in accordance with the rules on the use of medical medicinal products on the day of compressions, which the studios have launched.
It's anecdotes.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all know we need rules, but it's gone too far," Mudi said.
Head of the investigation and hiding from the scene of the incident in Kobarma, arrested
The police arrested a man who hit a motorcyclist in Kobrama and hid from the scene.
A motorcyclist was delivered to a helicopter at Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car at Murrey Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver had left without stopping to help the wounded motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of Natalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
It is expected that he will be charged with abandoning the scene, refusing assistance and in violation of other road traffic rules.
Motorcyclist, 40-year-old Kobrama, remains in hospital in stable condition.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellami, indicted by his rivals in the use of harsh force.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellami, called the criticism of his team's ball capture as "the opening of the agenda" by two NRL champions.
Coach Sidney Rusters Trent Robinson said the judges allowed Storm to "fight" with his team during a sudden Storm victory at the Sydney qualifying game on Friday evening.
Coach Brisbane Broncos Waynet made a clear swing at Storm after his team won a qualifying tournament at Nozern Queensland Caboys on Saturday evening, when he called this game "typical" for the Regby League and said that two of the Queensland teams were not "too successful" in the handball.
Bellami was protecting his team's ball capture and said they were just focused on "contacts", catching the ball.
Bellami added that he was convinced that his team was criticizing him by two leading coaches, since that meant that they were concerned about the possible defeat of the Storm.
"It's still floating - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about tough receptions when they beat us with a 24:2 account," Bellami said on Wednesday.
I can tell you that we haven't changed anything all year round in our systems or protection techniques, just in the last six weeks, we've been paying particular attention to contacts when you take the ball, and this has become a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years and he's obviously training a great team, so he's probably not used to playing, and it's been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how it always turns out this time of year.
Bellami challenged Bennett's idea of "impressive football", reminding his teacher that "St George-Illavar Dregons" was won by Bennett in the 2010 championship, showing "gay" football.
Wayne's talking about catching football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and see how impressive their game was," Bellami remarked.
I remember that in 2010 St. George was very critical, calling it a boring team, and Wayne said he wouldn't care.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks is impressive football, especially his young semi-protectors at their speed.
It's a football you'd like to play when you have such games.
He made this comment in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style -- not every team has two half-protectors like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried about us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they got to big games.
Bellami also noted that the Storm and Rusters game was a competition with a large number of points than the Broncos and Cabous.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen her yet, but what was the bill?
In our game he was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what, is this impressive football?
Or do you consider it an impressive breakup and unsuccessful attempt?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can meet them there.
At Storm at the end of this weekend, as they won the right to take home either North Queensland Caboys or Crown Sharks on the next Saturday evening at the preliminary final at the AAMI Park, tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
Serbian drug-indicted release of $200 000 in bet
A man who was threatened by a life sentence for an attempt to allocate 40 kg of cocaine delivered to Queensland by smuggling was released in a deposit of $200,000.
Marko Maximovic, 29 years old, is one of five people arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on the Solay yacht from South America through Vanuatu and landed in Kumer in August.
During the morning Maximovich and his associates saw him at the docks, and later he met them at Coomer Roadhouse, where the police found 40 pounds of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Although Maximovich is at risk of a life-time attempt to allocate drugs in sufficient quantity for sale, lawyer Maximovich argues that there is no evidence that the latter tried to reach the whole party, and that the man could be in coffee without any idea.
The Supreme Court judge, Peter Flenagan, doubted that Maximomich had to be released under bail.
The latter has links with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Mother and uncle Maximovich were invited to make a joint bet of $200,000 for his release.
"The testimony of both shows that the amount of $200,000 is too large a financial burden for them," observed Judge Flenagan.
But one such measure was not enough to guarantee that he would not disappear, the judge added.
Maximovich was allowed to be released under bail provided that he would deliver both his Australian and Serbian passports, be reported to the police daily and comply with the command from 6 o'clock in the evening until 6 o'clock in the morning.
Photo: "I'm proud of the collection of Greece, which has been fought until the last few seconds."
The Greek Chief Collector Fotis Kacikaris paid tribute to his team after the 1/4th Eurobasket 2015 final with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game was determined by individual mistakes.
It was a big game, quoted by AFP Kasicaris.
We prepared for a great Spanish game.
They tried to work on the defence, but the defence errors determined the outcome of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my kids.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: "I will be assigned to Coun's functions in the CSCA."
The CSCA Newsman Joel Freeland said he did not believe in the curse of the army.
The British also expressed confidence that its new club would be able to break down the negative trend and finally win the Euroliga next season.
I spoke to Coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and myself, after I joined the team, quote "R-Sport" Friland.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to switch to the central position, but at the NBA, I played more forvard.
Now we're going to have to stand up to a big central rival, but I've done this before, so I think, and I'm going to do it now.
The army last won the Euro League in 2008.
Since then, they've been going to Final Four, but they couldn't always show their best basketball.
It's like someone's got the team on the line.
In this game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's difficult, I understand all the disappointment of the club and its sufferers.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can, we have a good chance of winning the Euroliga, I really think.
I always wanted to win this title, the Moscowers have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be CSCA's year.
As far as I'm concerned, I'm not a sovereign man and I don't believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, it's possible.
I don't have any rituals in front of games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Luis Enrique: "To me, a match with "Rome" will be special."
The main coach of Barcelona, Luis Enrique, did not hide that he had returned to Rome for the 1st round of the group tournament of the League of Champions with Rome with special feelings.
According to the teacher, the visible unit of his current and former team would be far from a row for him.
Remember, Luis Enrique trained wolves in the 2011/12 season, but couldn't show up on the best side in the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome a few years later, for which I had gained some experience.
I have some very warm memories of Rome.
It's gonna be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start the League of Champions from victory.
The August meeting in Kubke Joan Hamper does not affect the action of the teams in the next match.
I'm looking forward to the "Rome" game she showed in series A against "Yventus".
It's a strong team that can press and know what to do with the ball.
Wadim Scripchenko: Krasnodar has various options for attacking."
The acting chief coach of Urala Wadim Scripchenko in the front of the 9th Prime Minister's Tour with Krasnodar noted the diversity of the attackers of the team.
According to the teacher, the "bottles" in their arsenal have several models of the game in attack.
The unit will be held on 21 September and will begin at 16.30 a.m. in Moscow.
As we play with Krasnodar, let's see, the official website of Urala brings the word Scripchenko.
We've got a week ahead of us.
This team has various options for attacking, variously carrying out its attacks, while we are not slow, so I think it will be a very interesting game.
In the foreplay of this game, given that Krasnodar is a match for the League of Europe against Dortmund, we are trying very well to prepare for victory.
Roger Canyjas: "The Astana House" can pick any one's eyes.

"Benfico" above the class, but in the home match, I think we can count on them to pick their eyes.
It's real.
But first we need to think about Galatasarae and then the Atlethico.
In the home games, we can pick the glasses for anyone.

I'm glad we didn't miss the ball and kill four.
Christian Ronald confirmed his level.
It's the best game in the world, I'll repeat it as many times as I like.

"Barcelona" is a special rival, a great team with great players, quoting the official website of UEFA De Rossi.
It's difficult to play with blue grenades, because they have not only a unique style, but also a bright personality.

Steven Hogg used the girl's phone to make pedophiles send photos
Pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to question images of violence against children.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone while she was asleep and registered on the Internet to transmit messages where he received a number of rude images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found the missing phone and found it in the sleeping hand of Hogg.
She checked it and found shocking photos, and then immediately turned to her mother for attention.
The police came and saw five images, then examined the computers found at the address, and found “relevant” requests in the search system using words to detect children’s improper images.
Hogg then said to the police that he did it because it could "draw pedophiles" and then he would "make him a cop to scare them."
The judge-in-law Elid Robertson told the sheriff's court in Danda: "He said it was a passion, he was a passion to scare people.
He recognized what he was doing on the computer, but he said it was because he wanted to become a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversation with an unknown person who had sent him images and asked him to send more photographs.
He said he was doing this to fool them.
He said he had problems with his head when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When the girl found the pictures on the phone, she called her mother and cried and cried.
She saw rude images on the phone, and at that time an eyebrow was held with the accused.
The girl was interrogated and reported that the accused used the computer and Plasterstein to talk to the girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road in Dandi, admitted guilty of charges against children's informal photographs last June 14, in violation of the conditions of 25 January of this year and did not appear before the court at the hearing on 24 March of this year.
Advocate Gregor Sim applied not to include Hogga in the list of persons who committed sexual offences, since it can be proved that there was no "significant sexual element" in this crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichel postponed the sentence until October, pending the receipt of reports from the social services.
Hogg was released under a bet on the case, but he was detained before hearings on other cases.
It was listed as having committed sexual offences until the date of conviction.
President of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe is not reading that speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the senior African State leader, fell off the platform earlier this year.
He didn't get hurt, but the video from the fall scene was currently spread on social networks.
Parliament ' s opening was also obscured by statements of opposition by Parliament that they had received anonymous threats warning them of the siege of Mugabe during the course of the treatment.
Months ago, they lit the President at his address to the nation in Parliament; that is what Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
A member of Parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change, Innocent Gonez, said that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to interrupt Mugabe.
“The communication came from a number that is not reflected, but it is entitled Death,” he told reporters after the end of Mugabe.
Noted Members of Parliament warned that the integrity of Parliament was being ended, and as soon as they left, the parliamentary integrity of Parliament did not work.
A member of Parliament stated that the party, led by Morgan Zwangiari, was "anxious" about its policies.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to reduce from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs under its service restructuring and reduction programme.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard is divided into two company stock exchanges, separating the production of computers and printers from the more rapidly developing hardware and service sectors.
The estimated reduction in jobs would amount to approximately US$ 2.7 billion, starting from the fourth quarter, as stated in Hewlett-Packard.
"This restructuring will ensure a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Mae Witman, president and Director General Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more focused than Hewlett-Packard currently, and the portfolio of business directions will be wider and deeper to help the company move to a new business style," Witman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual cost of over US$50 billion and “will focus on providing previously inaccessible integrated technology solutions” is reported in a company statement.
This is how the company, founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hullett and Dave Packard, is divided into electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto was called "the birthplace of the Crimean Valley".
Hewlett Packard is in the process of extensive restructuring to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This is the second step in the world of personal computers and one of the largest technical companies in the United States, the latest developments in this sector, based on confidence that the most specialized companies are working better.
Captain "Arsenal" Michael Arteta says his teammates must support the injured Jack Wilshire in front of the game with "Dinamo Zagreb"
In his conversation with Wilshire Wenger, he also stressed that only September was still possible, and that, provided that Wilshire's recovery was planned, he had nothing to do with his return to Christmas.
In the most favourable development of Wilshire events, at least four of the following games will be missed in England and, given what has happened, its participation in the European Championship will remain the subject of the following summer.
Most importantly, this recent problem is that Wilshire has certainly completed the previous season with the only trauma bed and is about to return to the usual aggressive style of the game during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This trauma doesn't threaten his career."
It's just not a living bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just a coincidence.
This is not related to the drawers or injuries that he had previously suffered.
These may be medically related things, but as Wenger has also allowed, there is a risk of additional injuries for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also a negative trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has 23 different injuries that occurred to him in six years since his debut.
He also played only 65 of 157 Arsenal games in the league for the last five seasons.
If you look at the Arsenal schedule wider, you can see that in six of the eight seasons, starting in 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two Premier League clubs, most of which are missing due to the trauma of days.
Wenger recognizes the likelihood of a fall in the vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that the improvement of injury statistics in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you're back in line after the trauma, you've been vulnerable for some time -- you need to regain your strength and gain a competitive advantage," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough and he can do it.
I hope he'll recover physically, I'm sure his career will be what he deserves.
Arsenal is campaigning at the League of Champions on Wednesday with Dinamo-Zagreb and will continue on Saturday with Chelsea and on Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the composition.
Actor Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey didn't come to Croatia, so they'll probably play Mother Debushi and Arteta in the first place.
Perhaps Wenger will also introduce Kiran Gibbs and Olive Giru instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Volkota.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give a little leap to the players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is an unconditional favorite in Group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most striking in Europe.
"Dinamo" has not lost any of the 41 matches since they were able to spend the last season as "Invincible."
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was hit by a 3.2-ball earthquake on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal has learned a lesson in the past season when the team suffered defeat at the Monaco League of Champions, and remains weakly hoping to bring the club to victory at the Cup of Champions.
"It's an incredible drive," Wenger remarked.
Arsenal's never done that before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but, on the other hand, I'm a realist with an internship.
We have ambitions, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons in a manly friendship
The absence of such stories is being overlooked, especially if you consider how desperate the need for men to be frank has become, now more than ever, when the level of suicide among young men is up to 15 years old.
In 2013, this was the only major cause of the death of men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and it will happen to men three times more often than to women.
In an attempt to address the problem of "The Campaign against Unhappiness" in 2015, the Year of Men announced to address the challenges of a culture that does not allow men to seek help when they need it.
The community is at the heart of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of over 2,000 university students with symptoms of depression found that if the patient had a sufficient number of “normal” friends, the chances of treatment were doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of healthy friends doubles the chance of mental disorders.
But, of course, for a friend to work, she needs to be.
In an age when communication is managed by social networks, when the style prefers content, the speed of response is often more appreciated than the content of contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to be strong, loving, and successful, even when loneliness is real.
Such superficial success depends on the fact that psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely through internal values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a greater impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire recently observed, the video gamemaker, you don't buy any more happiness than money.
Friends' dignity is that they draw attention to this.
Each person was determined, not by his work, but, rather, by the personality that was manifested in association with his friends.
Jumor Joey and Chandler's constant engagements, moments of football watching at comfortable chairs, Ross's breathing at Rachel's -- all comes from the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from a full study of their feelings.
As the Samaritan officer told me, "...my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal is to emphasize how even the smallest communication of friends can benefit."
Often the men who approach us feel powerless to talk to their friends.
Old learning "live with it" is as strong as the feeling that open talk about problems can be perceived as weakness."
Friends one of those shows that comes to mind when I'm trying to offer more long-term mechanisms for overcoming.
It highlighted the few moments of a man’s friendship.
With regard to my task, the foreign status of the phone conversation helps people at times of despair, while long-term support comes from close family and friends.
So if you visit FriendsFest at Comedy Central in these exits where the decorations have been completely restored for the holiday, why not take your friends drink in Central Perk.
Or even better, if you see a lonely person in Starbucks, smile and say "Hello."
First, do not imagine what a friendship can do for you.

De Maria kills a target by helping the PSG to melt Malmé.
The Angel of Mary, like Blue Matthew and Edison Cavani, celebrates the slain balls at Malmé's gate.
Angel de Maria, who debuted in the Champions League, scored a goal that allowed the PSG to easily go to Malmé on Tuesday.
Here's a match report and a game reaction.
Angel de Maria and Edinson Cavani did their job when Pari Saint-German started his game at the Champions League with a very comfortable victory 2:0 against Malmé at Park de Princes on Tuesday.
De Maria killed the ball less than four minutes after his first game at the League of Champions began as a "PES" to target the French champions, but they missed out on a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Kawani shot a target at 61 minutes.
Along with Real Madrid and the Dutch Shahter in Group A, Pari had to take a good start in the game against the Swedish champions, because they aimed not to qualify for playoffs, but to continue a series of successful games during the last three seasons, where they reached fourth finals.
They earned their eyes, but at the same time it was not the best decision by Lauren Blan to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovich useless in the attack and later to replace him in the field in the fight against his native city team and club, in which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win home or guests at the Champions League, so to win the 2:0 score, deliver problems to the competitors and play well in the defence is a good start, even if there are other moments that we will need to finish during the season," said Blanc.
That's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did it, although I'm sorry we didn't kill one or two more balls.
Ibrahimovich returned after the trauma in one of the replacements of the Paris team, which brought her nothing with a 2:2 match with Bordo in the First League, but he gave it back to De Maria's last plan for the fourth minute.
The Argentine attacker noted that he was a player capable of delivering PSGs to a new level in Europe after being bought at Manchester United last month, and he proved why when he escaped from Mark Verratti behind Malmé's protection and finished a beautiful attack by sending a ball past Johan Willand to the far corner of the gate.
However, if someone was expecting an easy and great victory from the PSC, they had to be disappointed.
Malmé, who won Seltik in playoff to reach this stage, with nine world-level players in the field at the start of the game, five defenders and two supporters in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But with the exception of the strike by Nikola George, where the ball flew past a further stand by Kevin Trappa's door at 34th minute, they attacked quite a bit.
Therefore, the PSF has been subjected to inconspicuous transmissions and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimic, which only in the first half failed to carry out at least five attempts, and then failed to handle the ball killed by Kavani immediately after the game was resumed.
However, he showed himself much more skilled in accurate passports, and it was a passport from Ibrahimic, receiving that, Di Maria sent the ball with a round punch, which went through the stand by Viland for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally killed after an hour's notice thanks to Kavani, the Uruguayan killed his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimovic stabbed the ball sent to the center of the field from the left flank Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas that Malmé had about getting back into the game, and only the capture of Viland's ball from a very close distance did not allow David Luis to increase the final account before his superior in exchange for Esekiel Lavesses did not count the goal at the end of the match.
Coach Malme Age Harreid later admitted that the PSG was the top of his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last game at the League of Champions was held last December."
Since then, we've been playing only in the Swedish League, and that's not the level.
Not enough qualifications.
"Pearie"!
It was a great match with them.

More than 40 orders and orders were signed by the governor of the Tumen area, Vladimir Yakushev, at the meeting of the regional Government.
Some of these involved the allocation of funds for educational and health institutions in municipal education.
In particular, funds are being made for the acquisition of a bus for one of the schools in the Nizhnetavdin region, for the capital repair of the district hospital in the Kazan region.
As stated in the accompanying documents, the money will be completed at the end of the capital repair of the second floor of the therapeutic office.

There will be a second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus in Sochi on 17-18 September, which will be attended by the Tunisian delegation in the lead with the Governor.
The forthcoming event in Sochi and the interim results of the cooperation are described by the honourable Consulate General of the Republic of Belarus in Tumena Vladimir Shugl, who is a member of the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovic, what are the tasks of the Socinian Forum?
The large event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Federal State.
It builds on fruitful cooperation between the regions, an important link between the two States.
It is planned that the plenary meeting will be attended by the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin and the President of the Republic of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko.
Plenary and sectional meetings will focus on the experience of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policies, the rule of law and the programmes of the Federal State.
The Governor of the Tumen region will take the floor.
I believe that this demonstrates the successful, sustainable interregional cooperation of the region and Belarus.
The forum will also be attended by representatives of Profiling Ministries and Agencies, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tumen region, will be held.
I hope that the forum will help conclude new beneficial contracts and agreements.
I will add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk last June.
More than two hundred delegates, including 19 regions of Russia, participated.
At the same time, a very important treaty on cooperation between the Tumen and the Mining areas was signed.
The importance of our work is also stated by the fact that there has been a permanent seminar in Tumeni at the Russian and Belarus Union Parliamentary Assembly.
In addition, the delegation of the APC of the Tumen region visited the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of Belarusians in training for agriculture, to identify additional convergence points and to organize new investment projects in the agro-industrial complex.
You have recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with the governor of the Tumen region, Vladimir Yakuszewi was talking about the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus in a modernly difficult situation.
The issue of the supply of Belarusian agricultural techniques and the use of financial mechanisms is that they are necessary to reduce the value of machinery for the end user.
Problems were discussed in the work of the Belshina Chamber of Commerce and options for preventing losses.
Matters are important, since investment projects must work and make the region profitable.
Further supplies of OAS passenger and freight technology were discussed, the development of the OAS service centre "MAZ", which was established in Tumena on the OAS-based "TPATP".
The discussion also covered the preparation of a visit by the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus by the end of the current year.
Another topic was the conclusion of an agreement on trade and economic, scientific and cultural cooperation in the Thumenese region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of relations promise to reach a new level.
These issues were also addressed by the Regional Centre.
During our meeting with the head of the Tumeni City Administration, Alexander Moore, we talked about updating the Tumeni Bus Park.
About 100 buses are already "diving on ice", so a new batch of cars from Belarus is required, which will work on a gas, environmentally clean fuel.
Another aspect is that the Tumen elevator company cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of the OAO’s Mohilevliftmash elevator product, which receives the components.
In my view, these activities could become more active, taking into account the programmes for the installation of new elevators in the area centre.
In addition, within the expanded powers of the consulate, a meeting was held with the Governor of the Kurgan Region, Alexie Kokorein, which discussed the issue of increased traffic traffic and the provision of modern Belarusian technology in Zaurala.
A meeting with the German governor was scheduled at the end of September.
The expanded consular district consists of five RF entities, but Thumenen can be called the county headquarters.
The region is a polygon of many promising projects, including the work of the honorable consul.
In general, such meetings are important and good by allowing many problems to be addressed directly and quickly, by taking them into account and by developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current context, it is essential not to destroy the tax by continuing to work on the prospect.
Matt Damon against focusing on the ethnic diversity of people involved in film production
Matt Damon argued with the African-American producer Effi Brown, stating behind the scenes that ethnicity is not necessary.
At the time of the show Project Greenlight on the HBO channel, a well-known actor beat Brown when she tried to highlight the need for alternative views on the main black heroin in the chosen scenario.
"The variety is appropriate when you're throwing for the film itself, not for the show," Damon insisted.
The bright Brown, without faith in his ears, bitterly cried out "Oh, nothing." Well, always while the Martian actor was commenting in the straight air.
For the discussion of the finalists of the show to Damon and Brown, co-sellers Ben Afflek and Brother Farelli joined.
"I would like the participants -- no matter who will be the director -- to think about what the Harmoni image they are going to stick to," Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who is beaten by a white support.
The movie producer Dear White People was saying that the film directors were Leo Angelos and Kristen Brankačo; Damon was strongly opposed, saying that "at last we can get not what we want."
After this discussion was shown on television, social networks exploded with unfavourable comments to Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger at the video: "The explanation of the essence of the diversity of Matt Damon's only black man in the TAKOE BELLOE room, which is painful."
Twitter's got over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon ' s statements were made only once when the literacy of the racial theme in the media was the most pressing issue on the public debate agenda.
After a young man named Michael Brown was shot by a police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained popularity throughout the country, urging legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the color population.
In February, the singer Prince mentioned this movement during the submission of applicants for the album of the year at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and lives of black people, albums still matter.
Recently, the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued an official statement in response to the question of staff member Fox News Elizabeth Hasselbeck as to whether this group would be considered as a group of haters.
"The Network Black Lives Matter is a group of lovers," the movement leaders reported.
It was recently announced that Damon had been included in the list of show business, producer and media magnets invited to visit the Pope in Rome to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation and met with the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" awards the first champion
The professional scale and assistant officer Isaac Kaldjero became the first winner of the American Ninja Warrior show on Monday evening, taking away $1 million prize.
At this sports show, the 7th season of which has just ended, none of the participants have been able to pass all stages of the track with obstacles.
At the end of the season, two participants -- Caldero and operator Jeff Britten -- arrived at the final round.
The final task included a lift of 75 feet in 30 seconds.
Britten did his first job and worked at the appointed time, became the first athlete for the whole story of the American Ninja Warrior, which took place at stage 4, but Kaldjero managed to achieve his goal for three seconds faster than he did his winner.
After the victory that came with incredible work, Kaldjero, who was shocked at winning a million dollars, gave an interview with "E!News".
"To think about it is incredible, I've never earned or lived more than $10,000 a year," said Isaac to E journalists!
And secondly, I've never even imagined what it's like... the future doesn't know.
Executive producer Kent Weid met with the Hollywood Reporter reporters to talk about the final and why Britten, who was the first to cross the track, won't get any money.
According to the rules, the money is received by the fastest participant.
"If the finishing players have more than one, the prize will get the fastest of them," said Wade.
Although money is a wonderful reward and life changes, it still enjoys immense satisfaction.
I don't think he's offended about it.
He's happy for what he did.
He's got tons of panic calls from fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Jeff said to me, "If I was supposed to lose someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we were to change roles.
The show "America Ninja Warrior" will be back with the eighth season, which will begin shooting in spring 2016.
"Detrot Tigers" quietly walk on Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, Tigers is now the last in the Central Division of the American League.
By only pretending to be a mess, the Tigers had won on Tuesday at Minnesota Twins with the result of 5-4 at Targetfield.
Twins missed the chance to cut back on the half-game from Houston Astros and take second place in the playoff by the number of points after the winners.
For the detroits, let's say for one night, it was a return to letter F, which made up most of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how they get," reported manager of Tigers Brad Osmus.
The Tigers Pitcher Alfredo Simon made his contribution to support the attack, resulting in Detroit taking three points in the first two inches, then adding another one in the sixth and the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a painter in 6 1/3 inches and missed three wounds.
It was just his third quality start for nine exits.
"I just want to finish the year with good indicators," said Simon.
I don't want to be more involved in every game in the replacement, so I want to get into the game.
The appointed representative of the Tigers, Victor Martines, was able to strike three blows and have won two injuries -- the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three hits since four hits in the game against Seattle Mariners on July 6th.
"He worked well," said Osmus.
He showed himself well in (battery quality), much better in the battle and kept this quality for the game.
After three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, Twins got their best chance of getting back into the game.
The central host, Byron Baxton, opened an inning game on the left-hand side of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks, making a band, took the first base, and the second bassman Brian Dozer received a strikeout from Simon before taking his place as a left-wing Blan Hardy.
Hardy went through Morera, the only player on the road, who had recently selected Miguel Sano, who picked up a two-line single on the left of right Dr. Verhagen.
With a couple of earlyrs not in the car and comparing the wound at the second base of VerHagen, the third bassman Trevor Pluff was able to take a double-playing.
It was the 27th time for the leading league player in the season when Pluff kicked the ball on the double.
After Detroit added an insurance wound to the first half of the ninth inning, Morer earned RBI a "dab" in space between the outfielders against the closing painter "Tigers" Bruce Rondon, and the account became 5-4.
However, the right-hand player beat Sano after three strikes and got his fifth saw.
Detroit benefited from the temporary failure of Phil Hughes at the start of the game.
Tigers earned three wounds in the first two inches against a deserving drinker, who was on the list of traumatized before the game, without more than a month in connection with the burnout.
"Of course not the start that I would like," said Hughes, "but as I developed the game, I felt more comfortable and so I was able to carry out a few pretty good breaks in the third inning."
After the first batter arrived at the first base, Hughes left a single second bystander named Ien Kinsler.
The eye of two J. D. Martiness morning-fielders took Victor Martines out, who made a single in the middle for the first morning in the game.
Victor Martines finished his "0 for 21" series with the wounded in an effective position.
The third base player Nick Castelianos later did "single", but Victor Martines was beaten in an attempt to get closer to the third base, thus the threat was eliminated.
The Tigers have increased the second-inning account by receiving a single "dable" from Catheter James McCann and two "single" from central Antony Goose, and it's now 3-0.
"It was a powerful hit," said manager "Twins" Paul Molitor.
He wasn't very good, but he got straight to the right point.
Hughes, who was considered to be a broocher, did not bring the third inning’s point, and was replaced by the right-hand reliefr A. J. Ahter.
Husa had three wounds at six strokes and a four-stroke eye.
NOTE: The right-wing Pitcher Tigers, Anibal Sanchez, has been released from the games in connection with the right-hand shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who had performed Sanchez on his shoulder in 2007.
For Sanchez, who is on the list of traumatized from mid-August, it is planned to start in the middle.
In the absence of Sanchez the left-handed Daniel Norris will leave the wounded list and go out against Twins.
Norris, who left the Tigers in four startups from his acquisition in exchange for David Price's left-wing painter on July 30, has 1 victory and 1 defeat.
He was not involved in games since 20 August due to hair loss.
Tigers and Twins are finishing a three-game targetfield series on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will play Erwin Santana Pitch (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original complaint made by Kadyrov in the book "Pray to God" was received by the South-Sakhalin Court.
In the South-Sakhalin City Court, the original appeal was received by the representative of President Chechnya Ramzan Kadirov for the decision to recognize the book "Extremist Material" of "Pray to God: Its Meaning and Place in Islam", says Interfax, referring to President Alexander Chuhray.
The court is now awaiting possible objections from the parties.
Cuzhrai refused to comment on the statements made by some of the MPs by the FF House that there was a need to verify the need to cooperate with foreign services and IGIL.
"Shoot yourself to comment on such nonsense," he said.
On 11 September, the South-Sakhalin City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against Judge Natalie Perchenko's decision to accept the book "Extremist Material".
The South-Sakhalinska Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the prosecutor's office believes that they have asked the court to accept only the extremist's opinion of the author of the book, not the Qur'an.
In the opinion of the prosecutor's office, the judge made the wrong decision," said Chuhrai.
The decision to accept the book “Extremist Material” was taken on 12 August 2015.
In particular, the People of the Book have been cited as saying, "We worship you and ask for your help."
He called the decision-makers of the book "Satans and Provocators".
He called on Members of the House to prohibit the judicial decisions relating to the texts of the sacred writings in law.
"I firmly believe that the Gosmunda must adopt a law that prohibits judicial decisions relating directly to the Koran and other Divine Scriptures," wrote the Kadira in his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments that offend migrants and refugees
Facebook officials intend to remove posts and comments that have negative impact on migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints to the illegal content.
Fighting the manifestations of xenophobia and racism in the network, the Facebook Guide is intended to work with the German Ministry of Justice.
Thus, Heiko Maas, previously head of the department, said that the monument is currently working together with community specialists to create a special group of moderators.
Its participants are obliged to monitor and remove incorrect comments from migrants and refugees.
According to Heiko Maas, it is expected that the authors of intolerance posts will receive notices indicating the reason for their removal.
To facilitate the operational blocking of the illegal content, organizations that are specialized in collecting complaints from users of complaints against abusive posts should also be encouraged.
The Facebook Manual is intended to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative expressions to migrants and refugees, the management of the social network and the Ministry of Justice of Germany was taken after a sharp increase in xenophobic attitudes in the German Facebook segment.
One of the most obvious reasons for them has become unprecedented in their scale a migration crisis involving the Euro-Union country some time ago.
Yes, Germany has already filled all the items intended to accommodate refugees.
Prior to that, the authorities decided to temporarily settle migrants in the territory of the former Buhenwald Concluster.
Enforced internally displaced persons from the Middle East and Africa were placed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners were detained under the Nazi regime.
There will be a zone for relaxation in Moscow.
In the near future, several capitals are equipped with specialized areas for relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first will be the Boutovian, Domodedovian, and the Sarbinian cemetery.
The first area for psychological rest has already appeared in the Troikurov Cave in Moscow.
Such areas will continue to appear in other areas of the city.
The m24.ru portal was told by Artem Ekimov, who is the head of the State Budgetary Institution, Ritual.
Relaxation zones will represent small green areas that remind parks.
In the opinion of experts, such "angles" will enable visitors to rest, stay alone and restore psychological strength.
In the near future, relief zones will be built in Domodedow, Boutow and Sharbin Bays and then in other areas of the capital.
According to the GBU chapter, Ritual, where there is a need to expand the site, the builders will try to keep the existing forest masses as far as possible.
Green plantations will serve as a live fence that will divide the area of rest and areas directly below the burial site.
The GBU experts, Ritual, also stated their intention to propose a waiver of the funerals.
New dolls can really become unstoppable.
In addition, the GBU "Ritual" described the readiness to use electronic terminals to enable visitors to learn about GPS coordinates and burial numbers.
In June of this year, the GBU "Ritual" also proposed adjusting the value of burying services according to the year.
Yes, the burial site in summer time will stand on a thousand rubles cheaply, during the winter weeks when the earth is frozen.
It should be noted that during the past year, rates for all types of ritual services have travelled on an average of 10 per cent.
Five days later, in the forest of Elsa, an elusive reefer was found.
The elderly man proved to be alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without commission.
The discovery of a mountain mine was successful through the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "The 79-year-old pensioner from the Tambow area spent five days in the forest."
No food and no water.
He was wanted by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even dogs in the movies, but there was no result.
The discovery of a man was made after the helicopter was connected to the search.
On that day, Vitaly Aleksandrovich, as usual, went to the woods behind his tail and backyards, but didn't come back to dinner.
The family immediately sought help, and by the next day, about 30 people were raised to rescuers and residents from neighboring villages.
On the fifth day, a fire safety centre helicopter joined them.
Andrei Seletkov, head of the search rescue team at the fire-resistance centre of the Smolen Region, said: "The helicopter has been pulled, the man has been found."
He's gone very far, quite elsewhere.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He's been a long way off at his age.
A miracle remained alive.
The deer was delivered to the Greek central district hospital unconsciously, in a very difficult condition.
Doctors have diagnosed pneumonia, as well as severe decommissioning and refrigeration of the body.
As an elderly man was able to stay alive after five days in the forest, doctors do not seem to be present.
Valentina Nepša, head of the Greek CBC's Therapeutic Division: "A patient study, treatment."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Taking into account all his chronic diseases.
The patient’s condition has improved in the morning and remains severe, but with positive dynamics.
Vitaly Aleksandrovich retires every year to Smolenština from the Tambov area.
His grandson says that his grandfather used to go to collect mushrooms, but he never got deeper in the woods.
Alexei Spitchenko, the grandson of a miner who was found, said, "Less not far from the road, not in principle local."
For a few years, he had come to visit his family.
Well, he went after the mushrooms.
Looks like he's gone a long way and he's gone wrong.
At the start of the funnel season, people are regularly lost in all areas of the Smolen region.
Only in the last few days have there been five similar cases.
Rescuers remind us that we need to walk in the woods in a light dress, with a small supply of food, sleeping, and compass.
In addition, it is desirable to leave traces behind so that they can be returned.
Accidental An-2 on average in a brother's taj.
Right on the average village in Siberia, an emergency An-2.
An external landing of the Red Air Force "Enisei" took place 68 kilometres from Bratska.
No one was killed or injured, but the plane itself suffered considerable damage on the ground.
An-2 made an official trip.
There were three crew members on board, the commander, the second pilot and the ship mechanic, reports "Interfax".
The aircraft was flying on the railway Railway-Ilimsk-Achinsk, which is based on the airline.
The plane crew has already been delivered to Bratsk.
Following an emergency landing of An-2, the Federal Transportation Prosecutor ' s Office began to verify compliance with flight safety legislation.
The investigation team of the East Siberia Transport Prosecutor ' s Office was on the scene.
In September 2010, Tu-154 crew deployed their aircraft with passengers due to technical failure to land-based aircraft in the Commission.
On the liner, the engines and ship electronics were rejected, but the crew made it impossible.
On board, there were 10 crew members and 72 passengers.
No one was injured in the emergency landing.
News Economics - Nobel laureate: globalization
The printing of globalization processes should have contributed to the reduction of world inequality.
In fact, the situation seems to be different, but the difference in the income of the population in developing economies is growing.
Eric Maskin.
In order to correct this, it is necessary to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers, considered by the Chief Scientific Officer of the International Laboratory for the Analysis and Selection of Decisions of the NIS, the Nobel Prize for the Economy of 2007 by Eric Maskin.
In the past 20 years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become more open.
Globalization partners predicted great benefits for the developing economies.
"And these predictions have happened in many ways," says Maskin.
For example, China and India have experienced a significant rise in GDP per capita.
However, not all are so happy.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between “poor” and “poor” in poor countries, which was largely income-inequity and, more precisely, wages.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article "Why global markets did not reduce inequality in developing economies," published in The World Bank Economic Review, which he translated and quoted as NUE.
Along with economists, Professor of Harvard University Michael Kremer Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the income gap in poor countries is increasing as the number of countries is growing, the NUE is reminding the NUE.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, the Machine allocates four levels of professional qualifications - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, poor D professionals from poor countries did not have sufficient qualifications to cooperate with A and B professionals from rich countries.
And if the level C workers from poor countries are growing by cooperation with the B staff from the rich, the D workers do not feel or their salaries fall.
The result is that the internationalization of production will contribute to an increase in the wage gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and, accordingly, to an increase in inequality.
The Kremer and E. Maskini have proposed a wonderfully beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantages.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fuad Alekscherov, professor-in-chief of the International Laboratory of Analysis and Choice, head of the Department of Mathematics of the U.S.U.N.U.S.
And like any powerful theory, I'm sure it'll bring about an empirical work in this area.
The problem, according to Eric Maskin, is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the researchers themselves say that they do not have the means to do so and that companies are not in a position to pay for their training.
In this situation, Governments, international agencies, NGOs and private funds can play a significant role.
The scientist notes that the developed theory does not in any way call for a halt to the process of globalization, which has produced and produced its fruits in the form of GDP growth in countries.
Derbent: A live connection of time.
Derbent, one of the oldest cities in Russia, noted his 2000s in September.
The holiday programme is the national culture festival of the peoples of Dagestan and the past style fair, the exhibition of derbent covers and the Day of Open Temples, the historical and music show "2000 years in two hours" and the tour at the reconstructed Peter I Museum.
The medieval fortress of Narin-Kala, the ancient Arab inscriptions on the walls, the narrow slabs and the gardens are all from the thousands and one night pages.
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has remained in its place since ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, the Byzantines, the Hazhar Kaganat and the Golden Order.
The age of the eastern plains, which grow in the yard of the Derbent Juma mosque, is equal to several centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Rossian Program "The Trees of Living Nature".
The shade of scattered crowns saves palm trees and tourists during summer heat.
A visitor of the mosque will have a taste of tea and a taste of Dagestian cuisine, such as honey butter, churme, musculoskeletal, beauty, iron and sweetness.
In Derbente, for centuries, there have been many suicides in order to drink a cup of tea from many guests.
The signpost on the entrance to the Juma mosque says that the building was built in 115 Hijri.
That's in 733 on the Gregorian calendar.
It's the oldest bear in Russia.
The interior is affected by the range and festiveness: the arcades of domes and reservoirs are based on square columns and are illuminated by the rays of the sun from tiny windows.
The content and divorce of the pigeons is traditional involvement of the people of Derbenta.
The owners of the house put pigeons in the courtyards, under trees, on herbs.
It's a fascinating sight, a flight into the sky of white pigeons like the sparks of a holiday fireworks.
In order to defend the enemy, the ancient Persians covered the Caspian gates with a double stone wall.
Going 500 meters into the sea, this facility shut down Derbent's van.
In 2003, the fortress walls of Derbenta were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best preserved monument to ancient Persian Fortification.
The roofs in Derbente were still warm in the fifth century, and by our day, the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged.
On one of the street markets, blankets are sold at any taste of sheer, boy or ware of all colors and shades, with bone and without it, with a complex ornament and a beautiful fireplace.
The construction of the city began with the macaroni and the flats with the same stone structures.
Over the years, the magals have not changed.
Only satellite plates, wall air conditioning and street lights remind you that you are not in the Middle Ages, but in the modern city.
In the old part of the city, details of the watercourse built by the Persians about a thousand years ago were preserved.
To our day, ancient sources have come where locals are also gathering water.
Many derbents prefer ordinary water from tap water from verified historical fountains.
In Derbente, there was one of the centers of the gonadal craft.
Flying and scissors, candles, candles, cups were appreciated throughout the Caucasus.
The hands of the goncars are now producing remarkable ceramic products, both practical and sovereign.
On holidays and festivals, a crowd of spectators gathers under the high - pressure canal at which students of the Republican School of Circumstances speak.
The history of amazing and risky craftsmanship has been around for centuries.
A new trend among Canadians is that girls are more and more visible.
The Museum of Culture and the House of Ancient Derbent is now located in the former Virgin's bathroom.
There were previously single girls and bridesmaids in the company of friends, and now anyone who wanted to see a pool, a hot and cold pool sitting in the past bathroom.
In most Derbenta houses there is hot water, but baths and couples are popular in our day as they were in the past.
The benefits of warming up the body are written in ancient books.
After the bath, the blood improves, the muscles lose weight, the body acquires flexibility and ease.
The Societies Festival, which is held in the Narin-Kala fortress, is attended by ethnic courts in many areas of Dagestan.
The participants in the national costumes danced, played folk tunes, performed the songs of the Caucasians, and enjoyed the guests with delicious home cheese.
Kirchlar is the burial place of forty martyrs who have heads behind Islam.
It is one of the most respected complexes for the Muslims of the North Caucasus.
From time to time, sarcophagus has been cut off from whole stone blocks and, as adopted by Arabs, has been directed to the west-east axis.
The brothers Gabriel and Albert Jacobs strangle and cook customers in a small living room next to the upper pool.
Parikmahersky has been in this place for many years.
Circumstances are passed from generation to generation.
Jacob’s brothers can do not only traditional but also most modern.
On one of the streets of the Old Town, a house was kept in which the writer-decabris Alexander Bestužev-Marlinski was laid down in the Caucasus.
After learning Turkish and collecting ethnographic material, he described Derbent in the first third century C.E. with his ancient monuments, life, and residence.
Tea is a traditional Eastern club where only tea and homemade ovens are served.
Men come here to satisfy their thirst, communicate with their friends, and solve some work problems.
As in the past, it is not recommended for women to break the tea threshold.
The Deerbent Dance Ansemble Kaspiya was established three years ago, but had already been able to participate in the activities of the Republican and Russian levels.
The ensemble’s soloists repeat each day, studying national accidents, Targinic, Dadic, Armenian dances.
As the evening comes, when there is noise and street lights are on, local residents are scattered on the benches near the homes with the speaker’s terrazzo.
The Derbents usually discuss domestic issues.
But they are more and more often reminded of the unique history of their city, which has affected the fate of the entire region of Montenegro and Caspian.
Domoded's had a business game at the airport.
A new form of education is being found in the capital.
Four hundred students have tried themselves as airport staff.
For this purpose, three aircraft models were installed in Domodedov.
Young people not only watched and recorded passengers but also served aircraft.
All of this is a business game, but it has not become a reality.
The late voyages, immediately two passengers with break-ins on board, lost the trap somewhere on the way to the plane.
For this airport - ad.
For those who were based in Domodedova, the standard set of tasks is to be decided by new people.
In one Angola, three major airports from different countries of the world joined immediately.
There are now four hundred students from city colleges and colleges.
It is an unprecedented opportunity to learn all about the internal world of aircraft.
The registration of passengers, the maintenance of aircraft, the handling of luggage were entrusted to them even by buses in the summer field, stairs, and inspection of passengers.
And passengers are in trouble.
In one conflict with the documents, the other was late on the journey, the third filled the bag with suspicious objects.
And all of this needs to be understood, as in life, at a minimum.
For each of these tasks, they are charged a certain amount, virtual cash, as if the airline had paid them the corresponding amounts for the travel service.
“For failing to perform these tasks, a fine is charged”, explains the financial analyst for Dmitry Hillko in an interview with the Moscow news programme.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely following.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try a new form of education.
She is already in high school.
“There will be six interregional centres of competence, which will become, in fact, new models of activities of modern colleges with modern management, with highly qualified staff, with modern equipment,” explains the director of State Policy Department in the field of training and additional vocational education of Russian Minobrnauka Natalya Zolotareva.
Therefore, students are not up to global plans.
After three days of such training, they seem to need an exit.
Therefore, the evaluations for this examination had a very substantive expression.
Newest smart eyes, the best I've ever seen!
"I got them for responding in time to the claim to our airport in Instagram," is a happy player, pilot manager of the "Airport Frankfurt" team, Sergey Shualov.
The best judges, which is called, took a stand to be invited to work by the time the study was completed.
The United States Embassy regrets the closure of the United States Centre in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the American Centre ' s foreign literature library.
The Centre has been working in Moscow for over 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian Government to close the U.S. Embassy Centre at the M.I. Rudomino State Library in Moscow.
"The unilateral steps recently taken by the RF raise questions about the commitment of the Russian Government to relations between Russian and American peoples that have not been interrupted even during the cold war and in other difficult times of our country's long history," says US Ambassador John Teft, who entered the "Interfax".
The American Centre has established deep and strong ties between people and Russian and United States culture.
He was the centre of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and served as a venue for meetings with many American prominent actors, including cosmonauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
"Only last year did the American Centre conduct more than 400 cultural and educational activities and took over 50,000 Russian visitors," the diplomat stressed.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the FLEX Future Leaders Exchange Programme.
The Green Court was quick to prosecute.
Typical situation: Four officers are standing at the table of Judge Svatter Kumar, hearing his claim for the work done.
The court is not entirely satisfied with the quality of your work.
We have not given you a single order of 110 pages, so that you may be comforted," says Kumar.
If there's one more piece left, we'll order all the existing buildings to be removed.
Kumar is headed by the National Green Tribunal (NPT), a judicial authority established in 2010 to stop the rapid pollution of the environment, resulting in the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
At that time, the Tribunal was able to consider more than 10,000 claims related to air pollution, waste collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two of the three cases, the court shall decide on the cessation of the construction leading to pollution.
Incredibly high rates: over the past 60 years since the declaration of independence of enhanced industrial development, India has become a virgin jungle country in one of the most populated and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is particularly acute in large megapolises, where infrastructure development is not speeding up the rush of urbanization: the city is covered by dense power, the rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from businesses and households, and few remaining housing masses are cut off by new residential quarters.
Despite the formal support of the green movement by the State, NZT is regularly criticized by the Government of Narendra Modi, as it is often the main cause of the cancellation of major investment projects.
Thus, in May this year, the Minister of the Environment referred to the Court's judgments as “extreme” and “implementable”.
Sometimes it is not possible to comply with court decisions within the time limit set by the court, the environmental lawyer Raj Panzhvani.
However, there is also a positive side to non-compliance: at least they force responsible persons to move.
"His main goal is to break this system," adds the lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has already abolished large structures on a number of occasions: its account is to stop the construction of an airport, an electric station and hundreds of smaller facilities.
They also try to keep people in mind: for example, during the discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnan, which contaminated the local river with a foriod.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People are losing their jobs," Kumar commented.
Such explanations, however, are not always understood by ordinary people, whose lives can be changed by a single branch of a judge.
Thus, in April, the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles from entering the capital for more than 10 years, as a result of national repression.
Despite the severe decline in popularity and criticism, Svatanter Kumar refused to revoke the decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics from the Government of the Department on the arrival and departure of road transport, and offered to purchase 10,000 additional buses, which he knew in advance at the factories whether they were in a position to comply with such an order.
As the Court began to focus on sources of pollution, such as waste, fuel quality and even road accidents, the people ' s anger began to slow down.
But the most painful topic of the principle judge was the Gang River Cleanup Program, with a pump announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to Gange, a sacred Hindu river, the judge often ceases to hold his emotions and goes on shouting.
You know what the word "holy" means?
Someone poured water out of Ganga into the statue of God, and there were faeces in it, and the judge was hot.
You continue to contaminate the river because you think that Gang is Gang, he will take away all our sins.
This is the river we worship, and see what you do with it every day.
The cleaning of Ganga is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new Government.
The number of faecal bacteria in this river is now more than 120 times the norm.
Each year between 1.5 and 3 out of 700 million incubators die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated money to the Gang Rescue Fund to sell his costume, where he met Barack Obama and 455 items from his personal collection.
Ecologists here accused the prime minister of populism: the suit was bought for $700 thousand, while at least eight billion were required to clean up the river.
The Green Tribunal ' s partners agree that India must go a long way before it can be called a developed country, but they do not believe that the cost of progress should be an ecological one.
“In the developing country, environmental talks are often perceived as an unacceptable luxury,” says the activist, Malik Bhanot.
And the court is trying to find a golden middle between ecology and development."
The man shed a few pictures of Dali on the exhibition in Riga.
A visitor to the Latvian Union of Artists' Exhibition in Riga broke the window into the museum and exported the sculpture of Salvador Dali "Avement of the Angel".
The museum is now hosting an exhibition of the work of Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso.
The man was born in 1985 in the sculpture hall at 14:20.
He immediately led the wrong way: he brought out the sculpture, he broke windows.
He then started moving around the premises and covered several works of a permanent exhibition with blood.
Among them is the portrait of Myervaldis Police's Message.
According to the President of the Latvian Union of Artists, Igori Dobicina, which is referred to as the Interface, bottles were also exported.
Police and artistic experts are at the scene.
The latter determine the size of the damage and damage.
A criminal case of slander has been brought against the man.
In the Latvian Union of Artists from 4 August to 27 September, the work of Picasso and Dali is presented with more than 200 original works of artists.

Si Zinpini calls for a more open economy for peace
The economy should be more open to the world to boost its growth, as President C. Zinpin said on Tuesday in addressing a group facing the challenge of reform management.
“China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and developing a policy of openness,” he said, addressing participants in the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group on the Comprehensive Intensification of Reform.
He said that increasing openness and deepening reforms would add new momentum and vitality to the economy and provide new space for economic development.
The Steering Group adopted a number of directives, including the regulation of market access for investors, the amendment of border control rules, the promotion of public enterprises (SOEs) involving private capital and the revision of the population registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be phased out through test programmes.
This is an important step since it will provide the market with a more important role in the allocation of resources, the rule of law in business and the promotion of openness, as stated in the statement.
The Government would also weaken control of the powers granted to companies, thereby ensuring that companies would carry out their own business.
The statement also states that China will allow border regions to adopt new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to enhance local growth.
More areas will be available to private investors to increase the openness of the sub-control State in the economic sectors.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of companies with foreign funding and provide them with better conditions,” the statement said.
It will also facilitate the application procedure for permanent residence for foreigners, or “green card”, by optimizing requirements and simplifying the delivery process itself.
The meeting also discussed the rights of lawyers and the training of judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report issued after the meeting, Prime Minister Lee Ketan and Ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli were also present.
