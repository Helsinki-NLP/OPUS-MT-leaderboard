The great return of the Czech bastard is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was invited to NHL
Czech hockey dealer Pavel Francouz, who has been going through his hard career in recent months, returns to NHL.
A 40-year-old pulsary cousin will be in the middle and soon he can get to the market.
Former Lithuanian, Plzno, or Russian Čeljabinskir was wounded in preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
Just in the middle of the fight with Vegas, he's been running and hasn't been present at the NHL clubs ever since.
The incident occurred at a time when the experienced dealer moved from one point to the other.
"Paul Franz will be out for about three to four weeks with injuries in the lower part of the body," the whole of Denver announced at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL branch was finally extended for more than two months.
On Sunday morning, he was called from a farm where he took four dueles and showed his old form.
As a result, 94.5% of the AHL was involved.
The Plenary Hockey Rehabilitation wants to finally sit down and confirm that it belongs to the best league in the world.
In his last year, he had problems with his jaws and in his short pandemic year, he did not have a single match.
In the NHL "Francík", 36 races were held, with a success rate of 92.3%.
Charles on his Christmas wish saturates Camille Ruška, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate chose family photographs taken during their trip to Jordanska as this year’s Christmas wish.
He also published his wish by Prince Charles, who used the photograph on which his cousin Camille helped put on his boots.
On its websites, the British BBC news station reported on this.
They send wishes to friends, collaborators and the funds they cooperate with.
The photograph was taken in the desert.
Cambridge's nuns are dressed in long summer dress in khaka color and dress is also Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing the same clothes as Prince George and Louis' shirts and shirts.
Who took the picture, William and Kate didn't take it, it's not even clear when it was exactly.
Last year the royal family for photography intended as a Christmas wish called for a package of straws in front of a pile of wood in its rural settlement in Norfolk County.
The image that serves as a Christmas wish was also published by Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein caught in June at Ascot's hits.
Charles, who has a cylinder on his head and a shirt on his face, helps Camille put her shirt in a colourfully decorated dress.
Slavia according to efhotbal.cz promised Berbro's million for a title, the Düfdík denied it.
Prague – Criminalists in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former vice-president of the Czech Football Association Roman Berbr was to have from Prague a promised million crowns for a league title in 2018/19.
He informed the efhotbal.cz server about this by getting to the police records.
The president of the representation of the top club Jaroslav Tvärdík said that the red clothing had not been allowed to conduct any corruption.
The server has published a review of police missions, in which the former sports director Jan Nezmar, who died in the summer at the Master's Club, is mainly represented by Slavia.
One influential red-haired officer was in frequent contact with both Berbre and former sports director at the time of Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also in charge of the accused.
The criminals reportedly worked with information that Slavia Berbro promised a financial reward when she received a title.
2019 team SK Slavia Prague won the title in the first league.
The police department had made it clear that Roman (Berbr) should have promised a million-dollar salary from SK Slavia Prague officials for the league win, quoted the server from the record.
The day later, according to criminals, Berbr met with Nezmar not only, but also with the chairman of the Slavie Durdík.
According to the server, the file does not continue to reveal whether this information is still being handled by the police.
The defendant refused any corrupt proceedings.
Between 2015 and 2017 we actively tried to change the relationship in Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never accepted illegal negotiations, tried to influence decision-makers in violation of fair play rules, and we have not provided anyone with any financial implementation in this regard," said the Report List.
In the latter, among others, Nezmar does not necessarily offend some former Slavia dark-skinned players and also abuses his former head of the Hardy.
The alleged influence of the fights through the decision-makers broke up last year in mid-October police intervention at several places including the Prague seat FAČR.
The highest position in the afaire is Berbr, which no longer appears in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, as well as a former sports director, Vyšehradu Rogoz was released from prison.
The helicopters, tanks and bvp are larping cold wars.
They will be new, but in principle of a worse type (the shooters have to wear handcuffs without covering).
Car - Toyoti hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various tankers - at a decent level, in addition, has already managed to get rid of Prague V3S even in specialized units.
Flights: combat- decent, but at the end of the rent, transportation - very small with short but modern flight.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we don't have at all (but we manufacture and export abroad)
PVO: medium-term - cold, old; short-term - good, modern, relatively good number.
I've got a story like that.
I've got a hunt right next to the city.
They went out of the river to feed and damage the crops, so I was sitting there.
When I came, I saw a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to do a brothel, so I sat quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before something went down, but of course the fox was gone in a while.
I let her come 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost fucked up, he had his head on all sides, so I called him that it was on the shelf.
Before I got off the property, it was gone.
And a man's hip is a peach.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a game of a lot of chance to happen, you'd probably be seeing in a thermovision that's almost everybody's got today.
So in the visible place, expensive things get your feet into the trap and you should be okay.
The army versus Hamaque.
Intro received breathers significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The State responsible for the purchase and distribution of frogs, masks and spiritists for the profession closest to the crowner, has issued billions of crowns on their premises in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during one day the amounts on the breather varied by up to a hundred crowns.
Why were prices so dramatic?
Which authorities have been doing business?
And why did others buy a fence?
Lenka Kabrhel talks to the editor of the server iRozhlas Dominik Kubišt.
I respect soldiers and armies (as if I have not been struck by memories of the ČSLAs that have passed through the older generations), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the mandatory war.
We don't even have large technical stocks that training can take, we don't have modern technology, we don't have existing professionals, and modern technology is getting more and more complicated, so the stockpiles' capabilities are going to lose quickly in time.
The modern conventional conflicts where they can be planted will be played very quickly, there will be no time for anyone to practice again.
Finally, depositors/territorial defences have great importance for countries such as Ukraine, where they are going to lead mass guerrillas, and this is also an express need for the deterrence of the enemy.
In the Czech Republic, fighting will take place only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where fertilization will be irrelevant, and we have no proper geography.
We don't have an individual skill.
That's not even the worst.
The worst part is that half of them play like they should.
Then set up a situation like you're looking at a guy who didn't hit an empty door two minutes back, he's going to attack himself between two or even three Swiss people and he says, "Tvl and what do you think is going to happen now?"
Of course they'll choose him as the average taxpayer.
The situation with this "behave defender" is so terrible that I agreed that I was truly surprised when I saw that our attacker was able to play a rival player.
First ownership
Covid pandemic slows down, but experts for the next few weeks don't expect any major return.
The effort in hospitals according to statistical models will last for some time and the Pandemic equation has been, as we know, a new unknown: the micron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the present dominant Delta.
At the same time, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can lead to a more serious course of action, as long as it helps to anticipate or post-infectious immunity obtained by previous disease recovery.
This week, however, an unexpected phenomenon occurred on the side of the plus: treatment possibility.
A new medicine, an antiviral drug, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalization of a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented by paxlovid from Pfizer, which from today's results reports success of up to 85 percent.
However, the first deliveries of mollupiravir to the Czech Republic, apart from the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against coronavir pandemic, also raised the question of how the administration is prepared for the coming of this medicine.
As has been said, the first to receive monnupiravir in Merck is for foreign patients.
The company ended up in the belt as the first and because the drug began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find suitable treatment for viral disease of horses on the South American continent.
In this research, people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.) are often warned.
are generally less open and openly do not share their views.
That's why Eastern Europeans, and especially the Czechs, we're used to talking "how our teeth have grown".
See, you do research where people ask if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people don't know about it.
In the West, they tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist bastards.
And then they go and choose sides like AfD.
They're afraid of canceling culture, saying this to the public means losing their job and media lynch.
Then it looks nice in the research, west good, east bad.
But he'll really find out what people think.
It's just in France Le Pen and Zemmoura, they both have a survey of over 20%.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical.
Identical for the purpose of uniting so that soldiers don't have to learn where it is again, so all objects on the bench are the same.
One of them is the Atom Brdy Museum and the two remaining two are abandoned.
The funny thing is, the sssr didn't want to have a nuclear head in his own territory, either for security or for speeding up the head.
In these underground covers (in each spring there are two) only the heads were kept not all the missiles as they are called.
If there was a need to install this weapon, there was a special unit that picked up this head and mounted it on some portable device.
Besides the museum's apple, they're left in a state of desolation.
At the second grade of elementary school, we had a Cighan partner, and we were with him for four years.
He was all right, he made good jokes, often when he showed up too much, but it was our mask.
He was having fun with everyone, often going and wanting to explain something, missing a little, going regularly, sports was devoted to us, not stealing candles, not even phones, walking clean clothes.
He also rode to schools in the countryside, made various ossuarys, but he was fine, maybe never a proselyte.
In the eighth or ninth grade, the relatives, gypsies, entered the same year, another class.
In short, they beat the teacher, she often solved something police, threatened and threatened other students.
I personally sometimes sell something for an ad (old things I don't need, etc.) and I've been selling to the gypsies often, the money they always had, didn't try to pull me at the price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car like this, and a guy called in a month ago that he already had it overwritten.
I'm saying to myself that I'm not a racist, I don't care if someone's white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as he behaves as he does in decent society (works, works, women don't fight, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes, he pulls his hand, he builds apartments and houses, he's just in trouble, he's making problems, he's kind of like his color, but I'm gonna care.
I don't have a problem with African migrants, if they get involved with us, start business, work, learn language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my tradition and culture, I'll be here.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachatic
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite the resurrection care, was sad to suffer from her injuries at the site," said Zuzana Fajtlová, a law spokesperson for Yugoslav health defenders.
The accident probably blamed the driver who took the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot brand probably drove from the village of Zíchovec to the Bay of Bavaria and for unknown reasons he went in the direction of the opposite direction.
After the crash, Škodou Octavia finished the Peugeot vehicle on the roof outside the vehicle, described the accident of the Yugoslav police spokesperson Štěpánka Schwarz.
A young driver of Peugota suffered a very serious injury in an accident.
It was a lot of injuries and remained locked in the car.
After his release, he had to be provided with acute pre-infirmary care and was transported to the Czech Buddhist hospital in a stable condition, as observed by the Savior of Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the second car had suffered a slight chest injury and was transferred to the hospital.
New rules apply to packages from countries outside the EU, customers often do not provide data about them
Lukas Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He's got his pick-up cards mostly.
"It can usually be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars higher, where it still pays to import, especially from Japan, where mail is often free," the collector is approaching.
Since October, the order for small consignments has been slightly distorted, it has to re-attach VAT and then forward the data to the customs authorities.
He will receive an e-mail informing the customs authorities that they are expecting the arrival of the package.
Then it shall be sufficient to fill the consignment details, and if VAT has not already included the trader in the sale, the customs office shall measure it from the total amount for the consignment and for the transport.
In the event that the addressee does not provide for a customs procedure on his own, the total amount must also be paid by the carrier.
According to Lucas Neuheisla, the whole process is not complicated.
I'm gonna call one or two interlocking poles, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
It's mostly a five-minute question for me, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments can be delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the international mail in Prague fell daily from 60 thousand to 15 thousand.
Moreover, according to the Czech Post, the problem is that people do not respond to the challenges of providing the data needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently there are 30,000 shipments to be processed in international mail.
If people were to fill out all the data they need and fill it in time, then we would be around half here, the Czech mail spokesman Matyaš Vitík said.
Inflation solution
See the title, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% of inflation and it is expected to grow further.
What do you think should be done to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We need to see in Poland a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this your way?
What do you think happens to what is inevitable with where it's going?
Prices are growing faster than wages, I believe it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (who is the employee)?
I was added 2% in the rough this year, which is ridiculous, but fortunately I have a similar income from the company that I operate in my employment.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why the demonstrative testimony of violent people is being sent on the network for only six months?
This head just doesn't take me how the court can send a six-month-old animal out of the net just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to his/her victim being traumatized for several years, negatively affecting her sexual relations and relationships as a whole.
And it's not about the victim of rape that never has to be remembered.
Doesn't this even give rise to a potential future report of rape of the victim?
A man from Hroba "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from Hrob reluctantly helped the officers to secure his nationwide looking for a friend from Kostomlat, on whom a warrant was issued to arrest.
He called them to him himself.
He's been on it for a while.
First, he spoke to the traveling overseer, and he invented a story that he was stolen.
After calling the police station, the police arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged "stealer" told them that he had invented everything to get the officers to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the officers on how to give notice to the Czech Police.
At the time of checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers found that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in the state investigation, and a warrant was issued to arrest her.
That's why the PCR is dealing with the case.
An honest question for people here, do you think our country is Slovak?
I personally feel that we are not ethnically or culturally famous, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with me, of course, that Churchill failed to secure the release of Prague USA :')
Of course, I don't deny that we have Slovenian.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can really believe something without any evidence just because it might be beneficial.
I wouldn't consider such a case to be the true faith.
Here with Pascal I can't agree, there's a estimate in the world if I'm not mistaken, something about ten thousand different religions.
Which god or god does a man choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in one of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will torment you badly if you believe in another god.
But even in the wilderness there is no god but Jehovah.
So in such a case, would it not be more rational to hold faith in any god than to risk choosing the wrong one of those thousands of gods and the one real god that I just didn't meet, send me to hell or somewhere like that?
Other: Voluntary training with next booking.
The Swiss model is similar to a shower.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months per one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If a person behaves well, he can get a professional offer.
All the ACP files would have been worth it.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can speak like this: There is still a love for cooperation between the education sector and industry, companies hunting in schools, and there is some kind of drift when the workforce migrates from educational institutions to working conditions.
Not only in adulthood, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
Similar spillage should also work between the civil and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a relationship between a citizen and an army, that is, an institution that guarantees that Russia, Germany, or possibly the Mongolian driver will never break up here.
I think it's funny how you think NATO is something that's stuck in the rock, we have allies, and they'll defend us if it comes to the tunnel.
Well, you'll enjoy it.
There is only one election in the United States that will crush their budget and the whole of NATO goes to the bottom.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Polish have once again shown themselves enough to show their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that has long served as the guarantor of independence is an armed army after the teeth and a population that can control military technology of its time.
And today he can pilot remotely controlled means of every teenager, so it wouldn't be.
We don't need a border restraint, it's a farce today, but a player behind a remote-controlled device will be able to handle it.
How to drown in boxing
You're packing presents under the Christmas tree and all of a sudden, you're stuck in the house with boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is again used by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
That's why a business map that your used boxes welcome.
And it's not just about Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulation.
That's why it's a shame to treat them like a one-time waste.
Anyone may, after agreement, bring into the involved trade (the KAMsNIM.cz project folder contains almost 150) cartons, plastic or paper boxes.
This will support small companies, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overloaded blue containers.
The individual shops welcome packages that are currently on the market and also saved money, as the package leaflet has been 50 % in the last period.
In the eyes of environmentally sound customers, I also strengthen my brand.
One such shop is TERRA VERDE, a producer of eco-drugs and eco-cosmetics.
However, the boxes and filling materials are used to bring us to Popovek at Brno by individuals who gather at home, and we are called upon by the companies with which we have agreed regular links to the deposited cartons.
We'll use everything when packing the shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies together, we create a more considerate world.
Our desire is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature to another generation, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only pick-up places for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to bring the sorted waste from the home where to deliver past medicines, pneumatics, used electricity, batteries, light sources, large-scale waste, etc.).
All wastes can end in the right place. In addition, renewables will find their second home.
The overall project map already contains more than 100,000 such sites.
“It gradually includes collecting halls, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity halls, SWAPs and other places that help to find uses for things that would otherwise become redundant”, adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the company Clean Czech Republic.
I'm more at fault that today's technology is so simple and stupid that kids who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but they don't learn basic computer skills.
The problem recently emerged (especially in English articles) that students in high schools do not understand the principle of computer components.
Because Google Photos or Apple Apps on photos or actually mobile phones generally simply hide the underlying file system with folders and push everything on one screen in the application.
It's okay if they use childhood technology, but especially if they learn something.
Let's rewrite the stories, really.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU Presidency – starting in January – before the weekend, and it was great.
Macron spoke over an hour during which he discovered the presidency's logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many actions that they would not be able to arrive in half a year.
French politicians like that, but they like it, and they like voters.
Macron's supporters of the right-to-left gap agree a little, but just in Europe, yes.
And in France there will be a new election of the head of state in April.
The election calendar has influenced the priorities itself.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is prepared to create conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately criticized Macron for being pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, it's trying to defend more than rewrite history.
The very right candidate for French President Éric Zemmmour is now traveling to France, saying that the regime of Vichy, who was working with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and it is quite a success for the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of a story teacher seriously and let's not look at the event in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries are taught history as a story of us versus them and never as a story of the whole.
The Spanish, the French, the Czechs know who won the battle.
But if they don't have a bright office, they won't know what was the broader context of the event.
The film of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
The Czech Mouse didn't win.
The story that returns to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre also won recognition for the director and the best actress Jasna Duričić.
At the Karlovarian Festival this year, he was held at the first sights of the theatre.
The best actor in Berlin became Anthony Hopkins for the Father movie.
I'm not too young. I'm not too healthy.
It was like "to have a flu/to be sucked" for a couple of days and I didn't have much to smoke...
It was worse than normal flu.
I don't have time for flu.
(Only personal experience.
Christmas Book Tips
The Christmas double number, which will expire on 20 December, will contain a traditional literary annex.

And the fact that the way back to instincts is shorter than a person's willingness to admit
The author in his last novel will tell a much less sentimental story about the return from emigration than we used to listen to.
Those who stay, and those who leave, know about themselves too little to spend it on a common life.
Trains begin to run according to the new driving order, somewhere change carriers
From Sunday they start on the train according to the new driving order.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on some tracks, for example between Ústí nad Lab and Kolín, where the place of Czech dragons begins to drive RegioJet.
For most lines only the departure time is adjusted, if any, slightly and their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the rails.
The truck sales started in the winter.
The Czech roads plan to operate on a daily basis in an average of 6783 passenger transport connections, from which 478 remote trains will operate on a daily basis.
Trains will be able to drive about 118 million miles during a new flight.
Roads next to national connections under the new driving order will also drive to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company, together with the new driving order, is setting up dozens of new trains.
The main news will be InterJet trains that will drive on the lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be transported to North Moravia or Western Czech Republic.
The carrier will also traditionally increase the driving price from the next year, on average by 3.2 per cent.
Roads take into account inflation in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the driving order Regiojetu is the entry on the line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The carrier here replaces the Czech Roads after success in the Ministry of Transport competition.
Every day RegioJet on the track will make a total of 16 connections, eight in each direction.
Other changes relate to remote connections between Prague and Brno, which will also be stopped from Sunday at Havlíčków Brod Stations, Žjár nad Sázavu and Kolín.
Leo Express kept his 16 connections, two back connections to Slovakia and also weekend connections to Krakov.
According to spokesperson Emil Sedlarík, the carrier also tried to maintain as much as possible the most similar driving times of its remote trains.
Without major changes, the operation of the trains of Arriva and other carriers should continue.
The carrier shall also be exchanged in certain regional routes.
The changes await travellers, for example in the Czech Republic, where on the trail from Mladé Boleslavi through the Czech Lip to Rumburg will be the place of Czech dears to drive the trains of Trilex German company Die Länderbahn.
Passengers will also be able to use the same train rides in the second year.
As with the Czech Dragons, their price increases by 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Don't we learn the other side's view?
We hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to fight, and died.
In my life, I haven't heard a lesson from the employer's point of view or from a time when no one is defending this, just judging.
No one will tell you in schools that blacks often sold themselves into slavery blacks and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one in school will teach you that colonizers often bought land from Indians, just tell you how brutally we, Europeans, killed each other, but they killed each other a long time ago.
I spent some time in the U.S., right in schools, both in northern schools and in southern schools.
I haven't met someone deliberately shut the fuck up, but I've heard it's happening before, and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it (perhaps there's some WW2 monsters in Japan quite taboo).
My point was that history is not black and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History doesn't care about any feelings, it's just what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without regard for the matter from then on.
On the other hand, we should learn from her and never repeat this again.
By the way, when we're in those southern states, yes, the confederacy flag and the famous slaves there are quite popular, on the other hand, and they have had some good success and I find it absurd to reject them.
In addition, the North was not much better than many people are idealizing it today.
And a lot of people also forget that not all of them in South were slaves and a lot of things were against them.
I wouldn't compare this with Russia, they deliberately ignore some facts, they lie and manipulate, and we don't have to look at them. (YT was a video from the TV where someone started talking about our Legionaries and 1968).
What happened to me at the U.S. schools was the rise in Marxism and idealization of communism, something their country never experienced.
In general, I found that in some universities it was amazing, those students were quite radicalized, and those schools supported them in how many times.
And when I imagine these people going to be a lot older once, I'm a little sick of this being the voice of the majority, because they're among the young and even in the ruling elite.
I find that maybe feminism has long achieved what it had, and it's not about the same thing anymore, it's been radicalized.
At present, as feminists, those who have nothing in common with him and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT, and lead to radicalisation on the other hand, often leading to resistance even in quite reasonable matters.
And the more radical someone is, the more they hear him.
Anyway, I also didn't see anyone judging me as colonialism or slavery.
I've met with the wrong map, but it was both sides :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do myself?
Furthermore, the concept of nationality is generally regarded as unnecessary from the point of view of some personal identity.
If anything with people is so interesting to me, views of the world and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic Fariments, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovenian.
That Slovenian lighthouse is a very nice guy, he's got a theory more than politics, but then he always fucks up some cocotine about coronavir that everyone's ashamed of.
Then, of course, the Church is a Czech Hussite.
Officially they are Protestants, but in fact they were born of Catholic modernity and are actually Catholics without the Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they go to the services of the Hussites because it's theologically similar, but the members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on the street of Botanic.
Otherwise, St. Michael's church in the Dominican square belongs to the Dominicans, and even there every Sunday at 3:00 p.m. they make the Mass in Latin, as it was done before Vatican II.
The flame with Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the Scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – Plaminek blessed in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
They did not go to Vienna this time, but they took her from their Austrian colleagues to the border crossing Reintal – Breclav.
She was picked up at the border last year.
The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in every year, I look forward to it.
It's an honor for me to be elected, she told the current journalists, Amálie Budíková.
While last year the transfer took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly at the border bridge, now at the Rhinetal-Breclav crossing at the parking lot.
Usually for him, but he rides on a train to Vienna.
There's no difference between the platinum and the Czech Republic.
With the Betlémian light, the scotch came from a traditional train first to Brno, where it was handed over to the diocese Bishop Vojtèche Cikrle.
On Saturday, December 18th, the next light dispute will be attended by skiers who will travel by selected fasts and personal trains.
They will take the light from them in local shells or volunteers who will then continue to spread flames throughout the Czech Republic and where the trains do not take them.
Even this year, it must comply with the measures in force against the spread of coronavir.
It's just like last year.
We recommend both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to of course wear gloves, try to follow the breaks, they were at least not to sing, just to behave as safe as possible, describing the speaker's action of the Betlém light Zuzana Hrbkov.
The traditions of the Belgian light that travels to Europe were born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread together with the platinum of the thought of peace, friendship and peace.
The Bethlehem light is for a faithful symbol of hope, the light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, shells and shells have been trying to spread them for more than 30 years.
The action stands on hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of insecurity and human interdependence.
All the updates, including the list of places where people can come for flames, can be found on www.betlemskesvetlo.cz website.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basis of the economy that confirms that the aid is economic cancer, but I don't think that the aid as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education makes good use of the money, even though I do not understand why the money should be put into agriculture, industry and companies as a whole.
As mentioned, it produces an excess product and absorbs the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I work myself in a factory where there are millions of "xy funded/co-financed by the xy project" on foot, and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives jobs to x people, this is the speeding up of development when this company is holding up and buying orders/employees to companies that could grow and be more productive after its loss
Total agreement, it's terrible.
Sometimes the person who was born online also gets caught up in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I think Internet ads don't move with me, but then I realize that they have influenced me - it's just so blurry that you don't always get away with it.
For this reason, I support the radical votes in the European Parliament, which at the moment want to give a complete ban on programming (= targeted) advertising...
It's all bullshit, classical words - I'd ban the Internet.
I have a feeling of this virus has roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe something that most believe and make sense, I am not a sheep, but I will rather believe something that is less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion that I'm going to claim to be a critical thought"
2. "I won't believe everything the media say"
3. "I don't believe in politics"
TV has failed the trend of Christmas movies, their premiere this year has two hundred
Los Angeles – China, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have lost the trend of Christmas movies and this year their premiere shows more than two hundred.
This was calculated by the IMDb film database operator.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years has been pushing and significantly increasing the visibility of the audience, which is why these images are produced as much as possible.
This year it was filmed four times more Christmas movies than in 2011 and twice more than five years ago.
The IMDb database, however, included only those images that have the word Christmas (Christmas) in its name, so there will really be much more Christmas movies.
Films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic there are stories related to this period in particular, worldwide there are popular pictures also at home, Love Heavenly or Classic Christmas Story Life is beautiful from 1946.
The real boom of Christmas images, however, began until 2009, when the special film series came in, the American cable TV station Hallmark reminded the BBC server.
Her advent project called Countdown to Christmas then included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station has begun to launch its Christmas viewers on October 22nd and presents a total of 42 Christmas images.
The Lifetime Competition Station has 35 new Christmas-themed films this year, and they also contribute to a total of their favorite streaming platforms, such as Netflix.
“In this magical period of history it doesn’t matter so much again, it’s important that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it snows,” said Brandon Gray, the author of the book on Christmas movies called I’ll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
"For the spectators it is a form of escape and a way to feel a little calm for at least two hours among all the holiday madness and madness of the world in which we have been living for the last few years," Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark uses the same recipe for his films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there'll be about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding that's going to resolve properly, and the two are going to love each other.
That's how it's all around, and as long as all the movies look alike and have a similar atmosphere, people follow each other, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19, will not interfere with the final F1 race.
At the Great Price Abu Kill in formula 1 will only amount to nineteen riders.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on cod-19 and won't hit the last race of the season.
There's only one formula on the line.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack a better location of the 20th bee that he had left in his qualification.
But the Russian Nikita Mazepin from Haas Station will not finally hit Abu Murder at the Great Price.
He was positively tested for covid-19.
At the start of the race, only nineteen cars will appear, out of the last row will appear on the track of Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher, out of the first Max Verstappen, who will fight with Lewis Hamilton in the direct battle of the title.
Mazepin is said to be a Haas state relatively well and does not show any signs.
Nikita's physically okay because she was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will follow the guidelines of the competent public health authorities, and security will be the ultimate priority for all participating parties," her representatives said for formula1.com.
He can't even run Haas' replacement driver.
A possible replacement would have to complete the qualification or rides on another part of the weekend.
Covid-19 doesn't meet the first racer.
At the beginning of the season just ended he had covid-19 Kimi Räikkonen, last year they were positively tested Sergio Pérez n. Lewis Hamilton.
They can lock you up for this, too.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price of the most precious light is overwhelming!

About the situation in the United States with a leading African-American reporter.
In the United States, new cases of police violence are emerging, this time during attacks on international protests.

The government approved sending up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Women, researchers and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They should help Polish colleagues with the protection of Belarus and the construction of the planned area.
Poland has formally requested the assistance of NATO, in connection with several months of ongoing actions by the Belarusian regime, which calls on the citizens of neighbouring countries in their territory to make a false commitment to the easy crossing of the Union's borders.
British and Estonian soldiers are already active in Polish territory.
The Omicron mutation is spreading south of Moravia?
Hygiene's checking another case for Adam's baby.
“We are currently reporting further suspicions of this option for another child from Adam, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with the previous cases from the U.S. Adamov is not proven," Ciupek said.
Six cases occurred in the country during the week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Flu and Non-Hungary Virus of the State Health Institute in Prague," the director said.
She added that it was two nurses from one workshop at the Faculty of Hospital Brno and two children from one of them, two eleven-year-olds from the U.S. Adams.
There's no connection between Brno and Adam's cases.
Three of them have mild symptoms according to the director, four symptoms-free.
No one suspected of Omikron abroad
None of those people lived abroad, nor did any of their families come into contact with anyone who lived abroad.
The relationship with the waterfield champion is not one of those, Ciupek said.
Pavla Svrčinová’s main hygienist said earlier that an international tournament was being checked in the waterfield, which was in Brno a few weeks ago.
There were also players from the South African Republic and one Belgian player was sick after his return.
California restricts the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas for the prohibition of losses.
The California Governor Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to introduce a ban on the sale and production of certain weapons in the most humane American state by means of a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against the losses carried out after the heart rate of the embryo.
People would then have a claim for damages to anyone who manufactures or sells firearms and firearms manufactured in California.
Newsoma responded to the fifth opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court, which left a Texas ban on losses in force, although it was against an old predicate of almost 50 years, which established the right to land loss throughout the United States about 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the Court did not now decide on the stability of the whole law, but on the technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
In this case, the ban was transferred to the public, which made it impossible for the Texas Republicans to attack it by ordinary judicial procedure.
"I was upset yesterday by the decision of the United States Supreme Court, which allowed the maintenance of the Texas ban on most of the lost services and largely supported the Texas maneuver to protect its law," said the California governor.
"If now States can block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
He has entrusted his subordinates with working with the State Parliament and the Justice Minister for Justice with measures that would enable the public representative to advocate the ban on firearms and so-called spirit weapons.
This is what is referred to as a home-made weapon which does not have serial numbers and which can be used for the handling of regulations.
Newsom wants to have the right to claim at least $10 000 (over 220,000 CZK) and judicial expenses from anyone who would produce, distribute or sell assault rifles, parts of the 'arms of spirits' or plants for their production in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons out of our streets is to create a threat to private complaints, then we should do just that," said the California governor.
According to the AP Agency, after decades of banning the production and sale of certain military-style weapons, California's ban in June but the federal judge here blocked it as anti-constitutional.
If the present State would indeed renew its ban on the use of the Texa template, the words of the liberal members of the Supreme Court of Sonii Sotomayor would be confirmed, which, in an inconsistent opinion on the Friday majority verdict, warned against the extension of the legal mechanism in question to other American States.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant full immunity to the judicial review of the tax ban and allowed the death clinics to continue in complaints against the selected South American agents.
Each emergency assessment has its own public testing phase, when it gradually comes to how the vaccination scheme will look and also to improve the vaccinations itself, based on results.
Perhaps a large-scale study of the effects of 4 doses has already been conducted in Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to five-fold increases in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect.
Just like any other expectation he'll have after the time of his birth scheme, it's just too soon.
Another fact is that a new vaccine should soon be placed on the market, based on an inactivated virus which, according to the manufacturer’s specification, promises up to 10x greater efficacy.

I think O2 is offering the League of Masters, but I don't want to change providers of television and the Internet.
Poland is in danger of stopping payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would object to the law if it exercised new powers and stopped the payment of Poland's money due to the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan on the drawdown of EUR 36 billion from the EU fund for the recovery of the economy affected by the cotton pandemic-19.
And it is under the pressure of the European Parliament to proceed and use a mechanism to receive EU grants to countries violating the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this expulsion by the EU on its own in all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, the head of the small party of Solidarni Polska, whose current government would lose a close majority in Seima.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contribution to the EU.
It would be justifiable in view of the fact that the EU illegally opposes us from the common budget, which we also contribute to, has been given by the Polish minister.
His party in the EU approach takes a more radical position than the ruling party on Law and Justice.
According to the European Commission, changes in Polish justice for Ziobrova's actions threaten its independence and undermine its policy.
Brussels, according to Ziobra, sets out "the impossible conditions because its objective is not a rule of law, but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw faces "a political dictatorship by exorcising and trying to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of an EU based on the partnership of sovereign states, not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucrats who are not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never join such abuses of Brussels, which would limit the sovereignty of Poland.
"We will never agree to Poland's status as a colony," he said.
But to admit it... we in Lidla have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for other things, one yogurt I met again and again, I just needed cheese, parmazan, after ten minutes at dairy regals, and I asked myself.
They had him, it's true, in this narrow sector, all were chosen, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the green and unlactose zone...
If there's no way out, I don't even get into any market anymore, no action, no action, gold cream in the square, they don't have a choice like that, but most of them have everything I need and they're fine, so I'm done in ten minutes.
I'll take my vacation to Lidla.
And I don't care.
For two years I've been following how data is stored here like a hunt, most of the expectation opponents are just a little bit more out of the month than most of the waiters.
A rational discussion at the professional level is taking place, but only extreme opinions are reached in the public space.
Keep going to the wall.
Binary thinking: Expecting will save us, expecting it to be nothing.
To ban everything, to allow everything.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analysis.
Compare apples with strawberries.
This state has it like this and we have it like this.
But that the methodology of data collection is different in those two states, no one can solve it.
Fuj, I'm so relieved.
I'm sorry for your trip and wish you all a nice day.
I was punished with a cook during my childhood.
It was never because of signs, most were just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was angry (read instead of going to sleep, wash with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I've never been punished without warning, Mom always threatened first that if I do it once again, I'll get hurt (sometimes even after another "drumbling" brought only the cook and laid down so I can see her).
Just after I repeatedly refused to listen, I got a few ass wounds (through clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in reasonable execution and measure) is beneficial, because the child reacts much more than words.
I think this part of the warning is important because it gives the child his way of choosing whether or not to listen and get, or if he or she gets better and doesn't get punished.
After all, I had only enough warning to start listening.
System Protection
When a prominent Czech lawyer and Constitutional Judge Vojtěch Cepl in 1999 answered a journalistic question, which is what the Czech Constitution means to him — if a sacred certificate which is sworn and which is not taught at school or otherwise an agreement which may be amended if necessary, he was firmly attached to the first concept.
Once in the Constitution we have agreed on the democratic rules of our life, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and with the changes we are better able to save.
And imagine: Some nations even like their rules.
Just as the Czechs like rabbits and dogs, he voted for the Vojtě Cepl question this time.
In recent times, however, there has been a growing tendency among lawmakers to see the need for changes in the Czech Constitution.
The years have been tested by situations that her creators (in which Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not foresee, for example, by the conduct of the elected president.
But in one thing, Cepl was right.
All we know about such documents is that political intervention in their texts must be thought of.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be a key to manage most of the crises that companies face in the past.
The Constitution is, among other things, a rule of government consisting of the individual rules that govern politicians' maintenance of games.
We fear that too much will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we ban politics.
At the same time, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to have their power.
Covid doesn't choose, in the U.N. Brno fighting for the life of a few months-old baby
Although it is known that coronavirus is a lower incidence for children, there are also serious cases that have been encountered mainly in recent years.
"We know that children are threatened and affected less than adults, they talk about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said the Prime Minister of the Children's Anaesthesia and Resurrection Clinic of the Faculty of Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University Petr Dominik.
The process is much simpler, easier, often without symptoms.
However, there are children patients who are with the coronation of the disease, which we see especially in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need little support.
She's going to be at a clinic for childhood infectious diseases.
Very seriously ill children with coronavir are up to the last time on ARU.
Children with postmenopausal syndrome were in the doctor’s department continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute human pneumonia, that is, pneumonia, which requires a stay on a resurrection bed," he said, adding that this disease involves both adults and adolescents, as well as a few months of babies.
There are also children in severe conditions due to coronation in hospitals.
"At present we have a child of several months and adolescents," said the prime minister.
However, he is pleased that no infant deaths have been recorded in FN Brno in the paediatric hospital.
According to available data, six children between the ages of 0 and 14 died in the PRC on 6 December.
According to Dominica, there is not only a coronavir department in the children's hospital but also an integral part of the cooperation of psychologists.
At the same time, it also points out that both adults and children are expected to slow down the course of the disease and at the same time reduce the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
"That's why we recommend the application of the vaccination dose in children," the doctor added.
In a quiet zone, you can only walk along certain roads.
But those quiet zones aren't that big.
They are seen on the tourist map on maps.cz.
Generally in national parks outside the quiet zone you can walk anywhere (but don't cross the fence in the field).
Lying/driving on wheels in the woods outside the marked roads must not be allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not kept very close outside the national park).
How's the conductor practicing?
Music's in my head. Joseph Kurfirt is laughing.
He was fired by a liberal opera and originally played on a forest corner.
As a singer, he can sing practically every repertoire and as a conductor not only works in the Liberian Theatre F. Šaldy, but perhaps also in the Plzi, in the Theatre of Joseph Kayetán Tyla.
It cooperates with philharmonic, film philharmonic, or sub-circuit symphonic orchestra.
China builds the perception of disease control and that the authoritarian regime is facing a better crisis
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building on the perception of the disease that has been managed and that the authoritarian regime is facing a better crisis.
China has become a health and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was criticizing him for not being able to stop the disease that has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting a zero increase in the infected.
The Czech States, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protection aid and Chinese doctors are very much helping in the fight against coronavir, for example in the worst affected Italy.
How do you feel about Peking's will?
Is this about friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend will meet a friend and say to him, "Don't you want an elephant?"
I got it, and it's great.
The wife likes it because she saves the grass, she washes the car, the kids play with it.
It's just great.
If you want 5000, I'll sell you an elephant.
Dude, I'm gonna cry. It's gonna be great.
After a while they meet, and the guy who bought them complains, "You guys, what did you sell it for an elephant?"?????
It's a dilapidated lawn, it's huge shit everywhere, it's a car, it's a car, it's kids are afraid of it, and the wife wants to get divorced.
What he says is, you're not talking about elephants. You're not selling elephants like that.
World events are ruled by power.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, they are powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can only become such a power if it works for its integration.
It still works at economic and political level (on selected issues), but still lacks military integration.
I personally think that Europe is heading towards federalisation.
It won't be 10 or 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century there'll be different moods and it'll go away.
I've been thinking about it, too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert on honesty, so maybe I'm talking.
All I'm saying is that most of the ellipse consists of 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment on "Spanish oranges and Mandarins", when it is clear that it is both from Spain, which in the case of "Spanish fruits and Mandarins" is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I am based on the fact that the sentence sounds "all the American forces" including their weapons and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
So in other words, I expect that it is already included in this broad concept and there is no need to specify it further among the American forces.
But again, maybe I'm just talking :D
Whether it's like that or not, it's a pointless requirement.
A five-degree earthquake was reported in Tokyo.
Japan's Tokyo metro and the surrounding area hit the earthquake of 5,0 degrees on Sunday.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the monkey cosman Milly
Scary pictures show a moment when the frightened monkey slammed in the toilet before her unconscious owner slammed and laughed at her.
The Dutch monkeys also fed parks, kebabs and burgers, regardless of their actual nutritional needs.
The Magistrate Court in Gwent has now forever banned animal breeding, reported The Sun's journal.
The monkey rehabilitation experts who are looking after Milly said they've never seen such a frightened cosmonaut before.
Milly has spent almost two years rehabilitating with employees of the Monkey World in Dorset and now plays again with another saved monkey name Moon.
A fourfold mother confessed to two charges for causing unnecessary suffering to the protected animal.
In the case of the Magistrate Court in Gwent, she was sentenced to 12 weeks' imprisonment with a conditional deferral for one year.
The Netherlands has also been sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, has been granted a life ban on animal husbandry and has to pay 12 000 crowns of judicial costs.
The leader of the Small Monkeys team, who rehabilitated the trained animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue."
Milly lasted until she got used to people again.
She screamed and hid herself in front of everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she's settled up and satisfied with the male, she can still make new people panic.
The mental scars from the shooting will lead her forever, says Sawyer.
Milly's shooting came out after the police in Gwent found some scary footage in a woman's phone after a raid in her apartment because of a drug charge.
You can hear Milly hollering.
On another video, you can hear Holland monkeys offer cocaine and say, "Do you want cocaine?"
So pour my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) agreed to hold cocaine in order to sell it.
In her home was found cocaine for 1600 pounds (about 50 thousand crowns) hidden in Kinder ovaries.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland was sentenced to 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts will you learn from this passage three times after you jump across the entire 20th century?
Like you're taking the same stuff out of the sixth grade?
And they kill the idea of bifling when no one, often with the exception, doesn't care if you can or understand it.
Write a test for one, and then no one cares.
Go and on the street at random people ask if to manage the character of the roots of the quadratic equation and coefficients.
Everyone's gone through it, and the absolute majority won't even get sloppy and tell you they're all drunk.
So what the fuck is he learning?
I'm a big fan of a general overview and the reality is that people don't want and don't need.
And at that point it's unnecessary, and you'll never get it in them anyway.
It's taught in part for the many people who will need it.
But like, the note that you don't really need all of this on the stand by the machine, I mean, seriously... because you just don't need it.
Plus, we're getting a little slow until we don't know it's a punk mark.
(To which we are likely to share our communist past and reproach against the educators and elites) Of course, the price of being barbarians in these machines is simply high.
If reporters could count, this is probably where the covid never got these dimensions.
Wedding at first sight: War of Kadri and Andrey continues!
Which is the main reason why Switzerland can't leave immediately," answered Andrea on an Instagram in Story on all sorts of questions of curious fans that disappointed her on Kadrim so that she decided to end all contact and even block it on social networks.
Between Kadrim and Andrew, it's been screwing up since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea was moving away from her, at least until she got back to the Czech Republic.
But she totally refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end with love, but it grew into mutual hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! He was disillusioned with Kadri's turn in response to Andre's accusations of lies, gambling and debts.
The alleged honesty of Kadri's ex-wife no longer liked his younger sister Linda.
She decided to stop her brother in public.
Normally I don't even express myself about such things, and we've never said very extra things in our family.
I certainly don't want to cause any regret.
But if I see someone who's trying to hurt the public and spoil the name of someone I love so much, I just don't give it to me!
I'm sorry I have to do it this way, but I'd like to publicly thank my brother Kadrim for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it the most even when we were young.
I'm more sorry if I have to read such false information that are probably quite out of context.
I would very much like to know Kadri as well as I, our close family, stand in recognition in response to the words of Andrey.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and know the truth and know how it really was, added uncertainly.
The drunk thief jumped down the facade to the fifth floor.
You don't believe why.
Cchao started his robbery at the parking lot in the residential district where he tried to get into several cars.
According to the information available, he finally cut off from one vehicle in the calculation of 330 kroner.
Then he didn't think anything better than to sneak out to the 5th floor and enter the apartment with an open window.
He stole two bananas there.
On one security camera, he's then caught walking down the street from the crime scene and eating bananas.
When the owner woke up in the morning, he found out bananas weren't where they were and called the police.
Then Cchaa stopped.
The man admitted that he drank some alcohol on the incriminated day.
And since he needed money, he decided to run away in the drunk.
The whole thing's been under investigation.
The drunk jumped down the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
Pandemic law is time-limited and effective in connection with pandemic preparedness.
If it is cancelled, the law will not be effective.
The law, however, restricts the scope of business
Isn't that enough for you?
The right to gather will be limited, but never cancelled.
In the Saturday elections, four municipalities came to over 60 percent of the voters
New representations were held in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradiška, Lužice in Mostecka, Nova Ves in Liberecka and in Ravna in Pelhřimovska.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen under the law or the number of representatives elected here has fallen.
Of the 28 total, 99 candidates were elected on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69, the youngest of 33.
The preparation of the results of the Saturday elections for us symbolically closes a relatively difficult but successful year.
A total of four new or repeated elections were held in the generalities and, above all, very closely followed elections to the Chamber of Ambassadors, ČSÚ Vice-Chairman Eva Krumpová said.
She recalled that due to the epidemic of covid-19, elections were more difficult for equipment and personal security.
In the Chamber in Uherskogradišk, the Saturday election of the Association of Independent Candidates won 27.76 per cent of the votes and two mandates in the seven-month representativeship.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 per cent of the votes, which also means winning two mandates.
Two seats in the seat were also obtained by the People for the Chamber, and their vote gave them 18.52 percent of the voters.
Once again, they were replaced by the current mayor of the village of Jan Křížkova, who is a member of the Privates.
For one term of office, the Komnyans – independent candidates – were reached.
There were 75.48 percent of eligible volunteers.
In the municipality of Equalna na Pelhřimovska won the Pro Equala Association.
50.50 per cent of votes were obtained, which means four mandates from seven.
Two other representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one of the Association of Independent Candidates 2 have joined the General Representation.
The election attendance was 93.62 percent.
The repeated elections in Lužica at Mosttec once again won the Association of Lužica and Svinčica led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It received 56.73 per cent of the votes and, as in 2018, it has four mandates in the seven-month term.
The second candidate for the Community for the people who voted 43.27 per cent of the voters will thus have three representatives in representation.
There were 76.7 percent of the volunteers in the urns.
Elections in New All at Libereck won independent candidates Hope for New Ves before moving the UN.
For the association of independent candidates, 59.88 per cent of the voters voted and thus won four seats in the seven-month general representativeship.
The UN received 40.12 per cent vote and against the right elections in 2018 strengthened, gained more and has three.
The election attendance was 42.9%.
On Monday, the election results shall be held by the State Electoral Commission.
Then they'll be published in the Law Collection.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know what people write here.
You're just playing stupid to have someone to fight.
If not, it's sad.
I don't claim that Christians are degenerates or anything.
I even like many church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which at last was the goal to look good).
And I don't care who believes in it.
On the other hand, I'm concerned about how many churches had a lot of money in the Middle Ages, how much money they buried, depressed science, etc.
Not all the wars she's caused, for example, the thirties.
Tl;dr: Believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church don't have anything to do together
The man fell his head down 12 meters.
He survived the concrete attack.
An incredible fall survived Sunday night by a man in Ostrava who was affected by the rescuers of the Regional Health Services.
The workers of the Regional Operations Centre took over an hour after Saturday afternoon of the press call with initial information about the fall of men from height.
Two ZZS crews — medical and health personnel — were immediately released.
After arriving at the place, the doctors found that a 17 - year - old man had to fall out of a window about 12 meters high and hit his head on concrete!
In Vitkovice coal was caught.
But not the way it should be, and the firemen went to the action.
At the time of the arrival of rescue teams, a man was unconscious, with numerous injuries and a direct threat to his life.
The visiting doctor intubated his breathing pathways, ensured artificial pulmonary ventilation and, following further measures in the framework of pre-patient emergency care, his ambulance was transferred to another care of the island's traumatological centre, informed the speaker of the ZZS MS country, Lukas Humpl.
More concerns than crownavir I have from inadequate public and public reactions
The spread of coronavir in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but mainly doctors and health personnel are standing.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We're asking military doctor David Rezac.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA experienced a wonderful gala evening full of interesting results.
At the UFC 269 tournament, things were done.
Outsider Julianan Peňová was able to defeat the legendary winner of Amanda Nunes, who had not found the winner for seven years.
Charles Oliveira didn't get caught up in a light bond, he turned against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly smashed Cody Garbrandt's technical KO in the first round.
He also defeated his opponent Sean O'Malley.
A surprise nobody expected.
This brought the women's battle of Bantam weights between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julian Peño.
The American entered into each other's battle as a thoughtless "baby" because Nunes did not lose seven years and brushed his teeth at another triumph.
The beginning of the duel was also carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes began his journey to win a lot of activity and the opponent even spared the push kick she sent to the country.
However, money did not make any further mistakes, and it failed to attempt to attack by hand again.
The second wheel was touching and very tense for MMA fans.
Both rivals were honored by many outstanding strikes and hard strikes.
Plus, Nunes got her on the ground where she started to scratch her.
She had to give up her efforts and pull off the attack.
That's how the American made a huge shock when she became a new champion.
The final night was the battle between Charles Oliveiro and Dustin Poierier.
At first it was better for Poirier, but the card began to turn around.
In the second, he tried to be more active in Oliveira, who tried to catch up with the enemy by hand.
He failed too much, but then he created a great deal of pressure, got his opponent on his back, and he fell asleep in a row of wounds.
That's why he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked shock, which Poirier was a bit upset, but then he had to hang off.
The Brazilian defended the title, Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, the sovereign triumph Sean O'Malley, who had put on Rauliana Paiv in the first round, joined the right back.
Then he received a series of precisely measured hits and scored the fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was able to talk to Cody Garbrandt.
In spring Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little daughter, now after seven years lost.
The bitch or the bitch?
At first glance, it's nothing complicated.
Most of the important names in the Czech language speak only one grammatical family, so it is not a problem for them to determine whether they are male, female or secondary.
Then there is also a relatively large number of important names for which the family is not established.
Such important names are collapsing between two species.
They then acquire two limbs and, in some cases, remain in an inconspicuous form.
For example, the words "sweet" or "sweet" are the family of the male and female, firstly they bend according to the pattern "machine", secondly according to the pattern "song".
For other groups of essential names, different forms are already in the first case of a single number, namely: ‘line/line’, ‘kedluben/kedlubna’ or ‘brambor/brambor’ (in terms of food).
Both forms, however, are written, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may vary regionally, such as "cow" in Czech Republic and "cow" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is unwritten, as are the other Czech-moravian pairs of words: "cow" and "cow", "cow" and "cow" etc.
Some of the words that came into the Czech language from other languages were initially inflexible, but gradually the Czech connotations were taken into account.
A typical example is the term "image", which is a genus of male and female, or the word "bufet", which remained in the middle of the genus unsightly, but in the male but has ends according to the pattern of "city".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
How does the situation look right on the Greek border?
At the Greek-Turkish border, there is tension over the growing number of migrants who are trying to get further to Europe.
Thousands of people began publishing at the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians promise support to Greece, humanitarian aid will also come from the Czech government.
What exactly motivates refugees to take the wrong course?
And what does the situation look like right here?
Three months we haven't seen the blue sky and we've been breathing, a reporter from Sydney describes
The destructive fires that Australia has been facing in the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and left millions of hectares of land.
How do the dark authorities and the people themselves deal with the funeral?
Could the Prime Minister Morrison's government do more to prevent the drastic effects of criticism?
And what will the country have to prepare for the future in relation to climate change?
Lenka Cabrhel is talking to a reporter from Sydney Iko Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why it's always written about everyone everywhere.
For people it is unpleasant to solve what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so try to negotiate.
I don't personally know anyone who was falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've experienced how people often treat their environment or even the police.
Victims should always believe.
The trend has become that the victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
It's still a lot of people leave it to themselves.
Yes, they will find those who falsely accuse someone.
It's a blow and spit in the face with all the victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the charge is meant" and that it's "trend" you're only helping sexual rapists.
Czechs flood scattered houses, families have no money to finish
Building material prices in recent weeks and months have risen by more than 30 percent.
A number of people got into a state of fluctuation.
It does not have the means to complete extended family homes, and the banks refuse to raise mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the cost of construction works is also increased.
That's why people don't have enough money to finish up already scattered family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to raise mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In a better case, people move to scattered and uninhabited homes.
In a worse case, scattered houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and pay rent for it," says the economist BHS Štěpán Kreeček.
In a year, we build two or three family houses, and at 50 percent, it happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult to keep certain things contractually, even if the material has been betrayed.
So we do without profit," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Sliven.
A lot of people are just going to have financial problems.
If they calculated that the building of the house would amount to five million, it's going to be seven.
I think some will wait," Sliven added.
The material has caused the most damage to the iron, iron and also to the installation and heating equipment.
Construction companies, however, are also fighting the lack of workforce.
In the Czech Republic, there is a lack of graduates in the construction sector and the presence of foreign workers slows down the pandemic.
It is more favourable at this time only to the situation regarding the issue of building permits.
"The construction authorities issued 7 675 building permits in October, which is almost 10% more than a year ago," Kreček said.
We're fine and we'll get even better.
Real vision but missing, comments ČRO – mujRozhlas
In addition to classical celebrations, entry into the new year has been traditionally carried out by politics.
This year they spoke to the nation in addition to the Prime Minister and the president of the UN Andreje Babiš and the Christmas message of President Milos Zeman and the president of the Senate and the Chamber of Ambassadors.
What do we learn from the principle?
As I get a great degree in this, I've got my own theme I've chosen, I've got a bakery, I've always been working on it for a year, and then I'll write a written part in two weeks.
The states are completely at peace with us, unless a man is a total macaque and something is left in his head, then the commission won't be too much of abstinence on the theory.
I may have been studying at the state school for a week, and when I was at the end, the commission always tried to lead me to some logical drive that I immediately liked and I had it right.
Otherwise, I know people who pay someone to do the semi-annual project (we did it many times, really beneficial, many learn) and then only learn the project and have it extended.
I think it's great when, at the end of the subject, there's a test that shows the knowledge gained within the project, not just defense.
All right, but don't pay e-mails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be just as smart as they are.
Those people at the embassy don't have to have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can safely build a similar pot of Putin next to the bear's juice.
You should give her another way to match Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, though, that Insta throws the artists under his feet.
As soon as you don't give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your achievements will be reduced to a complete minimum.
In addition, the furt changes what is more important for the function, whether the lake, comment or storage.
I've been really scared lately, so maybe I'll have to cut myself to the point where many artists from my industry are successful and they're not almost allowed to do it.
Finally, maybe I'd be happy if there was something user hotter that didn't drive artists out of all the creativity and energy
Declaration by the Parties working on the Donbase
The link – yes, the breakup – no, they express their opinion on the image of the resistance to the breakup of the SSSR.
Thirty years from the illegal break-in of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in human history occurred.
On 8 December 1991, Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šusčević signed the agreement that “The SSR bond as an international entity and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist” in Belarus.
With one handful of feathers, they "destroyed" a vast country with nearly three million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens were displaced abroad.
From the beginning of the 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by between ten million and eleven million.
Even in spite of the loss of the Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars together!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed what was built in the past 70 years at a meeting in the White Ages betrayed a socialist camp (created by the price of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Civil War).
They have, of course, deindustrialised, de-industrialised agriculture, depleted fourteen republics from the greatest power in the world, which had previously been economically linked in the only mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the deterioration of the population, economic breakdown, science, armies, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in post-world space, the series of orange revolutions, NATO's expansion to the east, the war and the desolation of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all the result of geopolitical capitulation, the first surrender of the Socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a notion of polytology as "vacuum force".
Everything that has been quickly wounded and given up has quickly been filled and obtained by NATO countries that have accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And today the whole world is shaken mainly by the events of the late 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
The price of the product sold in the supermarket with a large turnover does not have to correspond directly to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that is worth 189 Kč / kg.
I'll buy it by putting it in the fridge and making it out of it on Thursday evening.
In the alternative reality, in which I don't buy the meat on Monday, it will be delivered to 99 Kč / kg on Tuesday - write me a mechanism by which the change in the price of it will become a competition for my living system?
And either I wait until Thursday and this meat will be reduced to 69 Kč / kg 1 day before the consumption date - what would this meat be different from what I bought on Monday at 120 Kč expensive and left it 3 days in my refrigerator?
I'll answer it myself - nothing.
These assholes about that if something's cheap, it must be guaranteed bad, infected or unquality are terribly retarded to tell you the truth;-)
Now I've just gone to Brno to the head and in the basement, the missus has given me some brochures, similar things I've always taken to help the brigades, they can't throw it out...
Well, the brochure was full of village sense and conservative views of the world's functioning, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I realized it would be some kind of an agitation.
After reading, I found someone who published it and finally came out of it.
Well, like it was a good mother, full of completely unnecessary lessons, like I'm supposed to wash and not be a pussy.
The damage of the paper would not have caused any damage.
I've had something similar with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychiatric manipulation and emotional exaggeration make you make this person heal because you like him without realizing how much in the p*part of the situation is.
She threatened me several times because I went with a friend she didn't like to fuck out.
Or even when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she cried and begged me not to go anywhere.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
Cca year it was a great relationship, but then he ran another half year and started kicking her on the doll.
Then I ended the relationship with saying that I'm going out and lying to her, but we can talk about it next week to calm her down and not catch some ammo again.
Such a person makes you feel, emotion, and total joy.
I'd rather stay back.
When the insurance companies are stolen by buying dark tests and hunting for positive ones who wouldn't even know about the terrible disease.
The only thing we achieve is the complexity of companies, carriers and others, because their employees in the random number generator have been in prison for five days.
In the West, they've already stopped with the hooker and admitted that he has no value in dealing with the disease less than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, the War is new, and there's something else to steal and drive the ego by thinking about fussing.
I can see that we're back with a good old shirt.
After a few years of waste and oppression of this unscrupulous business, MLM recruiting returns to the show.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, champion of the U.S.), the initial promises of product training and business skills quickly turned into "this doesn't have to interest you, especially getting people."
I was very interested in the products I was offering, because I wanted to help people, but training was more about how to scare and stab.
When the first money came, one quickly realized that if he wanted to make it, he had to sew several certain products each month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only one that made a person feel like a subterfuge seller.
But what I can say is that experience was valuable, one learned not to jump on every tip and check the information carefully.
At the same time, I wouldn't have thrown all of them into one bullet.
People in this business are successful and even people are successful, but they will certainly not be praised with expensive consumer goods or a "real" account.
In the corporation where I work, I haven't experienced a lot of things like that.
The HR is calm, the managers look at their management, and they don't get us into anything.
So regular evaluation is kind of happening, in the form that this is going on with us (set some goals for next year, let's see what happened and what doesn't) - it's more self-esteem than someone would value you according to some numbers, and so on.
The firm's actions are also not mandatory.
But we're a little bit out of business, too. There's a department that's more "corporative."
Sometimes a person feels like we're such a short-startup that he's squashing in the offices of a big corporation.
But it doesn't really poison us until the results.
The Czech missing in Britain is after death.
Her body was found in London.
Nearly ten days ago, British police were looking for a missing 32-year-old Czech who was missing at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced in the Jakob Kulhánek demise on social networks that a woman from Uherskoradiška had been found dead.
Unfortunately, this afternoon the British police confirmed to our London Deputy Office that she had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not disclose more information in this case.
A sincere condolence, he posted on Twitter Kulhánek.
A young woman was last seen on the bus on November 28 when she was on her way to work, and she was supposed to pick up money from the ATM before she got back.
Her disappearances were reported by workmates five days later.
After that, the London police began patrolling her, and Interpol put her in the wrong place around the world.
Even missing persons were found in the Czech database.
The police in this regard had already detained one man a few days ago.
What he had to do in the case and what he suspected, but she didn't.
At the end of the year in four municipalities, new representations were granted
On Saturday 11 December in the municipalities of Komňa na Uherskohradiška, Lužice na Mostecka, Nova Ves na Liberecka and Ravna na Pelhřimovska, there were new alternates.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen under the law or the number of representatives elected here has fallen.
At 28 new elections, 99 valid candidates were elected.
Electoral participation reached 62,41 %.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Evna, where 93.62% of eligible volunteers were elected.
The mandate received a total of 8 women and 20 men.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest is 33.
A total of 13 candidates were registered for new elections to the seats in the four municipalities.
There were 36 women and 63 men in 28 posts.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The preparation of the results of the Saturday elections for us symbolically closes a relatively difficult but successful year.
There were four new or repeated elections in the generalities and, above all, very closely followed elections to the Constable.
However, most of us had to work under more stringent epidemiological conditions, which put greater demands on equipment and personal security, Eva Krumpov, 1st Vice-Chairman of the Czech Statistical Office, assessed.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday December 12th at 03:49 p.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission and published after approval in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
To deal with the fact that we've got a very dangerous infectious disease here at the very beginning, it took me a while, but it didn't work out.
To deal with how idiotic a large part of the population is being put to it on all its layers, I have a problem with it so far.
I'm looking forward to it (morning!) because it finally makes me less dependent on the fact that other people aren't shit.
He'd be relieved of the president's role and the ability to reinstate it.
It's a chance that this is really going to happen, but it's like the others here mention a lot of small ones.
Besides, I'm not sure if the corporeals could even be considered a fortune.
The Grand Duchy is an act that threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity or the democratic character of the state.
It must have been more serious.
How pandemic affected intimate life: Increased number of people up to 35 years who are without sex all year
The more young adults in the United States live their lives without sex.
This is mainly about religious-based people, the DailyMail web site.
The study showed that between 2008 and 2021, the proportion of young people who claim to be sexually active rose from 8 percent to 21 percent.
A woman between the ages of 18 and 35 who said she had no sex in the last year is more than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, as shown by the study of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them may be the economic impact of the coronary pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
However, the presence of media, social networks or video games that make young people less and less priority could also contribute.
"From 2010 onwards, the share of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 has been growing rapidly, indicating that they did not have sex in the previous year," said research worker IFS Lyman Stone.
In marriage, sexual activity is more frequent, and in 2021 only 5% of them indicated that they had no sex in the last year.
Stone added that marriage under 35 is only a small percentage.
Then, too, the fear of premarriage and religious establishment contributes to the loss of sexual activity.
Although there is a higher likelihood of sexual activity among husbands, the percentage of married and married children aged 35 is still declining.
Young people share an opinion on pre-marriage sex, about 30% think it's a bad thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
"It is true that among the free individuals in this age group there are minorities, but their behaviour is detracting from this trend," Stone says about these thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarriage, it is a reason for religious foundation.
Since 2008, the rate of abstinence has increased from 20 to nearly 60 % in the case of free people under 35 years of age who attend religious meetings more than once a month.
Among the "less believers" the trend rose from 10 to 20%," Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and mainly social alcohol drinking during pandemic times.
The study also showed that sex is less likely for people without work or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which is likely to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, making this need "inflate".
This trend was mainly caught behind the lockdown during the pandemic of coronavir.
The whole order of vaccination against covid is whether the company should bring part of the population to behavior that they do not want but that can save their lives.
This is a relatively difficult question that I am particularly interested in the issue of social consciousness.
For example, if we don't order them and they die, it's our fault.
My argument is that for the death of an 80-year-old who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well, heard some misinformation, and, as a result, couldn't see it and finally caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think that we can die of a strong opposition of expectation, which on the side of the SPD and the KSCH is complaining about a state of harassment and totalitarianism.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clear that most unaccompanied pensioners are probably part of the second group, so they will actually be able to do it on their own.
Czech without snow.
How does the mild winter get signed in the fight against drought?
This year's winter has brought one of the smallest snowflakes in the Czech Republic in recent times.
Ski areas operators will not be allowed to operate without technical snow; weather is also complicated by the preparation of the cycling Jizera 50s.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I should have a story, but it's not about a pancake.
Once on high school, our teacher led us across the city on the boat so that we could get a project on ships across the river.
We walked there once in such a wide street and we don't see anyone in the middle - the stupendence of the Hare Krišna sect.
Of course they fell asleep on us.
Luckily, I ran away, but with one friend, they got into a conversation.
When she left, we asked her and her teacher what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she replied.
All of us, including teachers, we've been laughing all the way to the ship.
We're awfully disappointed.
Not so much happens, but the system is already playing, says Orosović
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after his previous visits to Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where Prime Minister Mateusz Morawieck welcomed her with military courtesy.
"We are opening up a new chapter of mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the conference.
Scholz stressed that Europe must jointly declare that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis, caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops at Ukraine's borders, according to the Chancellor, is agreed to deal with the use of diplomatic negotiations, including in the framework of the "Norman group", which includes France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki stated that the Chancellor informed the situation at the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko has artificially triggered a migration crisis and uses people like live targets and weapons, because every night we record a hundred attempts at (illegal) crossing the border.
He discussed with the Chancellor other sanctions so that Lukashenko's regime and his patrons in Kremlin finally understood that we were determined to prevent the EU's eastern border.
Scholz, according to the DPA agency, assured Warsaw that in a dispute with Belarus, he enjoyed German support and condemned the inhuman treatment of Lukashenko's regime with fugitives.
The drunk Polish mine blamed the accident, tried to hide it.
The car came back after a while, but the car was driving another jeep who was trying to take the blame.
When the police informed her that even if she was not able to take advantage of the ride and catch an accident, she was able to get a driver's license, she came out with the truth, said TVN24.
She admitted that she had another nun in the car who asked her for help.
Then the cops came for Sister Celestine.
She was subjected to breathing tests, and after they found out that she had two mistakes in her blood, they immediately obtained her driver's license.
At the same time, she was informed that her actions would be brought before the court.
Dog Hugo does what he can.
Yuri Shimovich, but he didn't mind his movie.
The Czech family comedians were watching American dog fairy tales.
But they forgot about the essential thing: the legality of the film.
After the curly film F. Brabce Gump - dog that taught people to live, now we're watching a show about the spectacular emotion in the cinemas.
The co-author of the script and director in one person Juraj Šajmovic ml. is free to follow his previous film Here I have been watching since 2012.
On the stage, the speaking antagonist Hugo and some famous characters around him are coming back.
Julie and Ivan, the owner of the forest pension, who's moving, and so they start calling him a doggie, Julian's father with a partner and her daughter Veronica.
She's not a little girl anymore, she's a teenage girl who has first love.
The director and partner Beatriz Šajmović (which is also a producer of the film) were confronted with the reporting processes already in the previous dog video, but there they played at least children and dogs.
This time she wrote the creative two even weaker script that causes a mixture of awe and feelings of shame.
Let's get this straight.
Julie, although a scientist, is in distress over the child's dark mistakes and if the correct "constellation" comes, he is digging with his forest engineer Ivan, wherever the co-ordinator determines – on the chapel of the car or church tower (of course during an excursion with the local guide), the meritorious Colonel Mojmir, despite the flying training of shooting his own daughter in the woods (Julia), who falls into a coma, where the family is taken away from the hospital to play a miraculous process of dog healing in the heart of the forest alone.
Nothing against the clean treatment of nature and the strength of pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
The viewer, however, is amazed by the contents of the canvas filled with incredible situations, and the figure was needed for this message.
Two thieves from staff, doggie competition, forest charlatan, policemen coming to the event to look for "drugs" and discussing herbs about the succulent strength of bone marrow – and which the family in the pension is obviously drunk.
When a hero comes out after a heavy comet and comes up sitting naked and dressed with a cigarette at the family table and requires his father's whiskey and flakes to cure a vegetarian, he can't laugh.
On top of that, viewers will explain that “it sometimes happens at a comet. ”
Sheimovic's team lacks basic dramatic knowledge of text work, the ability to display wear situations, feelings for character and point and directional management.
The sheer performances are unbalanced, a piece of adviceless and the overall impression is inflamed.
Whatever Lukas Vulík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová are trying to get their parties up, they don't have much to play.
The only bet of the film remains the poetic pictures of the forested nature of the cameraman Vladimir Holomk and the twins of the estuaries.
It is not enough to plan a number of characters, a chattel puzzle and dog reports, so the more human vulgar expressions that characters allow.
The argument is not even the summer membership of the Club of Deer Farmers - as in the case of the producer.
For good intentions to promote nature and friendship, a person with a dog must also be knowledge of crafts if a person wants to tell a credible story.
That didn't happen in this case.
There's a little bit of eroticity and a little bit of sense for the genre.
Even as an ad on cannabis therapy, this amateur-oriented piece wouldn't have gone through.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant assignments just from fools like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, here's how you fucking understand that, but that's just because you never tried.
The decision is always on the customer, if he doesn't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you had listened to these kids, you might have changed your mind.
It's a job like everyone else, in which case the brigade for the benefit.
The Middle East suffers from unusually dry months.
Winter, however, is the only time in the year when it rains.
"The strike of complete absence of strikes during November, as we noted at some stations, is unusual," Israel's meteorological service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi, in northern Israel, reports only six percent of the long - term strike average in November.
So this week's rain was more than an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't been a long time.
It is also the right Christmas scene, the native of Nazareth, was delighted.
The outbreaks in Israel come only in the winter months, are aggressive and irregular.
In the winter rains there are dependent forests.
Without them they beg and are prone to fire.
It's not just about forests, it's also about drinking water supplies and an inflaming for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, was filled this year in spring with the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has fallen.
Water managers have warned against drought a long time ago.
"It is expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, there can be a shock," said an Israeli Water Agency spokesman for the Uri Schor.
Israel can help with such technologies as waste water disposal or recycling.
Worse are economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria or Jordan.
In the streets of the main city of Jordan, Amman, there are tanker cars.
Water and private colds are drying.
"This year I received orders of between seventy and eighty percent compared to the two previous years," Imád Sulejman, the driver of the tanker's car, said in September.
In Iran's Isfahan, clashes between farmers and security forces broke out.
The reason for the protests was dry.
The Koryto local rivers felt completely waterless.
The region has the driest November in many years.
Israel prepares a military attack against Iran
Israel's Defence Minister declared that the Vienna conference did not bring "no progress" and informed Washington about preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facility.
Minister Benny Gantz announced on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for a military attack against Iran, Jonathan Lis informs.
Gantz, who lives in the United States, is trying to convince the Americans to release their pressure on Iran, but he also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear conference in Vienna did not bring "no progress" and the world powers "understand that Iranians are playing with them".
About three years ago, this happened to me.
I'm going to have a little bit of a little bit of a barbecue when I'm talking to find out what she wants me to do.
Finally, I found out that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these fakes, so I'm gonna have to ask you a little bit more questions and questions and finally thank you and leave.
Please tell me I was in danger, but the pyramid is a pyramid and the financial advisors are financial advisers.
The skiers went up on the weekend, waited for them enough snow and good weather.
The mountain centre in Czech Republic experienced the first major ski effort this weekend.
After an excellent snowfall at the end of the working week, snow is not an emergency and some skiers have started operating.
The host has not failed to fulfil the obligation to prove himself in the case of trains with a certificate of origin.
While tractors do not complain about customers’ interests, some ski equipment loaners report lower demand for their services than before the epidemic.
In the run-up, thousands of people in the Liberian country were said to be on the weekend.
The lasers wanted the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied that the start-up weekend has really come from Friday evening skiing, when we had the first ski at the top of the mountain," said Jakub Hanush, the director of the Sports Area.
Hundreds of people expressed their appreciation for the first weekend skiing in the new season as well as to the Jessenics.
For example, ski arena Karlov or centre in Branná na Schumperska was opened.
The weekend visit was very decent, and on Saturday and today 400 people were expected.
The conditions are favourable.
Today the sun was shining, it was about minus three degrees, so perfect, he didn't examine the famous representative of the ski resort in Branné Rostislav Proházka.
Skieral operators may sell skipas only to people who are infected or are within the period following the processing of the disease of covid-19.
When people are prepared for the exceptions and prove themselves necessary documents, ČTK René Hrones from the Ski Centre of Špindler's Mlýn said.
"We only recorded incident units," he added.
Less interest than before the pandemic is reported by some ski equipment lending and sales.
It's the loan interest of a lucky skier.
It's not like last year, but it's still a lot of customers, said Alexandra Bokish from the Opava shop Skiopava.
More effort is expected during ski courses.
Snowbearr David Shinták also feels that it is not about lending ski equipment as much as it used to be.
This time before the pandemic, we were almost disbursed.
In contrast to the period before the pandemic, we're about 50 percent, says ČTK Shinták.
According to him, people with pandemics were injured and taught to sit at home.
On the contrary, a large demand is recorded by a loan in the Novako area on God’s Daru.
With the loan of the skis there began a week ago, and the interested ones must now order them.
"We are beginning to borrow the balls this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a great deal of interest, just like last year," said the operator of the Pavlín Novaková area.
The interest is comparable to the period prior to the epidemic, according to it, is also about a ski school.
If we want the successful and wealthy not to go abroad, there must be an opportunity to live a quality life as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to get a dentist or a doctor.
There's wise men and women who don't have any property abroad.
The owner of the company abroad is not going to leave.
I agree with the rest.
If these people don't live well in the Czech Republic and if these people don't see a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they won't live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began in such a way that one beautiful day Orbán won, ruled the year, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It's naive to think that the Czech can't feel in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is the choice.
If he's gonna live here, he can win some traditional V4 nut.
The young and educated will leave, remain his supporters and the people whose property is not put into the plane.
That's a scary picture!
Longmayer in the blood for a beer bet?
While in the Czech Republic he was in full-flowing autumn, in Thailand the staff of the film Island in front of Jiře Langmajere (55) enjoyed tropical weather!
However, on social networks, the actor published a bloodthirsty photo of his face.
Is it a real injury, or is it an act?
The London police are still looking for unannounced Czechs.
She was last watched on the way home.
"The disappearance of Peter does not like her behaviour at all and we are beginning to be very concerned about her," said Lucy O'Connor from the police department in the neighborhood of Lambeth, where she worked.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very concerned about her and briefly wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman said on Sunday 28 November about 19:45 left work and moved home to the quarter of Camberwell.
She was reportedly watched on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by one of her associates.
According to the British media, the heart functioned as a "assistant of nurses" in the Children's Hospital Evelyn London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Hospital's Guy's and St Thomas'.
"We have immense concerns about our dear colleague, Petru, who is not aware of it," a group of health facilities said in a twitter contribution.
"We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that could help her find to contact the police," the communication continued.
The public also calls on MEP Harriet Harman, who pointed out the case of Srcova at the press conference on Saturday.
"She's been unconscious for a few days, she's only 32 years, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandable to the death of the establishment," the laborist politician said, holding in her hand a photograph of a woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her because she was outside her home country, away from her family and worked here for our health," Harman said.
The police had already held a man in custody in connection with the case.
According to the BBC report website, however, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what he was suspected of.
Russia is unable to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTGs (i.e. about 5 divisions).
That's not how I underestimate Ukraine.
It's not a huge amount, it's about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are raising the threat of invasion and beginning to have our entrance with full teeth.
I've been feeling up there.
I don't know why you decided Russia wanted the war.
The war is a hell of a fun and Russia has HDP Italy.
Comparing the situation in 38 is beyond so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare that to the first Punish War and the "annex" Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not comply with the agreements from Minsk, Russia is investigating those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's how the "concentration" on the borders would fit.
Ono, I'm a servant.
Since Sunday, new driving rules will apply, mainly to suburban connections
Passengers in the Prague Integrated Transport (PID) are waiting for several changes from Sunday, which relate in particular to suburban connections.
New lines emerged, some changed the route, and others disappeared.
Mladoboleslavska is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the main city from Sunday stop the fasts from Czech Budějovic in the Zagradní City station.
In the suburban train, the S7 trains will leave, which will pass through the Prague main station on the route from Berun to the Czech Ship.
In the recently run Prague-Zaradní City station, the R17 will again stop fast from the Czech Budějovic and Benešova.
The PID is now expanding to other areas.
Among other things, bus rides to the Sętlé nad Sázavou, Blatna at Jeseneca, the Old Splavos and Turnova.
Buses to Mladoboleslavska will be included, including lines with crossing to the Liberian and Královéradek region.
When integration is completed, 77 lines will be removed, 37 new lines will be introduced and 12 operating lines will be adjusted.
From Prague, Zličina will launch a new 405 bus line that will go to Jatce.
The new direct connection of Prague – Kralovice to Rakovník, which replaces the cancelled S53 train line, was also established.
They will be sent to the early peak and on the weekend connections from Prague to Rakovník, when an express line number 404 will be released.
Newly included are lines 400 and 410 driving to Liberia.
They're leaving the Střížkov metro station, not from the Nadraží Holesovice station.
The 400 line runs through Mölník, Dubo and Czech Lip to New Bor and the selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 goes through Mölník and Dubo to Doks, Mimona and Jablonno in the Company.
On the contrary, a new operation is cancelled or limited on dozens of central local roads, including Mochova, Dobříše or Rožmitál under Tremšin.
All trains with departure from Prague are cancelled at 02:30.
Due to the modernisation of the railways, long-term restrictions continue on the Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Lab and around Kolina.
Changes are waiting for passengers in other places as well.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or extend the line of 420 from Dobříš with the port of Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets to Milevska.
The routes 540 to 543 in Nymburg have been changed and the routes of some buses are adjusted at the border of central Czech and Horovicka in the Plzeň region.
Healthy dinner/eating to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I'm doing classic 9-5 with a 30-min break and my only option where to get food is to go next to Billy or a bit further to Lidla.
Since I don't have any movement, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietetic as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, and I'll buy as fast as possible a pizza on the ground and a yogurt and an apple.
Question: What healthy without the need for heat adjustment would you recommend me buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately they are.
And it's not about the trees you need to see.
Only a tip of a tree can be hidden under the snow.
If destroyed, the tree may be more prone to foot-and-mouth disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason we're not allowed to drive outside the cabins, but it's one of them.
Dary's confession of the relationship with the Negeb: I didn't enjoy this at all.
The Czech show businessman since Friday is nothing but revealing the relationship of Dary Rollins and Paul Nedwed.
They've been pulling it together for years, the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
The gift now sent to the fans a comprehensive message explaining why love is a long half secret in front of them.
"I allow myself to say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or in Slovakia who would have avoided that Dara had caught a bear, i.e. sorry, a Nedwig," says Dara Rollins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
I think he packed it, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are in the public interest, they have no joy from it.
And it's here.
What we both didn't enjoy, but we knew that one day it was going to happen, the singer continued.
I just don't know who's up there.
If those who don't care about it and jump on it from the can, or we whose lives are under discussion.
It's like if one of you wants to hear an opinion about whether you're dating your husband or girlfriend enough, or you've been insisting that everyone really know the list of your former partners and have been informed of your mistakes and mistakes.
It's a juju, you want it, it's fine, Dar.
The two went together in Italy, where Rollins drove for the preparation of his new fashion collection.
The bear's been acting as vice president of the Juventus football club for a long time.
They went out with the truth until now, because they were waiting for the end of the widow's divorce.
Ivan and his wife have been separated for three years, but they're not their own for just three weeks.
Anyway, those who are happy with us and want to thank us.
We are just people, we have families, children, the past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we have both hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband, and just like him with me, I'm standing with him.
Hey, the other commentators probably already said everything important, I'm just confirming that colleges are great at first, my associates with most of the first semester or two they met and they've come to know and they've come to work together, and then we're going to find ourselves together, which is going to be my best option, because you know who you're going to live with.
The apartments don't most of the time go too far, so now you probably won't find too much, but looking at the offer certainly won't hurt.
Otherwise, not only Ceylu will be avoided, but also the surrounding areas (the streets such as Vranovska, French etc., that's a pretty bad address), and some parts of the Jews are a little ghetto.
In contrast, the district of Veveří is very student, the King's field and in this direction it's nice, and it's close to most of the faculty VUT (I don't know exactly where you're going).
So I've never been renting, but I'm a cousin of Brnák, so maybe I can talk to Brn as if you're missing some more information :)
But that's an example of completely normal thinking.
Because of what several doctors have decided to do in Poland, it is really okay that the state does not finance enough some schools.
Whether they learn what they want and pay for it from their own people or whether they go according to the state and pay for it.
However, we cannot let a private actor control the part of the school simply because a few crowns will come to a full state contribution and will thus be able to teach in schools what he wants.
Such a claim is somewhat weightless when it is written by a person who, two days earlier, said so about the petition action for the boycott of the totalitarian state:
So the vote against it if anyone goes to waste is the same as the vote against you for some statue to stand on the spot?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the man who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I've already experienced in cataloging/digitalization that (and even for a long time professional) it's either kind of a good thing from the eye, or they're writing something like xxx *** or... (according to the convention) and noting that it's unreadable.
The truth is, in this case it's quite legible, so I probably wouldn't recommend it.
Personally, I'd sort this out in some way, depending on what program you're using.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look into some of the leading databases and find the closest.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd like to point out that the author or the printer simply created his own sign that sits at what's physically on that coin.
PS: Isn't this by chance more of an Easter kingdom (kingdom) than OdyNská?
PSS: Someone's already let you down.
Look at this comment with FILE
Politicians don't even know what our presidency's "theme" will be.
That's a lot worse than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve of something because no one understood a text is funny.
All the important approved documents are examined word by word, and no basic knowledge of English is enough, that is the case of lawyers.
In various EU institutions, hundreds of translators and translators work, English with politicians is more suitable for informal contacts, links to over-standard relationships.
In addition, it is quite interesting with the English language, after the UK has been released from the EU.
I don't understand the hat on Cel.
I've been working there for the third year and I'm fine.
How many times do I drive from work at 10 o'clock and never have a problem.
The fact that it's a ghetto can only be said by someone who hasn't nearly stepped into life.
Yeah, most of the Roma people live there, but the only thing they do is stop them from walking and parking where they don't have:D is definitely not that I'd be afraid to go out there tonight.
So if you're looking for a relatively cheap accommodation with good access to the center, I'd go quietly.
The houses are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slovene (78) without a father and a lover of Gelem as a bullet in the plate!
Who's spending Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people on the adventurous wedding lighted their first candle, not Felix the Slovak.
I don't have an advent pen, so there's nothing to fire.
For days I saw the bride, and Lucie must have one too, said the bright saxophonist, who so confirmed Patras's words that she often visited her.
He visits, but he doesn't live in their house in Vinohradech, where Dada stayed alone after his departure.
The dictionary still doesn't know where she'll be on St.
We recently met with Anick, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: ZASE SPOLUL!
Felix Slovak and Lucie Gelemová: ZASE SPOLU!
But we were still talking about something, so it didn't come to Christmas.
I really don't know where I'm going.
I buy gifts all the time, and I'm sure I'll buy Dad and Lucy something, maybe perfume.
I'm a gentleman, he added Felix, who himself came to the cross of a music video at Richman's club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I'll always find someone I like to talk to, says the Slovak who was happy to meet the wife of Man Saturday Adrian or the singer of Kamil Nivlt.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland so we can afford to have no soldiers and no weapons?
I doubt someone's gonna defend us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor must be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why it's supposed to be a bad argument, so you'll explain it to me?
I don't know any other ingredient that could be planted in hospitals in crisis.
The police are few and they can't afford it, so firemen and nowhere else is the high percentage of people who are trained in health at this level.
And the fact that our army is able to prevent Ostrava just goes to the head of previous government, not the army, she's been asking for new toys for a long time.
Record dry in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
Czech Republic has been going through the worst dry season in recent years.
The waters are said to have been drowned in mountain and sub-mountain areas, the smaller peaks of precipitation are also recorded in places where there has been no need for moisture so far.
The reason for the drought in most of Central Europe is climate change.
However, the impact also increases the way in which we operate the land.
What do I prepare myself for?
And how can we help nature in times of distress?
Yeah, it's gonna be like this, I can't stand in my ankles on the ice, I know what a hockey game is, and the tactic (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a total holouse.
And whether you're a hockey team "Russia Bears" or "Lama China" you lose two goals, even if you don't have to win the game at all costs, it's different than when it's compared.
But just as I listen to the Czech comments that they're making, what decision-makers don't notice, whether it's a male or a female hockey, it's all weird, but it's probably all sports, UEFA and "Italian players" or motor sports F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And if it were the opposite, it would be like always, and that the Czech Republic and Russia had lost more often than they won, it would probably be classic "they lost" all "MY we have won".
Koronavirus: The number of diseases in Russia exceeds 10 million
On Saturday, 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
There are 5766 people hospitalized.
In total, 34 451 people died, another 74.
Cases confirmed in the last 14 days are 100 000 in the Czech Republic in 1967, 871 100 000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million Sunday.
In the last 24 hours 29,929 new diseases have been reported.
It's the lowest daily number since 13 October.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, it's the lowest daily number of deaths since the end of October.
Britain is facing a "unavoidable" large wave of infection caused by Omicron, said on Sunday on Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the British Health Office.
He'll need new quarantine measures.
People infected with micron have already been hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their number to grow.
So far, no one has died on the micron, but hospitalization occurs about fourteen days after the infection and about three weeks after the infection.
The head of the British Labourers Keir Starmer observed on Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently violated the law by setting up a Christmas Eve at Downing Street last December, when he was introduced to lockdown and banned.
One of Johnson's government ministers assumed that the quiz was "virtual" through the computer.
However, he participated in the Downing Street group of employees gathered around the computers.
In Britain, pressure to remove Johnson from the Prime Minister's office is increasing.
During last December, when a heavy lockdown was introduced in London and a Christmas party was banned, the ministers arranged Johnson's wedding party despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media are screaming that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of ITV commercial television for Britain: Two years ago Boris Johnson won a high majority in general elections.
This morning the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the prime minister's office.
It's remarkable how fast things have developed.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting a spring of elections that can end the twelve-year-old government of Viktor Orbán.
It will be elections of European importance.
How can you expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They're probably not even free because there weren't even the last two elections under Orbán.
His party Fidesz controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to benefit from it, and makes other smaller or larger tricks.
So far, the last one sounds like everybody can actually choose where they want.
This will allow Fidesa to bring voters from determined districts to those where the result is irrelevant and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying that they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
The situation is very different.
It was a matter of time before, not if Fides won, but how much and whether he would have a majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will get united opposition.
That's for Victor Orbán and his side is a big habit.
Won't they try to keep playing much harder?
Yes, we have some signs that they're ready to go beyond what they've done so far.
She has recently avoided the record of the President of Parliament's independent media and one of Fidesz László Kövér's leaders, where secret service leaders claim that the opposition is a threat to national security.
These are the signs of the new approach you're talking about?
Yeah, that's one of those papers.
It's all starting with the language.
I was pretty beat quite often, last in 14, my mom's parents don't have much patience, neither do I, her dad has a long time, but then she's going to smell extremely (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I've been a lot of hellish, and I've grown as a little scary, to the point that I was lying on the ground in a cricket and I was all blue, which took me about 2x under the shower to calm down.
Sometimes they danced to me as an educator, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
Now I'm definitely also tending to deal with things with violence, like I'm a little bit of a washing machine, now for kicking at least something, and as a young parent, I'm so crying through the hand of the thing (not to get too much through the hold), so I never get anything extreme, but I always need it.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it's my explosiveness, but it's probably that education has its share.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose patience with my children, and I'm going to do the same.
I think that being a child is just wrong and that my parents didn't have to do it, especially not when it was no longer "educational," but because of frustration, on the other hand, if every parent just shits, it's probably not possible for their children to stop at least a little, so I don't tell them.
I don't know why the O.P. should be ashamed of something.
The laws should be clear and clear.
I would therefore call the Kundami those who make laws of such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're not afraid of a revenue accident?
It can really be calculated by people wanting and buying the product and you'll have what mortgage to pay?
Cat's oblivion world.
Where does Slovakia move the process with the killers of the Kuciak journalists?
In Slovakia, the main census begins in the process with four accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martiny Kušnír.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partners changed Slovakia.
She moved to a civil society, but she also discovered the practices of the accused businessman Marian Kočer and his connection to the points of Slovenian politics and justice.
How will the fundamental breach be the process for Slovakia?
This is what the press can do.
How is it possible that this petition had more regular media attention than the counterpetitions of the deacons of all medical colleges that came out of the day two days later?
By the way, they got worried and the company gave up.
She died on Czech television with the covid half a year ago.
The next government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of warehouses nowhere
Minister Karl Havlíčka's proposal needs to be recast in principle
The government of Prime Minister Andreje Babiš is at the end and the law to ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorisation of the deep storage site of highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government interrupted the discussion of a proposal submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade by the government after the air traffic flows.
However, its content is in serious opposition not only to the affected villages in the Platform against the Deep Storage, but also to the Svez City and the municipality of the Czech Republic.
The authorities of the law expect to strengthen their capacity to decide on the depositary, which is promised to the caretakers since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which requires the Czech Atomic Law and the European Directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its Coalition Treaty, to recast its proposal in cooperation with the foreigners.
The proposal of the law by Minister Karl Havlíčka, who has the Platform available, concerns the municipality in particular: The proposed degree of involvement of the municipalities and the public in the decision-making process for the storage site is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens.
It can be effectively effective only if the municipality or the public can influence whether the process will continue in the locality at all.
This may be ensured by the deposit of the depositary's obligation to request prior to the initiation of a specific procedure of the consent of the municipalities concerned.
The proposed substantive proposal almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the public virtually only statistics in the opening proceedings.
In the proposal, there is a lack of system-setting compensation for the municipality for the entire search and selection process for storage, authorisation and operation of the site.
The representatives of the municipalities are not really able to defend the interests of their citizens in the search for a place to store.
However, only in certain authorisation procedures may they give their comments or withdraw, the authority or minister in whose interest the authorisation is issued shall decide.
The action shall not have a secondary effect on the conduct of research or construction works.
The co-decision of the self-governments requested by the Platform is usually used in many democratically mature countries and definitely in those where they have already progressed in the approval of the repository, such as in Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is, in addition to the failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices for the preparation of legislation.
In this case, it is the contract with Havel & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and which relates to contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánk.
According to the contract register, the total amount for this work shall be approximately 4 million kroner.
Antonín Sekinčka, mayor of Ceyle from the locality of Hrádek and spokesperson Platforms against the deep depositary said: After the ministers of industry, who compared the position of self-government to state authorities when searching for a deep deposit of highly radioactive waste, we are waiting for a more significant turnout from the new government.
We're offering it with a hand.
We are also grateful for the support of the Alliance of Cities and Towns, which considers the problem of the lack of the rights of the municipalities in such a basic building as that of the municipality directly concerned in the selected locations.
The Platform against a Deep Depositary combines 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 companies) with a view to requesting a change in the State's access to spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not only be confined to a Deep Depositary.
The platform further seeks that the choice of the location for storage be conditional upon the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Heart John Goodman (69) caused the loss of fear: Shodil 90 kg.
Although he had no need for anything to change in his life - style for years, his doctors finally scared him.
They told him that if he doesn't forget, he'll die.
And that's what it took.
Goodman gradually weighed 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He praised his new position in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
There's a whole different person from Roseanne's sitcom!
John liked to joke that his friends and family asked him to lose weight because his large body caused the breakup of the furniture.
"I ran everything into my mouth," the actor said in the 2018 AARP interview.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I get to the age that I can't afford to sit in the spot anymore, he said to ABC Goodman, whose change is amazing.
It also matters what boss and what you want to use the word "boss."
If it's any text on the platform that's expecting players from the gaming environment, I wouldn't be over it at all.
If it was a formal text and a high school text, I'd probably look for a way to describe or explain the bosses.
There are more kinds of bosses for everything.
Maybe the game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses that yes, and so "boss" is something like a master / ruler given level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games are hiding bosses (super boss, hidden boss), who don't even need to beat to finish the game or level, but often are even stronger than standard bosses.
Then they need half-Life games where the bosses are, but the player doesn't run directly with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and they're called anyway?
Well, then they're mini bosses.
It gradually translates somehow the boss simply does not go, the Czech and no other languages does not sort of solve it (it is interesting that only the Catalan who translates the boss as the ultimate opponent).
It is a short story or game of general importance, computer controlled, opponent stronger than all previous and monitoring completion of some level or task.
After missing Peter from London, he's been seeing the whole world.
She joined the Czech police.
After Peter Heart's missing, the British police have been patrolling since December 3.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
This 32-year-old woman from Uherkoradiška has been looking for since December 7.
At the same time, Interpol is helping the British police.
Czech Peter Srnco saw her colleagues last November 28th.
The British police have been after her since December 3.
Interpol gave her a so-called yellow circular.
So after Peter, he's been seeing the whole world.
"The Czech police closely cooperates with the British police," said police spokesman Katerín Randlová.

The reported search for Peter has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, she is thin and has brown eyes and long hair of the same color.
She should come from Uherskogradišk.
Peter worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues worry about her, such disappearance is very unusual for her
Even the dark Mrs Harriet Harman was involved in the search for Peter.
She joined in lifting the planes with Peter's face.

But it's not clear who it is and what it was with Peter.
Pre-Failure Czech Republic is terrorizing Agent Tesla.
While the data in October showed a slight decrease in attacks, last month with the next year's attack significantly increased.
A large campaign in connection with Agent Tesla was recorded on 18 November.
The attacks are targeted against the Czech Republic.
The strategy of attackers remains the same for the time being.
The infected e-mail Annex shall raise the user’s attention to the name referring to payments and financial transactions.
While last month had a dangerous annex on behalf of the invoice word, this time it was marked as a copy of the account repair for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal of Eset.
Spyware contains functions that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex email clients.
The harmful code actively searches for stored login data that subsequently sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic in the fall of August and September and with the coming holidays and at the end of the year the attackers' activities are growing again.
In November he remained active and spyware Formbook.
Unlike Agent Tesla, attackers in this case do not focus specifically on the Czech Republic and security specialists in November captured more campaigns with global reach.
Compared to the October data, Formbook in November slightly weakened, but still stands for almost five of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
Formbook contained the most common annex with the .exe plugin that bore the name REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
But the name of the account is still revealed.
The annex in Czech may then be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
A significant decrease and decommissioning of activities is seen by security analysts at the Fareit program, which stood at 1.6 percent of the attacks and in the Czech Republic for the last few months had no major campaign.
That smart lady today who doesn't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated fools.
The Prague cause was bigger than the media reported.
According to the survey of the coast and my experience of demonstrators, I'm not afraid to estimate about 10,000 people.
The people in the river filled the bridge and the bridge and the opposite coast communication.
That means people really are a lot.
In addition, some 4,000 demonstrators are spontaneously added to the unknown amount of roundabouts.
I'm saying there's something new born here, says Radek Wekry.
The constant dissatisfaction of several large groups or groups of people led to their finding a common language.
It's just the anti-seriouss, the anti-seriouss, and the sex. They wouldn't be able to fill in or pay.
The action of the Chcípl dog company has rising popularity, it reminds me of the Million moment for the democracy of the border.
Sometimes I feel like they're renting the same stage and technique.
It's hard to say what kind of movement this dissatisfaction might have caused, not only depends on the move of money, but also on whether a three-dose vaccine from Pfizer will not be four and more doses.
It's definitely not going to be left-and-middle movement, so bet.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, because it is clear that we will have to let ourselves be overcrowded every half year.
I'm so glad the vaccines saved us.
The brilliant action of scientists who are proud of mankind's right.
