Go get ready to go to bed.
It's not a weapon.
This coat is covered with skin.

Speaking French is a big party.
Did you actually try?
Hey.
These are Tom's dogs.
I'll give it to you for free.
You better not go.
This year the spring is late.
If you don't speak English, the probability of taking a good position is much smaller.
You haven't given me as much rest as you need.

I think that should be expected.
This book is in French.
I have to go now.

When did you start studying French?
I'll come to you.
No one else offered to help.
Take your coat.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I'll make you happy.
Let's play something.
What are your goals?
If we just stop trying to be happy, we'd have a good time.

We're not in a hurry.
She's more shy than social.

Where are we going?
I think we need to know where Tom is.

What else is in your pocket?
There was no other place to go.
The man's blowing her away.
One hug of yours will make me happy.
I can't believe you still trust Tom.
Please forgive me.
We waited with a weak expectation.

What does it mean to come in time if everyone else is late?
The wind blow was breathing directly in my face.
I want eternal life.
Are you sure you want to hear it?
I think you'll be satisfied.

Don't even try to come.
Both are unpredictable and impatient.
So am I.

What are we doing here?
The object is outside the direction of this investigation.
You sat in my place.
You're absolutely right.
You're impossible.
Tom said you'd come.
You need to be careful.
I think we're gonna need Tom's help.
What did you like?
It's gonna be okay.

How are you today?
I'm really interested.

Hold the rocket.
Going home, I saw it again.
Her hair is long.
I put it in your room.

I'd like to find an account.
I heard you talking.
We became friends right away.

Your black one's leaving.
You know everything about me.
Let me think for a second and I'll get in touch with you.
They're interesting people.
Please call me from time to time.

She found work as a mechanic.
Leave it to me.
They lied to you.

Her sweater is purple.
Now that I've registered, what am I supposed to do?
Clearly, Americans can't even solve their own problems, so how do they imagine they're able to deal with the problems of the rest of the world?
Speak clearly so they can hear you all.
I have a gondola.
From now on, I'm going to study French more seriously.
Do you have any other questions?
It was awfully cold yesterday.
I forgot to give him the message.
I finished American literature in college.
Fuck, I forgot my camera!
We've been out of our mind for a while.
I think you'll be happy.
Teenagers have left.
I wish I was rich.
I just started.
If you need anything, just call.
Don't forget it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
I've learned a lot.
She bought a toy for the kid.
I was wondering if my e-mail had come to you at all.
She'd cut her hair in front of the mirror.

His teaching method is good and bad.
I heard Tom's version of what happened.
Everything I want is you.
I'm looking for a small suitcase.
He witnessed the murder.
I'm flying to Boston tomorrow.
He made it clear that there was nothing to do with the matter.
I love the party.

Excuse me, how many are these?
Please do it again.
That's what I think.
Many museums don't work Monday.
They took Tom to the hospital to wash his stomach because he ate something poisoned.
Don't make me do it.
You've been sitting in my place.
God forbid!
Your green one's leaving.
I bet you know French.
For dinner, Tom took Mary to a beach restaurant.
You don't have to pay for the apartment in advance.
Let's play tennis this afternoon.
No matter how old you are, you can always learn.
Do you live in Sasayama?
Everything Tom said would have been a lie to me.
What's the time tomorrow?
Are there any children?
Don't open those windows.
I always enjoy listening to you sing.
Can you come tomorrow?
The killer could have been stopped.
Don't you think all our politicians are too old?
There's no way to hide this fact from her.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
Some say that French is one of the most beautiful languages in the world.
I like to take pictures.
I'll pay you.
Do you have a car?
Do you love French wine?
You have to keep your promises.
Tom was sitting on a dinner.
The girls danced in the living room.
She's convinced her son is still alive.
Do you have any books in French?
I finally stopped in front of the old house and saw the city again.
You won't see anything without a flashlight.
My dad's a little old-fashioned.
I laughed at his joke.
Your answer is correct.
She wrote a letter.
There are many ways to do one thing.
Anyway, where's Tom?
I have to admit, I'm lying.
We've been using this insecticide for two years.
Come help me.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
My sister lives near Yokohama.
Oh, very bad!
The bus arrived empty.
We need to keep helping Tom.
My mother's got a nice word.
What day are you usually free?
Tom decided to postpone the council.
Tom stuck his shirt and then put your tie on.
It's very cold today, isn't it?
You won't be able to help us.
She's popular, but not because she's beautiful, but because she's good at everyone.
Ken plays football every day.
Say it again any time.
I don't want tea. I want coffee.
The lawyers and the car mechanics are the people I trust the least.

Can you eat raw strawberries?
What prevents you from working?
Who's the manager?
What are you asking?
I was convicted.
The train passed 500 miles an hour.
She gave me this compact disc.
The director considered the possibility of firing Tom, but decided not to.
I have to take it off.

I'll eat it here.
Tom has two children.
The police don't have to take bribes.

That's what I said.
You're lying, aren't you?

Don't look in the box.
You're running.
I heard the phone call.
That's why I can't believe it.
He was angry that nobody said anything.
Tom is the only student in our class who can speak French.
I'm sorry I messed up your plans.
I'll ask you to translate this report into French.
Nobody's wrong.
Everybody jumped.
Many traders were robbed during the riots.
Why do I have to study French?
She's not tall.
It's true!
We're grateful for your help.
Since we've been wearing clothes, we don't know each other.
Let's start.
He visited his uncle yesterday.
Tom's lower than average growth.
I found the keys.
I know this is important.
My aunt, who lives in Tokyo, sent me a beautiful blouse.
It's delicious.
You have a lot of friends who are worried about you.
I don't have any prayers.
Naita Tom, I don't know him that well.
Now I'll tell you the truth.
You're drunk.
That's partly true.
He's been living here for the last ten years.
I have socks, but I don't have shoes.
Shit.
She's calling me Kenji.
I have the information you requested.
In a mysterious way, sense of humor is related to national qualities.

I'll see you.
Sometimes I wanted to become an astrophysicist.
Tom's got blood back.
This camera is Tom's.
I'm sick.
I really appreciate your help.
I bought a red necklace.
You want me to cut it a little bit?
It's a book.
I have to do everything Tom tells me to do.
You can do it. Come on, I'm with you.
Did Mike stop drinking?
Aren't you glad to see me?
I really wouldn't have done it without you.
I'm not mad at you. I'm just very disappointed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
With my younger sister at the same time, did you leave?
The match was delayed for a while.
His brother learns a lot.
Ken has arrived in Kyoto.
Did you see Tom?
I wish I was taller.
Do many people visit a museum?
The thieves robbed the museum.
He's crazy about you.
He's coming inside to speak French.
Tom helped Mary put on her coat.
That book for cowboys could be expensive.
I'm sorry.
Is this your book?
I've always wanted to learn French.
Do you want to call Tom, or do you want me to?
Don't be afraid of Tom.
He leaned on his elbows.
What's the minimum wage in England?
Maybe we should tell Tom he's opposed.
What's the minimum wage in New Zealand?
I'm shopping with him for the price.
You can speak French, right?
My father smokes rarely.
His empty attempts to seduce her showed him that the address was wrong; she was the mother of two boys.
I lost him.
She made the doll for me.
What's in the bottle?
I heard everything you just said.
We're related souls.
The boss is very upset.
That doesn't change anything.
I have a meeting with him at lunch.
The invitation said there would be popcorn and non-alcoholic drinks.
Tom looks pale.
I hope this helps.
What did you find?
I think we should get out of here.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.
He's much older than Ken.
Where are the souls?
Mike's running very fast yesterday.
Do you have a European Health Insurance Card?
None of the balls are yellow.
I know a man you need to meet.
I was rude.
Kuala Lumpur is worth a visit.
I couldn't get them to understand me.
Do you speak French too?
I started studying French very soon, so I'm not very good.
These gloves belong to Tom.
Where's the entrance?
Tom's trying to get an answer from Mary.
One boy, not more than five years old, asked Tom how to get to the post office.
Tom still lives with his parents.
Sometimes we meet them.
I think Tom's asleep.
Are these explosives?
If you don't want to be alone, I can make you a company.
Ann doesn't have sisters.
Tom has little hands.
He arrived two days earlier.
Was it a good trip?

Men make houses, women - houses.
Where's the bathroom?

If I were you, I would have applied for this job.
The patient was written from the hospital.
My Internet connection is slow.
We have to keep working.
Hurry up, we're gonna be late.
How long do you have to wait?
I'm smarter than you.
I was fascinated by her opera song.
You'll find him.
Don't fall in love with me.
Who's with Tom now?
His concert was very good.
There's another number of tourists.
The door's shut and closed.
I'm hungry!
It's easy to talk to Tom.
The twins look exactly like their brothers.
Don't mess with Tom.
I didn't understand the smile.
Bass hunts that you know it.
It's cold.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
Keep your mouth shut.
Would you say that again if you loved it?
How much money do you have?
Oh, I was sick.
I've got a lot of bad news.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
Given how long I've been learning French, I should be able to talk about it better.
Let me introduce you to Tom.
I have to admit, I'm a little nervous.
You want to buy some rice?
I think you have the right not to let Tom go.
Tom accepted an invitation to visit Mary's feast.
You're not the only one there.
I heard what they said.
This story ends happily.
I'm angry with myself.
It's done by Tom alone.
You won't believe what people throw away.
I stopped smoking for a year.
You don't carry much luggage when you travel.
I got Tom's picture here.
I didn't tell you everything.
They're both working.
Tom's not welcome here.
You accused her of lying to him.
There's no point in fooling around. You know she's playing games with you.
George is very excited about his new job.
It was fun.
He gave his camera to his friend.
He must be given an advantage in front of the others.
I moved you.
Take it with you.
Wait a minute.
I swim once a week.
I waited half an hour.
He's been playing with me in public.
The crucible burned.
Tom worked very hard.
How much money do you need?
Oh, I was sick.
We're in position.
Cut it out.
How about we have dinner together?
I think you lied to me.
That's amazing.
Where's the bus terminal?
If it wasn't for me, Tom wouldn't be here.
That's the picture I took on Tom's house.
That's not our problem.
I've never spoken French to Tom.
We all took it for granted that Tom could speak French.
Tom's back inside.
Who's Tom talking to?
I'd like to learn more about the museums.
This shirt needs to be washed.
You won't believe it.
I'm looking for a house.
I'm not feeling well.
Why are you early?
He decided to go abroad.
I'm not accusing you.
I'm a night bird.
I'm glad you think so.
Mary looks like her mother.
You're in agreement with Tom, aren't you?
Do what you want, but I'll stop him if I can.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
I need to trust Tom.
I'm thinking about learning how to swim on vacation.
Where's the beach?
Are Jaints playing tonight?
I feel like he won't let me get away with it so easily.
It'll be 5:30 in a minute.
The school starts at eight and a half.
Tom's bathing.
The beach is not far from here.
Ken jumped over the wall.
The upper part of the mountain is covered with snow.
One hug of yours will make me happy.
When are you leaving?
I'm right behind him.
My best friend is a book.
Right by the beach there's a really good restaurant that I think you'd like.
What made you think so?
I'm coming.
He missed the last train.
I looked at the picture.
You had no choice but to wait for her.
I totally erased you from my memory.
I haven't said no yet.
It's not that deep.
I'm not a patient.
You mean French?
I've never seen you so nervous.
What's the minimum wage in Lithuania?
Here's the hospital I was born in.

By the way, have you been talking to him lately?
Sentenced to death.
I want to talk to you about something else.
Tom can't speak French, can he?
I don't have anything.
At least one time she's thinking with her head.
I thought you might be hungry.
This is the beginning of the new era.
I have to put my shoes on.
I've been thinking about it all the time.
Don't you have anything else?
I think you're amazing.
Why don't you get up?
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I finally won his heart.
We should have obeyed their request.
Pick the one you like.
We'll know soon enough.
You look tired, so lie down early.
That was really stupid.
We'll be together soon.
I don't have anything to offer.
I'm talking to my French employees.
That's my sister's picture.
Tom's having a hard time dealing with people like Mary.
I've tried them all.
He gave her a piece of advice.
The room was so relaxed that I could hardly breathe.
Mary and Jane are cousins.
He certainly loves you.
I lost my wife last year.
Looks like she doesn't feel well.
Did Spot go too?
I promise I'll bring him back.
I have relatives in Boston.
Get out of here!
Tom's wearing a slipper.
Don't look at me!
Don't be disappointed.
I need to go talk to Tom.
How about we study together in the library?
I have a job to do.
The proposal for work is still in force.
Your shirt is missing a button.
I need to get out of here for a while.
Your green one's leaving.
Press your fingers.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Can I see this one?
Uncle gave me this watch.
The true friendship is forever.
Tom's used to working on the open.
Tom pushed the trigger.
Tom and Mary are drunk.
Did you play tennis yesterday?
You're kidding!
Let's go back.
I'm getting on the bus.
Tom teaches French every day.
In this shop, they're dealing with kitchen utensils.
I think you made the right choice.
Tom didn't respond right away.
You're expected to do a good job.
How old is your son?
The girl who works in that bakery is nice.
Please, buy me another cup of coffee.
Alice might come.
How do you do that?
I had a good time.
I'll stay till the next day.
I don't like artificial flowers.
It's not my fault.
Does any of your team speak French?
Looks like there's gonna be snow.
I've never seen such a thing.
Come here as soon as you can.
I've never climbed to the top of Fuji.
You're not playing golf, are you?
Tom doesn't work anymore.
It probably doesn't matter.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Tom's jumping.
What's the minimum wage in France?
I forgot her name.
This political problem has led to heated debates.
Eat on a live frog every morning and throughout the rest of the day nothing worse will happen to you.
Tom won't be happy to see you.
The unemployment is rising.
I couldn't wait last night.
Russia loses 20 million people during World War II.
I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
Nancy's smiling.
If you're going to France, you have to stop French.
I understand what you're saying.
I never trusted Tom.
We're learning French at school.
That's what he said.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Do it now.
I can't tell you what happened.
I think you should give up.
Please be patient.
Your joke's getting too far.
I had a really good time today.
Christopher Columbus drank unfiltered sea water.
I want to be a French teacher.
I'm glad I don't need that.
Everyone's hungry.
The Japanese have black eyes.
Tom's a professional baseball player.
Tom wanted to be unchaste.
I have three children.
Let me sleep for another ten minutes.
Uncle gave me the watch.
All horses are animals, but not all animals are horses.
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
I ate pizza every day last week.
I promise to bring him back.
I sent Tom home.
Do you have any gum?
I guess you're wrong.
His daughter became a beautiful woman.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Fill it in.
Tom's on his desk. He writes something.
Do you want some coffee?
I'll call you about Tom.
I opened my check.
He was here at the time.
I put on my shoes right now.
He felt uncomfortable in his father's presence.
Your shoes are untied.
Tom shouldn't be here.
He took off his coat.
I can swim in the river.
Do you do French every day?
Don't raise that much noise, please.
You're pretty good in French, aren't you?
I'm extremely busy.
No one considered his words important.
That's a strange problem.
I don't understand that.
Where do you live?
I didn't know what to do.
It's time to eat.
I'm so happy you came.
I haven't made a mistake yet.
Tom got six.
I did it for you.
I've seen you somewhere.
They'll play basketball after school.
Those clothes are good for you.
I couldn't give up.
That's a surprise.
I heard someone come in.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Did they take the bus to the museum?
I need to discuss something personal with you.
He was transported to the hospital with a helicopter.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary was missing.
It's your shirt.
Are you coming?
Don't interrupt me!
I played with Tony yesterday.
Jill's married to Jack.
I wish you luck.
He was home alone.

We're gonna need Tom's help.
How tall is your brother?
Come and see us.
Will you tell me something about yourself?

It was a perfect day.
I haven't had a shower in three days.

Are you sure you want to know?
I accept your offer.
What's the minimum wage in Romania?
Brian left the door open.
Tom, wake up.
How are you going to get home?
I wash my clothes.
I heard French is a difficult language.
I haven't completely fed myself.
You'll stop thinking about her soon.
Let me take a look.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom works for a big company.
Say hello to your friends.
Let's ask.
Get up and lie down.
Come on, touch him.
That's my job.
Don't touch the ball on the door.
How many years did you learn French?
Carol came back to her hotel.
Do you like that color?
Please be brief.
I haven't seen him yet.
The mountain is covered with snow.
Let's get out of here.
Fuck, I forgot my camera!
He's off the train.
Mary's dating with two at the same time.
There's no mention of Tom yet.
Give it to me.
Did you manage to finish everything you wanted?
You'll have to wait and see.
I was woken up at five o'clock.
I was afraid I might be late.
Tom says he can contact the dead.
Can you stay?
What do you want?
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Don't talk to me now.
What do you want to tell me?
I'm looking for something not so expensive.
It's much easier for Tom to speak English than for French.
I think you'll be surprised.
Next time, I'll make more efforts.
I'm done with my job.
He's a hero.
I don't have any demands.
Her charm is a mixture of joy and goodness.
I should have listened to you.
I've got bones.
I'll meet you at the park.
I've never won before.
He's a little out.
I like that color.
My grandmother was operated in Germany.
I think you should buy this.
I saw you and Tom.
I don't think it's true.
I have three cameras.
Ask them to call Tom.
We're all sorry about Tom.
I hope I have a chance to return your favor.
Tom interrupted the hammer to see if there was any chemical that could be used.
This requires careful discussion.
Tom won't believe it.
I have to learn the truth.
I think you should meet Tom.
We ran after the cat.
I'll go if Tom goes.
I wish I was young.
Be more precise.
Tom's French is really pretty good.
Isn't the weather great?
I don't like that.
I don't want to belong to the elite at all.
I saw you on TV.
You have to learn hard.
I'll be back soon.
Ask Tom yourself.
Tom, explain the details.
Don't let Tom get away with it.
He was playing football with an empty can.
I think you'd really like it.
Just close your eyes.
I'm on vacation this week.
My French teacher is my age.
You better put your sweater under your jacket.
Are you sure you don't want to ask Tom for help?
The new production process achieves good results.
Then his ignorance is understood.
You're absolutely right.
Everyone knows his name.
My French isn't good at all.
I would never hurt them.
Are they criminals?
Can you get six out of ten?
I'm too busy to help him.
You can see her in the morning.
Have fun.
We'll set him a farewell party.
Which club do you belong to?
He may have been sick.
Tom doesn't get on the bus.
Some books are worth reading over and over again.
We're working together now.
Go back to your place.
He finished Cambridge with a distinction.
I have to get her back tonight.
I need to start getting ready.
Did Tom teach French at school?
What shoes are you wearing?
We've certainly done our best.
I'll postpone my trip to Scotland until it's warmed up.
He started justifying himself.
How old are you?
It's okay.
Where did it happen?
Why is he hiding under the table?
Don't make me do it.
How big are your kids?
I'll stay until tomorrow.
Please call the doctor!
I think Tom can share your feelings.
I gave up.
You and half don't know.
That's the picture I took at Tom's house.
She gave him something to eat herself.
I'm starving!
I'll help you get better at this.
My father goes running every morning.
I saw Tom walk down the beach.
My brother became an engineer.
How much money do you want?
Don't get up too fast.
She gave up all her dolls.
I didn't say anything.
What are you gonna do?
I really appreciate it.
I knew you'd be busy.
Come on.
It's a big city.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
Kim's dressed very attractive.
Don't ask me for money.
Tom hates school.
There's no problem creating a website. Just be careful not to violate someone's copyright.
Tom protected his wife.
She's got a beautiful letter.
The fingers of your hand are five: thumb, index, middle finger, unnamed and poor.
The foil is made of polyethylene.
I've solved the problem with the light.
Did anyone notice that?
She's a little shy.
Are you sure you don't want me to call Tom?
You're young, but I'm very old.
I haven't started yet.
Up and down how much does a cab come out of there?
You both look very young.
You're absolutely right.
Is that yours, Tom?
I don't have much English books.
We have until tomorrow morning.
I like your shirt.
Enthusiast began his dignified start.
I saw you on TV.
We went to the museum.
Who cares about me?
At first, his local cowboys laughed.
He looks like he's in a hole.
I think you should come see him.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
Be more precise.
I'm off this week.
You're wearing your socks.
I promise not to do that anymore.
I just gave blood.
He doesn't know French or German.
I'm not a traitor.
Are you sure you don't want to keep her?
I don't doubt his honesty.
Please open the package.
I'm pulling.
I have no idea who he is.
Would you tell me your name if you loved it?
These kinds of mistakes are inevitable.
I don't speak French at all.
Do you see the game?
This is your home.
The losses were heavy for both sides.
I'll follow your instructions.
He told us a lie.
God gives me happiness.
I want something warm to drink.
Tom tried to convince Mary that it was time for them to leave.
She sneezes every morning.
Don't forget the party tonight.
Would you like to speak in French?
Uh, that's cool.
Don't make me look nice.
I don't have any money.
Honey's eating bread.
I have other plans for Tom.
I couldn't do this without you.
Tom wasn't used to living in town.
Keep an eye on Tom.
Jane's out shopping.
This cake is nice.
I told Tom why I couldn't go.
The long fields are demo now.
He's doing very well with the kids.
Come in, please.
We were really having fun.
Tom hates this.
It's true she's dead.
Don't get used to it.
Finally, it stopped raining snow and the weather got warmed up.
She wasn't doing anything that she wanted for Christmas.
The students didn't remember what they read in this book.
I study French every day.
I've heard every word.
Where'd you get your socks?
Let's go to the movies.
Looks like Tom decided to stay.
Tom won't give up.
Some poisons used properly are useful.
What are we going to eat?
Keep him a secret.
You make me feel so guilty.
I'm mad at you.
Let's do it.
She gave me permission to use her dictionary.
He's three years older than she is.
Don't hope so.
What's the price of this umbrella?
Mom, will you give me the toilet paper?
How'd it go?
I think you'll find him.
I was expecting you last night.
Looks like you've changed the whole room.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tom showed Mary several effective ways to learn French.
I'm not good with sports.
The judge sentenced him to death.
That tall man is Mr. Smith.
That was pretty good.
I really didn't expect Tom to make it.
I found out he's a genius at chemistry.
It can't be like you're walking around here and you're starting to abuse people's addresses.
I had a date at 2:30, but I fell into a trap and couldn't get there in time.
They went to the sea museum.
Tom makes a lot of effort to improve his French.
It's been wasted a lot of time.
They didn't talk.
I didn't call you a fool.
I'm being spoken in French today.
Will you tell me what to do?
Are you sure you don't want me to buy you a ticket?
They're not that bad.
I'm careful.
Don't take it inside.
We're all connected.
One word of support when you fail is worth more than an hour of praise when you have succeeded.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
It was over.
His rice was soaked with sauce.
Tom found Mary's story interesting.
Mary Tom won't get any help.
You won't be protected anywhere.
She was wearing a leather coat.
I promise I won't do it again.
I made the Ann doll.
What have you done, Tom?
I thought you'd be tired.
The story is very interesting to me.
I read this book.
That was a good year for you.
He was clean.
I can't do this.
I'm a French teacher.
I want to buy Tom a present.
One thing is certain, no one can stop me!
She can speak French.
He's a friendly man.
I was convicted.
Tom was told very soon that he had cancer.
Tom got home by bus.
For me, a meeting in the afternoon is a better option.
What do you have to do?
Tom studied French three hours last night.
Raise your hand.
What's this?
It was too easy.
I travel often.
Here's the hospital I was born in.
I've never loved biology.
I owe you so much for your goodness.
Let's split the prize fifty to fifty.
Hold my hand.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tell me about Tom.
I think it's better to go to bed.
I haven't seen Tom since his birthday.
I need to know.
Do you like to travel?
Your plan has failed.
Tom had a big party in his house while his parents were on vacation.
I was forced to leave school.
I'm just done with the breakfast.
I have to go help Tom.
It happened once.
How long are you gonna have to wait?
Tom's the man who told me when the meeting was gonna be.
I appreciate your cooperation.
Soldiers started coming home.
I need your help.
Let's get on the bus.
Are you coming or not?
Tom didn't want Mary to play with his kids.
I forgot to tell him.
Nancy looks so tired.
I really appreciate the offer.
Don't talk about people behind their back.
She's grown up.
Come with me for a walk.
I'd love to see a movie.
Whoever's well prepared doesn't care.
It was fun watching TV yesterday.
Do you have a hobby, Tom?
These are the trees on whose list the compressed bugs live.
Who speaks French better, Tom or Mary?
I've got some news for Tom.
Are you sure Tom's behind all this?
Please don't let that happen again.
You put me in pain.
I've tried everything I know.
Why are people afraid of her?
He's been fighting the hepatitis for six months, but it looks like he's just started to recover.
The universe is a mystery.
I'm back in Boston.
Where's your father?
How much is the bill?
A man came to see me yesterday.
I'll be in the lab.
Can you tell me your room number?
I suspect Tom has no idea what Mary did.
Patients often die simply because they get swallowed up in front of their diseases.
I wouldn't think the tofuto was so delicious.
Are you jealous?
Who's planning this trip?
Now what time is it?
Then what does that mean?
I haven't had my turn yet.
He's asking you to help him.
I've only been to Boston once.
I don't know where yours is.
He could change his mind.
Do you feel guilty?
You think so?
He learned how to swim.
Can't you really swim?
New York is a big city.
I'm too low.
I was hoping I could get back to the beach next weekend.
I'm running out of venison.
I can't do it on my own.
I hope you're right.
If you tell her about it, then she will tell her best friends, then her best friends will tell her best friends, and eventually everyone will understand.
She was cold.
Tom's talking to the French accent.
I've never seen a rainbow.
Ken can swim, right?
Tom and Mary went to the moonpark.
I thought it was best not to say anything about it.
I'm not a student.
Do you watch carefully?
A few minutes later, the phone called.
She wasn't even there.
Jane is from Australia.
Close the door if you like.
Tom finally left.
Tom assumed Mary wouldn't come to the party.
That's the sweetest bitch I've ever seen.
I'm not mean.
In this restaurant, food is good.
I'm not dealing with this.
Are they wrong?
You parked in my place.
I don't know where he is.
You're created by unemployment.
I have to take my son at 2:30.
Sugar is sweet.
Where are you going?
It's a big verse.
The prices have fallen lately.
Tom's an interesting man.
Are you trying to take me down?
If you're late for the check-in, it won't be accepted.
I'm a little busy right now.
Are you worried?
Calm down.
Tom wants more money.
Is this your family?
It was a terrible day.
I don't live with Tom.
Do you still love Tom?
I won't be able to transfer Tom from the other side of the bridge.
Where shall we go?
You can't get mad at me for that.
I grabbed the cat for the door.
Looks like he'll win.
I think you need a vacation.
It can't be what it looks like.
I think I found something better.
There used to be a lot of frogs in this lake.
I get it.
Depends on the context.
Has something changed?
I'm not that brave.
He prefers French to German.
You can read in French, right?
Fred's often late for an hour.
Don't cry.
Who's thirsty?
The girl eats bread.
I love coupons.
I don't know what it is.
I can't buy you this dress.
I heard him come down the stairs.
A friend will be visiting tomorrow.
I hope that's what's going to happen.
Maybe Miss Satou sent the flowers.
Take us to the center.
The sea was calm.
She's an atheist.
Tom was impatient and nervous.
I need a new USB cable.
You're driving too fast.
Can I trust you?
It's hard to please Tom.
How long are you gonna get mad at me?
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Why did you run away?
Who's your favorite bird?
You can learn here.
Let me help you.
You'll get it!
I'm afraid I've touched you.
There's nothing to worry about.
This is my house.
He's out of experience.
I didn't know you were cooking.
Tom didn't pay any attention to Mary.
Put these glasses on if you like.
I heard it was nice.
Tom doesn't like this color.
I feel safer here.
I want to be young again.
Tom refused to leave.
He's got pink hair.
I don't know when he'll be here.
Mary told John the secret.
I'll study French next semester.
Tom won't speak today.
I'll see you tonight.
I'm done with my money.
I got him a cup of coffee.
Where's your babysitter?
Nothing ever happens like you thought.
Why don't you want to wear a tie?
Children should obey their parents.
Is there any error in this exercise?
Can you come by Sunday night?
I remember meeting you before.
I look at him as my best friend.
Nobody picked up the phone.
I've seen you somewhere before.
You're learning the experiment.
The new bike is worth 50,000 yen.
I think you're crazy.
Keep it till later.
They're best friends.
You're a problem.
You're so superficial.
I have great news.
Looks like it's snowing, doesn't it?
It's a long story.
We solved the problem.
Does Tom know where Mary was born?
He decided to go there.
I hate her, but I don't know why.
Tom seems objective.
The tunnel went down due to the earthquake from the previous day.
I need to talk to you about Tom.
Mary spoke Japanese slowly.
What are you doing all this time?
My uncle never writes letters.
Shut the damn door!
We were playing for him.
John came a week ago.
He refused the offer.
Oh, I forgot my keys.
Excuse me, I have a request.
The brat is a man who shaves his beards and cuts men's hair.
Do you like Mozart's music?
That's my problem.
Is that yours, Tom?
We're not all that stupid.
Any problem can be solved if you are patient and patient.
Tom started studying French three years ago.
You have a phone.
How old are you?
Tom works there.
I'm not her type.
Are you free tomorrow night?
He lives around.
Tom loved singing, but no one wanted to hear him sing.
Tom wasn't lying on the ground.
I think we can do better.
I think you should think about it.
I'm not mean.
I'm the most common office worker.
He was in France.
Don't let that bother you.
Have you ever seen kangaroo?
Tom can't figure out how to open the box.
I think Tom's serious.
I'll tell them I'm not coming in time.
He often goes on foot to school.
The socks stink.
When are you getting married?
It's pheasant.
He got off the train.
You're so hot.
How many episodes of "Wan Pace" have you seen?
Her name is known to everyone.
I think you're perfect.
Is that the difference?
You can take pictures outside the museum, but not inside.
Let me go.
You're both sweet and sweet.
My sister lives near Yokohama.
I think you should make the deal.
My intention wasn't like that.
I need to get out of here for a while.
She loves the color of her shirt.
Hey, man, I'm begging you a lot. Squeeze some insecticide behind the fridge.
She denied me I didn't answer the letter.
I'm tired.
Your English is improving.
It's your turn.
Put another pair of socks in your bag.
Soon after that, it started to rain.
I have to go back to Boston tomorrow.
They don't want permits.
Tom sent a message to Mary, written in French.
I'm glad you're happy.
When the conversation is over, he says friendly goodbye and wishes me a good evening.
Let's check it out.
So far, you've done a good job.
I made dinner last night.
Tom can't stand it.
It's hard for me to concentrate today.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Who told you my name was that?
Aren't you impressed?
Tom's not here today.
I have to buy one of these.
She helped him himself.
I got a job for Tom.
Where'd you throw them away?
As usual, the physics teacher is late for the hour.
Let's find out what's right and what's wrong.
I forgot to turn off the lights.
Can I take a picture of you?
"Can I park here?" "No, you can't."
I saw you somewhere.
You've been sitting in my place.
I've already tried this way.
You don't speak French, do you?
I'm ready to order.
Students should not use this toilet.
You're in a winning show.
I want something to drink.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
She leaves no time for anything but to take care of the baby.
It's nice to meet you, too.
The movie wasn't as interesting as the book.
Let's go!
I don't want to be upset.
I don't think Tom's number is on the line.
Can you do it on your own?
Thank you very much for your detailed explanation.
I'm the only one who knows them.
I'll join her after dinner.
These containers are closed in hermetically.
He's the best player in our team.
I've seen you before.
There's no one.
I want more information.
Are you carrying a gun?
He says he's avoided the danger of becoming a dead man.
Are you home?
Can you tell me what to do?
Take care of her.
Don't shoot.
Isn't that surprising?
He's friends with everyone he meets.
You have to learn more carefully.
I'm sorry, but I don't believe it.
I just don't get it.
He broke into a house.
I arrived later than usual.
We're not disappointed.
She was scared.
I was your mother's first friend.
The Karanica broke our unity.
How much money can I take with me?
Tom's with the French.
I'm falling for stories like that.
I'm used to it.
Welcome to Japan.
She's just shopping.
Don't forget it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
"Who are these socks?" "To my sister."
I think you should call Tom.
She was a tall, strong blonde.
I gave Mary a book.
His dormitory told him not to eat between the main meals.
Any survivors?
The wrist is attached to her legs.
We chose Jack as president.
This is my friend Tom.
They broke up with each other.
Tom is a French teacher.
We're going down to the next station.
Tom asked Mary to meet him at his office tomorrow.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom's got light skin.
Thank you, that's all.
The engine doesn't want to burn.
I'm early.
Let's go to private.
Jesse accepted the invitation right away.
Jack Nickelson grew up in New Jersey.
Is there a free will?
I'll be there.
I think it's Tom's bike.
I have to go see Tom.
It's been a long time since the last such nice surprise to me.
Let's play Canadian.
I think we have enough time.
Yunko's a good girl.
Let's have lunch.
I've been waiting so long.
Aren't they cute?
I can't change these plans.
I'll be home soon.
He was on his way to work.
I had a little temperature this morning.
The medicine works.
I can't go anymore.
Tom has a very big nose.
Is this the right direction for the museum?
The school starts at eight and a half.
It happened twice.
Deep breath is healthy.
When was the last time you went to the beach?
We've gone crazy worried about you.
He can't read.
You're doing great.
The arguments won't solve anything.
Maybe it's wrong.
I hope this will make it easier to understand the meaning and remember the newly learned words.
I think they know us.
I have no intention of hurting you.
Can you introduce me to a doctor who speaks French?
Are you asleep?
Our team was with red flanges.
How about a walk by the beach?
These dogs are big.
Everybody say cheese.
Tom won't be paid.
The rain stopped me from coming out.
When I was your age, we had to walk up the slope to school, both in both directions.
He'll be busy tomorrow.
I have no idea what I'm doing here.
Nothing more, thank you.
I've already tried.
I think you're working too hard.
He drank a lot yesterday.
This won't help you.
Just do what Tom says.
Prisoners were released.
Be careful with that.
I can't see anything.
The meeting was postponed.
You don't have to worry.
It was a great day.
How old was he?
That's off!
Tom doesn't see you.
I wrote to my teacher in French.
Aren't you coming?
I'll stay till lunch.
I forgot his name.
I think you'll be happy.
Let's not talk about this anymore.
So, what's the problem?
It wasn't that hard.
It's business.
Please lock the safe.
She broke up with me.
They're both alive.
I'm too low.
Tom went abroad to study French.
Tom gave his visit to Mary.
I think it's better if you stay with Tom.
He didn't do it, Tom.
That's the job I chose.
I think our gas's over.
Let me tell you something about myself.
We pushed the car.
What's the minimum wage in Germany?
We have something for you.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I don't eat pork.
Your coming here was a mistake.
The newspaper publishes a profile of its new editor.
The act was broken from the very beginning.
Why don't we get him a bottle of wine?
Five days after she finished, my daughter flew from Osaka airport to Germany.
The boy laughs at the girl.
Please don't touch.
I saw Tom around here.
I need to get in touch with Tom.
I haven't bathed in three days.
Just close your eyes.
Let's get together.
I just created a new text-processing program with which words can speak back.
I'm sure we need Tom's help.
Please give me a pillow and a suit.
Your jacket and your tie aren't leaving.
I'll be as young as you.
I was surprised how well Tom speaks French.
Tom lives a little below the same street Mary lives on.
The new teacher is in the classroom.
Hurry up or you'll miss the bus.
I think I told you never to go there alone.
I think you'll be impressed.
He's in jail.
I think your answer is right.
I don't speak French as freely as Tom.
Tomorrow's Mother's Day.
Choose the one you like.
In a clear time from here, you can see Mount Fuji.
Kate felt it.
You're a dreamer.

Can't anything be done?
I have some information.
I love French.
He was our leader.
I'll get it.
The ship transports raw materials from Indonesia.
This is my sister's picture.
You'll be sorry.
No one in her school is a better swimmer than she is.
Is there a big house?
He drinks too much beer.
She's very tender and she's worried when she's at a party.
I think Tom's a good name.
As long as I'm alive, you won't be deprived of anything.
I heard what happened.
I like your shirt.
I'm telling you, she looks like her mother.
You have to apologize.
How do you know that?
Tom may object.
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I think it's better to give up.
Parents often make sacrifices to provide good education for their children.
Where are you from?
Looks like your dog's thirsty.
You're leaving for London next week, aren't you?
I have plans for tonight.
I wouldn't bet on that.
You don't look too surprised.
Apparently it worked.
I need to learn Tom about this.
That's a good sign.
Tom jumped through the window.
Let me tell you, it's my fault.
Let me call you.
I gave them clothes and some food.
You're wearing your socks on the wrong side.
I'll be up early tomorrow.
You like French, don't you?
You almost got her in the car.
Tom's not like them.
I left my credit card at home.
It's too hot.
Your blood's flowing.
I just want to be with you.
I want to learn French.
She's eating an apple.
I think you should check under the couch.
My car was stolen last night.
Tom wasn't at the party.
Are you good enough?
Why don't you take your umbrella anyway?
I really want it.
Maybe I'm not right.
Are you done with the breakfast?
It wasn't my fault.
Read it again.
He arrived earlier than usual.
I talked to him about it on the phone.
I think you're very talented.
The voyages were almost empty.
We need more research.
It's your responsibility.
Come and see us.
I have to push my bike because one of the tires has fallen.
This shirt is a standard size.
Don't play with me.
I put my hand on her shoulder.
From the store to the house, I carried the heavy luggage and called myself ho-o-op-hop.
What languages are spoken in America?
That's amazing.
Listening to the news, she fell.
Don't be disappointed.
He fell asleep in the morning.
If you're not satisfied with the service, don't give up.
I'll remember tonight.
They don't pay me enough.
I got up early yesterday.
In the last two months, Tom has been moving from place to place.
I think you should go out.
He comes here twice a week.
This primary school has a strong football team.
How can Tom not like you?
Hitomi looked very happy.
Are you subscribed to any magazines?
I'm afraid I won't make it for the lunch we made.
Right!
That's probably the key Tom's looking for.
I had to walk there because my car broke down.
It's still happening.
I have a lot of friends who speak French well.
I felt isolated.

Let's vote.
The wounded were hit with a ambulance.
Don't move!
He baptized his dog Popey.
There are people I need to talk to.
Tom speaks a little French.
I think you're missing something.
You always sing.
I forgot it in the garage.
I owe him 1,000 yen.
How can I find you?
Nick owes me ten bucks.
I don't want to work under those conditions.
Don't punish Tom for that.
I've never seen you so scared.
Tom scored three points.
Do you like walking down the beach?
When are you leaving?
Anybody with you?
Tom can't believe what's going on.
Is he having fun last night?
In fact, he's wrong.
They're already here.
Sit a man in the kitchen.
I'll get it back.
When does the art museum close?
I was busy this week.
You're coming from Sweden.
I thought we'd have breakfast together.
Swallow it.
Tom teaches sports psychology.
What do you want?
Looks like you've changed the whole room.

You're so responsive.
I think you're perfect.
The army was supposed to withdraw.
Your success depends on whether you're going to take STEP exams or not.
I always wondered if you'd come back.
Tom never talks about his feelings.
He raised his hands.
One coffee, if you like.
I haven't heard from Jane since she moved to Tokyo.
It was like a glass.
I think you'll be impressed.
He thanks me for coming.
He's lower than Tom.
Can you drive?
I can't speak English. I can't speak Spanish.
Someone must have stolen your watch.
Tom grew up speaking French and English.
What are you doing now?
The museum deserves to be visited.
Tom's gonna be gone for a week.
I'm looking for a gift for my father.
The problem doesn't deserve to be discussed.
It was pretty cold.
"For here or at home?" "For here, thank you."
Bob came home too late.
The elevators aren't working.
He wants you to do something like that.
Don't be afraid. You'll be fine.
I took her to town.
Anyway, you'll never understand.
Believe it or not, peachs and almonds are from one family.
You want to hear something funny?
There are not enough chairs in the conference room.
I have no idea.
Tom wasn't perfect.
When I was a university student, I never slept the night before the exam.
I really want this.
Today I learned a lot of Spanish words, and now I know how to say "buse", "brain" and "kolano".
I'm sleeping with two Jurgans in the winter.
Let's split it up.
I'll turn around.
You can go.
I haven't seen these pictures before.
Tom's having a hard time in such situations.
He didn't like her.
He's got a strong body.
Are you scared?
Everyone knew Tom could speak French well.
Tomorrow's Sunday.
Tom doesn't see without his glasses.
Are these edible?
Something's moving down there.
I wouldn't blame you.
Maybe Tom wasn't wrong.
It was over.
I'd like a copy of this report.
Tom's broken.
Sentenced to death.

Did he drive with an express train soon?
See if you're late.
Are you involved?
I heard Tom was hurt.
How many episodes of One Piece have you seen?
I heard they caught Tom's killer.
I really had a great time.
It's time for you to go.
Just thinking about the incident I'm running.
I've seen them before.
Why is Tom angry?
He speaks Japanese well.
The director thinks he can't fire Tom.
I'll be with Tom.
"How many candles are you having on your birthday?" "Fifty-six."
The scarves are wrapped in the hand.
It's three days late.
Read it again.
The word expresses my feelings.
Tom has bad news.
Where did Tom say we should go?
Go wake up, Tom.
I just finished doing my homework in French.
I'm looking for my chemist.
Let's have dinner.
I'll visit him tomorrow.
This guy was a jerk.
Tom likes to wear white socks with his sandals.
That's in conflict with my principles.
I don't know why Tom's so angry.
What are the facts?
He asked me to take off.
I'm the one who saved Tom.
I've seen you somewhere.
She translated the letter from Japanese into French.
Am I fired?
Did anyone see you?

What'd you get mad at?
How do you know that?
I forgot.
He's in the pandas.
I don't know what to do next.
There's no flow since morning.
There's a hole in my den.
Tom works extraordinarily.
He's really good at talking.
I think you're making a mistake.
I've never heard Tom complain before.
They're probably drunk.
I'll show you where to go.
I don't have personal space.
We have something for you.
I just finished my home in French.
Tom just made it.
I didn't expect Tom to be there.
How old are your cousins?
Your French has improved significantly.
What's in your suitcase?
We're getting married by the end of March.
He raised his hands.
Can I ask you a personal question?
I wish you luck.
I think Tom was trying to warn us about something.
He's married to a nice girl.
I took care of it.
Aren't you interested?
It's something quite different.
His brother, his sisters, or he'll go to the station to meet his father.
I gave up on Tom.
He disappeared without a trace.
You've been very brave.
When it comes to travels, have you ever been to Kobe?

I'm changing the train to the other station.
I heard you encouraging me.
I'll give you this book.
I don't remember that.
Where did you buy flowers?
I won't work here for long.
We want our own house.
I have to say it.
In theory, it should be done.

Snow was up to the knee.
I feel bad today.
It's so sad to see Tom ask for money on the street after he's lost all his gambling money.
I've never seen anything like it.
You won't be the only ones there.
Do you understand me?
Are you speaking Turkish?
I put it in your room.
No one's home.
He still wants to come.
We need to postpone the honor.
Tom looks great.
What could Tom do there?
I think it's Tom.
Just what I said could happen, it happened.
I was trained at this school.
Good morning.
I think you'll find that interesting.

Are you carrying money in yourself?
Why didn't you tell me in advance?
I'll be back next week.
Stay with me, Tom.
The old man gave the child a cover.
I'll see you soon.
I'd like to live near your house.
I think we were lucky.
I have to put an end to this.
You're so superficial.
That won't change anything.

I'm surprised this building is still standing.
I need to meet Tom.
Although at times Tom's English looks pretty good, he has no idea where his possibilities are being extended and it's impossible to convince him that he's wrong when he makes a mistake.
Are you John?
America needs you.
You have to decide.
I've seen a lot of tourists on the beach.
I heard you were fighting Tom.
Will you call me back?
What's your home address?
Outside the dog, the book is the man's best friend, inside the dog is too dark to read.
It's not okay.
My mother made me a very nice sex.
You have to start right now.
It's an old letter.
Are you involved in some kind of social activity?
Are you interested?
Apparently Tom was known before he released this album.
The Romans would not have had a chance to conquer the world if they were first required to learn Latin.
I paid 50 bucks.
Don't drink this.
I think it's best to get out of here.
Aren't you married?
That's what you've always wanted.
I'd like you to translate this document into French.
Tom was fired.
Clear the table now!
Mary is interested in politics.
She won't believe it.
Do you speak Turkish?
Don't hesitate to ask questions.
The bees make honey.
Tom doesn't want to admit he doesn't know how to do it.
Only I know them.
They got 350 years of iron in this town.
I'm playing a TV game.
He was in Japan.
Let's have a walk.
Are you still collecting stamps?
My name is Ichiro Tanaka.
Last year, imports overrun the export.
You don't have a temperature.
Did anyone tell you?
I'm not afraid of death, I just don't want to be there when it happens.
Don't let him do it.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
I put my coat on the table.
This is the place.
A woman in a wheelchair is hiding in a supermarket.
This is your last chance to spend some time with Tom.
Can you speak French well?
What kind of man would do something like that?
I don't like snow.
Jane was waiting, washing her back in the tree.
We'll do our best.
Let's get up there and talk.
Tom didn't call me.
Tom doesn't like chess.
Those clothes are good for you.
I've been learning French for three years.
I think you should go out now.
Please go.
I thought you didn't like Tom.
Tom looks really happy.
I've never heard Tom speak French before.
She's French.
Soldiers are used to the dangers.
I know a little French.
Please enter your contact address here.
Have a good appetite!
I knew you'd find Tom.
We're here first.
Are you gonna make it?
The police found a body thrown on the shore near here.
We all speak French.
The Lord best knows the value of his own life.
I appreciate you coming to pick me up.
Check to see if you turned off the TV before you fell asleep.
And my hands were shaking.
From now on, be more careful.
Tom jumped into cold water.
Are you registered?
If there's no life after death, you better do something about that life.
I hope things are going to work out for you, Tom.
Let me help you.
Don't let yourself be used.
I think you're the ones who need help.
The corridor's slippery, be careful.
Languages such as Russian, Polish, Czech and Bulgarian have common Slavic roots.
Tom has to do this now.
You don't have to say that to your parents.
Let's just say things straight!
She's the woman I gave the gift to.
Let me go alone.
I don't understand what he said.
This situation is ridiculous.
This land is Tom's.
I think you should meet Tom.
Don't add any annotations.
There's no one else.
Your soul will be mine!
Many of my friends can speak French.
He plays well on the guitar.
Did you play Mincroft?
Nancy's afraid of dogs.
You'll be surprised what people think.
Are you taking any medication at this time?
The tree's burning.
I heard every word you said.
I haven't agreed yet.
I have to admit I'm sorry.
Jack speaks English.
I want to see you.
I'm not jealous.
We were going to drive.
Can I take your coat?
My dad's gonna make me a delicious party tomorrow morning.
My TV's broken.
Tom just shut down the phone.
Are you ready?
I won't believe it until I hear it from Tom.
Tom can't see you.
Bass hunts you're busy.
Come see us.
Looks like you had a hard day.
Tom doesn't give up.
But I want you to know what I'm saying.
I need to talk to you.
I don't believe that at all.
I haven't spoken to Tom yet.
Are you involved?
What did you do with the camera?
I kept filming.
There are fewer teenagers working today.
Why am I still listening to this?
Please don't.
Tom's letter isn't very beautiful, but it's legible.
Shoichi's face is on the lookout.
An electric current can generate a magnetic field.
Will you mind if you include the radio?
I've got things to do tomorrow.
The tower was smashed into dust and dust.
America's too big.
I heard the car stopped.
Send her my regards.
Is your wife a blonde, or is she a brunette?
I'm out. I'm driving my bike.
The men brought the boy to the hospital.
They were talking too fast to figure out what they were saying.
Tom's hurt!
Are you sure Tom knows what to do?
Can we trust her?
That's the camera Tom took the pictures with.
Let's watch TV.
He killed that man.
Do good to those who hate you.
I have to go.
What's the whole story?
Don't push me.
What are your plans for Christmas?
Another bottle of wine, please.
It's time to go to work.
You were given a chance.
Would you put the dishes in the sink?
We found out where he lives.
It's not that deep.
He's a great scientist.
She wants a divorce.
The new magazine became very interesting to me.
Maybe we can help Tom.
We went on a journey full of hope.
I'll be here.
I don't have any wood.
I think you're really amazing.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom helped Mary move the locker.
Tell Tom to explain.
What's your relationship with him?
I'm Tom Hunter.
That's a little weird.
Can you do it on your own?
In the spring, the days are getting longer.
Mary let Tom kiss her.
I've never seen you cry.
Sometimes I hear my father sing in the bathroom.
In Singapore, English is spoken.
I eat bread.
That request was rejected.
You were right.
He was tired, and yet he went to help them.
Tom's not going to school next week.
Do what I tell you.
The kids are already tired.
You want to watch a French movie, don't you?
We played for victory.
What's in the coffee?
The crucible's burned.
I have to get Tom's money back.
The more books he has, the more I have.
They didn't find Tom.
Are you sure you don't want to wait till tomorrow?
I'll always remember your goodness.
This smell and another time I felt it.
Everyone's dying.
I didn't get it.
Give me the hammer.
He hates to market.
I think you'll be happy.
I didn't tell him everything.
I don't want her to give up.
Mary is a book worm.
I think you're capable of anything.
He objected to her plan.
I don't think we should.
You won't be alone.
Looks like the dog wants to eat something.
This box is a little harder than it should be.
It's a famous mountain.
I could make you happy.
He told me how to get to the museum.
He likes to go fishing.
Is Tom still in school?
Texas is almost twice the size of Japan.
Either you or you!
I hope it's not too late.
His clothes always smell bad.
I think you should listen to me.
I forgot your number.
I've only been there once.
Put your jacket on the hook at the door.
Tom lives on three cliffs off the coast.
He's a little famous.
I love pizza very much.
I'll try it again.
Just answer the question.
Leave him for another man.
Tom admitted he was scared.
If you listen a little more carefully to what the teacher says, you'll probably understand.
I think you should check under the bed.
The movie wasn't as fun as the book.
The job didn't bother me.
I think you're perfect.
Every human being is part of the whole called the Universe - part limited in time and space. It perceives itself, its thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest - a sort of optical illusion of his consciousness. This illusion is a self-shaped prison for us, limiting us within our personal desires and attachment to our closest people. Our task must be to get rid of this prison, expanding the circle of our compassion, so that it embraces all living beings and nature in all and beauty.
He'll definitely come.
I know him.
Aren't you going?
He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
Do I have to fill out this French form?
This local newspaper is published once a week.
I don't know who he is.
It's almost three hours.
I want to know more about you, Tom.
He just became a director.
We're studying French.
I think Tom and Mary love each other.
What is this thing?
Never give dog food to your cat.
I have problems with French grammar.
I stabbed him through the face.
I'll make you happy.
You won't believe it.
Do I have to open everything?
It's totally different now.
You're always late.
Let's keep going.
The walls were painted in a light brown.
Betty killed him.
Have you started learning French yet?
You can't read in French, can you?
Your blouse fits very well with this sex.
Can't you do something?
Lucy's from America.
Do you really want to work in Boston?
Tom's not lying down.
Are you involved?
It's very big.
Tom just got back from Boston.
Ask me again later.
He's my older brother.
She became famous.
She turned down his invitation.
We pray for peace.
I think you'll find it very interesting.
I didn't insult you to "stupid."
He and I are friends.
Our best friend is a doctor.
There's something in Tom that pisses me off.
Both Tom's parents were teachers.
Don't play baseball here.
Tom's a long way from here?
Bad weather didn't let me leave.
She's a nice girl.
Bob's a nice man.
Looks like he's happy.
They came out on my feet.
Why is that so funny?
Follow my example and take a glass of wine.
Are you John?
I forbid smoking in my room.
I need to figure out when Tom's gonna go.
She read the letter.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
He shot at me.
The dogs are allowed.
Everyone thinks about changing the world, but nobody thinks about changing themselves.
She wants to get divorced.
You have to learn hard.
Did you accept his invitation?
If you don't want to be alone, I can make you a company.
I heard the shots.
I didn't intend to put you in an awkward position.
Who did you translate for?
If there's a desire, there's a way.
I think Tom made a big mistake.
If you relax and rest, you'll feel much better.
Are you done with the breakfast?
I've got some old computers.
Tom was wondering where Mary spent her childhood.
Are you coming or not?
Are you speaking Georgian?
Tom and Mary both pulled their guns.
Are the cats dreaming?
Do you know this girl?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
This is the hotel where Tom usually stays.
Tom was relieved.
You better not walk.
I know what I want.
Let's go ask her.
We usually speak French.
I'd like a blouse that fits this jacket.
I have no idea what Tom said.
He's a kind of star.
I thought Tom might be your girlfriend.
You always complain.
The milk's sour.
The second lesson is very easy.
I love your name.
We need to protect our children.
I'll stay home.
Take one of these.
What's your relationship with him?
The devil's habit must be forgotten.
My brother told me he's not afraid of the dark.
Tom, I really hate him.
The problem was I had nothing to tell him.
I think Tom was really having fun.
I wouldn't do it.
Why don't you take off your coat?
Let's talk seriously about your future.
I've got a few calls to make, too.
Whatever happens, we'll make them talk.
Would you be so kind to close that window?
The old couple went on a journey around the world.
When I woke up, there was no one at home, and I was abandoned all day.
My math is my favorite subject.
What day do you usually rest?
Tom came back to pick up his coat.
I'd better go see what Tom found out.
Tom came home all the way home covered with mud.
Did you actually try?
The storm stopped the plane from flying.
Tell me you have good news.
Which browser are you using?
I remember what he said.
What's the minimum wage in your country?
I think you should think again.
I missed you so much.
What kind of reader are you gonna take-- Kindle, Nook or Kobo?
Is this your book, Mike?
I usually run every morning.
The bell rings at eight o'clock.
Mr. Smith is charged with a breach of the contract.
Ken's running faster than you.
They talked to each other.
Are you asleep, honey?
She gave birth to twins.
Five gallons normal, if you love.
I haven't been here much.
Take care.
That's very big.
I think you'll be surprised.
Do you speak German?
Put your coat on.
I bought some books from the bookstore.
Be nice.
Last night there was a terrible crash.
He answered the questions correctly.
Put on your tourist shoes and don't waste your time.
Why did you come so early?
If you're judging on your great tan, you seem to have spent most of your vacation on the beach.
Tomorrow's probably snowing.
I have no idea who Tom is.
Laura may have been sick.
Tom knows what's actually going on.
Tom can resist.
She was perfect.
I have to keep trying.
There was a museum of art in this area before.
I thought your feelings might have changed.
Sooner or later his luck will end.
He pretends he's gonna be okay tonight.
Ann doesn't have any sisters.
Is it really so hard to speak French?
When was the last time he traveled by train?
Tom saw it, too.
I'm not trying to push you.
You're running.
Don't stay in bed unless you can get money out of bed.
Tom has to do this now.
I could make you happy.
My dear, if the meal isn't over by seven o'clock, I'll go to the restaurant.
He let me wait a long time.
I'll be right there.
They made us work all night.
He likes English very much.
I understand about your party.
They have to change their mood.
Do you want me to repeat the question?
The book is interesting.
She was young.
They're hiding in the wardrobe.
What's the minimum wage in Russia?
He loves her.
Try to figure out when the train's leaving.
You have to deal with French more seriously.
I want to go there again.
It's really stupid of you to say something like that.
They have to pay in advance.
Do you love music?
He was born and raised in Tokyo.
I guess I'm working.
She waited until the water closed before she made tea with her.
I think Tom speaks French well.
Tom has to go.
He was very patient.
It's not likely they'll be here in this late hour.
The teacher said he'd do it in three months so that we could all speak French without stopping.
I caught three fish yesterday.
He goes there every day.
It's been a disaster.
Have you ever heard anyone speak French?
And no one's talking about what I told you.
We want to rent an apartment in town.
I think you should come down here.
We arrived last afternoon by train.
Tom's gone, but Mary's still here.
Pick your favorite rocket.
I'll get you some sushi.
Come on for today.
My brother claims he's not afraid of the dark.
Save a man, eat a cannibal.
Everything looks fine.
Are you sure you don't want me to help you?
Tom speaks French awfully.
Don't you accept credit cards?
Tom's drinking water.
Did he offer you?
You want me to help you?
You don't have to go.
Please give me a pack.
What's Tom afraid of?
You always sing.
I completely forgot about Tom.
I wouldn't be so sure.
My father was about to leave when the phone rang.
He was asking about you.
Ken never went to Kyoto.
The fog prevented him from seeing far away.
Ann's a cheerleader.
I'm trying to learn English.
Tom went to the post office to send a letter.
Look carefully at the wall map.
Maybe it's not enough.
Don't send me any more notes.
Are you sure you don't want to drive?
I think you'll find it very interesting.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
I haven't taken a shower in three days.
I've lost shape.
Bring me a chair, please.
It wasn't a stupid idea.
Maybe you'll be happier on another job.
I like your shirt.
That's very important.
Thank you for your work.
Drive straight along the road and when you're passing the lighthouse, you're there.
Do what you want.
Some people would certainly ask, why don't we just pick up our stuff and get out of Afghanistan?
Get your socks up if you like.
I don't have ammo.
I'd like to get your picture.
Please take it off.
"What's your car brand?" "It's Ford."
I tried to be your friend.
His wifeâ€™s second cousin was a member of the Jewish governing council.
Would you help me translate this?
America has enemies.
Did you see Tom?
We'll be back.
Give it back to me!
Say hello to Jimmy from me.
I haven't spoken to Tom in three weeks.
Stop kneeling.
I know what Tom's doing here.
I know a man who speaks French well.
I think you've made a mistake.
He didn't stop him from staying up all night.
You probably already know about our company.
I think you've asked enough questions.
Tom doesn't have to know that.
Some people have an inability to travel by sea.
My plane flew off at six o'clock.
I don't know any of the boys.
We're ready to go.
That's a clue.
It's really delicious.
As long as I'm alive, you won't be deprived of anything.
Maria showed us their home.
I heard steps, but I didn't see anyone.
Is that our problem?
He gave her a letter.
Uncle gave me his car.
I really appreciate that.
Tom, put your helmet on.
I've never seen anything like that.
I have an opinion.
I did it myself.
My name is Emily.
There's nothing else to do.
I need to get dressed.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
I haven't figured that out yet.
I need to talk to Tom.
Last night the game was exciting.
The broad jackets are the last piece of fashion.
Don't get lost.
With a little good will on both sides, our problems should be able to be solved.
I don't have much money.
She went up the stairs quickly.
The house we used to live in was destroyed.
I'll get married next week.
The prices will continue to rise.
We're learning French together.
In high school, my French was my favorite subject.
Would you call Tom?
No one knows whether he loves her or not.
Get me off this side of the world, if you like.
I think Tom's hiding from Mary.
Oh, I was sick.
Show us.
Why don't you laugh?
Have you ever greeted PfrichbÃ¤umchen in German?
It's an accident.
I would never hurt them.
I know about this study.
Wouldn't it be nice?
I don't know French, but Greek.
He let himself be known that he was against the plan.
She can jump high.
Why do I sleep so much?
She answered through tears.
When are you going?
Hannah grew up higher than her mother.
That's completely different.
The elephant's gray.
I'm studying French at home.
Don't raise that much noise, please.
Did any of you ever see Tom?
I'll go alone.
He's stronger than you.
I'm dangerous.
Show me this list.
That's all Tom has to do.
Our son is getting married and we want to make our heads up.
Don't go to that building.
Why isn't Tom at school?
Would you like to eat that cupcake?
I worked hard last month.
I knew he'd take it.
Don't leave town.
I heard Tom and Mary talk to each other.
We met in London.
Do you have any wine?
This may prove a little overwhelming.
Looks like our water's running out.
Take whatever you like.
I have to tell Tom.
That was very personal.
Do they both understand French?
Something was taken.
Green is coming to Alice.
Our garbage gathers three times a week.
They caught the fox in the trap.
You're early.
You love the kids, don't you?
I felt isolated.
What do you want?
I'm sad.
They're late for the storm.
I guess it won't be a problem.
Speak slower, if you love.
"Where do you live?" "I live in Tokyo."
I'm busy right now.
I feel so bad.
We were soldiers.
Work is not only a necessity but also a pleasure.
We need to be careful.
It's eleven now.
I run every day.
I think that's Tom.
How was last weekend, Nancy?
Are you learning French?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I'm not unreasonable.
I have to report this.
I've never been so proud of Tom.
You need to use a deodorant.
When you stand up to me, you're the world.
Actually, I'm not sure who Tom is.
There are some things I need to take care of.
I never doubt his honesty.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not going to teach that.
You don't look too surprised.
This is a warning that we should take seriously.
What does the fox say?
We'd like to eat, can you serve us quickly?
Let's get our jacket.
Tell me a joke.
Tom is practicing speaking French at every opportunity.
I've seen Tom do amazing things.
The apples are red.
You've got nice hands.
People are all against war.
Your hair needs a haircut.
I'm better.
Tom hasn't met with me before.
Can I see your driver's book?
It's never gonna end.
Tom teaches me French twice a week.
Why don't you just tell us what's stopping you?
Maybe they have something.
I could make you happy.
Who's hurt your tooth?
We learn French.
What makes you think so?
You were sitting in my place.
We know who you are.
Do you love black cats?
We teach French every day at school.
Do you believe in miracles?
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Tom looks lonely.
Let me tell you something about myself.
I haven't seen Tom since I was thirteen.
Her hobby is to collect postage stamps.
I don't have anything.
Have you ever painted this house?
If we were expected to speak more than we were to hear, we would be given two mouths and one ear.
Don't play baseball here.
I got your coat.
We had a great time last night.
I'll drive to Detroit.
You won't believe how popular Tom is.
Did you make it?
My dad often takes me to baseball games.
Are you brothers?
I felt very uncomfortable because I didn't speak French.
Tom's friend threatened to leave him.
Aren't you afraid of something?
He didn't know anything about him since he left for America.
Now I'm gonna have to deal with this.
I was shaking my hands in my pockets.
I would never hurt them.
What's your son's name?
I've never seen you so nervous.
He's become a great musician.
I'm counting on you.
Aren't you nervous?
Have you ever heard of your sister?
Everyone's hungry.
She's down the stairs.
I was alone, I learned.
I didn't tell Tom.
I think you're still in love with Tom.
I think it's better to sit down.
Our sales are down.
I saw Bob this morning.
Bring me something to eat.
If you have not paid for the default, please send the due amount and allow us to remove the problem immediately.
It smells like a toilet here.
I'm here for a break.
Looks like you're alone.
The question is being considered.
Tom was saved by a random passerby.
The village's in the center of town.
They're not hungry.
Call me if you need me.
Let's change the subject.
The bar is full of people.
I'm so hungry.
It's very kind of you to turn away from your way to help me.
Tom decided Mary's story is interesting.
How about we stop the car and rest?
Tom lives in the same part of the city where Mary lives.
Now it's a little after eleven without a quarter.
Both statements are correct.
I hadn't seen any dark before.
We need to call the police.
I have information about Tom.
I'm sure this book has never been translated into French.
I'll see you again.
I'll try it again.
No one could sleep tonight.
Runda's been around five minutes.
He was walking around the country.
The sum of all angles in the triangle is 180 degrees.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.
Mary can speak Japanese.
I need to call Tom.
It's a little cold today.
I'll judge you.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Who let the dogs go?
I don't feel sick.
I can't even read French and what's left to say.
I'll do my best.
I'll come with Tom.
Mike swims very well.
Be careful!
I want a boat that will take me away from here.
Let's talk.
Diamonds are the girl's best friends.
Even when he was young, his parents died, so he grew up to be his uncle.
I saw Tom do the impossible.
I have to warn him.
Where's the station?
Don't throw anything away.
What's going on up there?
The dog couldn't bark.
Is it safe?
He sleeps like a baby.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
I'll follow your instructions.
I have a sharp knife.
You painted the walls, didn't you?
My mother teaches me to arrange flowers.
What a wonderful time!
Don't waste your youth, or you'll regret it later.
I think you'll find it interesting.
But isn't he above the law?
A modern factory is fully automated.
Don't let Tom scare you.
The adoption of English is difficult.
I think you should join us.
Can I open a can?
I didn't do it on purpose.
I haven't seen Tom lately.
I think Tom's leg is broken.
Tom told me he wanted to live on a lonely beach.
Why did Tom want to study French?
This is the place Tom was born to.
Where were you born?
I asked him to send us the book.
I have no idea how it's going.
You're all stupid.
They're exchanging gifts.
I don't mind myself.
Mr. Kolk's Japanese food started to like it.
I put the money in the safe.
We're in a hurry.
Tom heard something.
I hope that's enough.
You need to be aware of this fact.
This one's okay.
I was your mother's first girlfriend.
Tom taught me to speak French.
Would you tell me something about yourself?
I think that's very unlikely.
I want to find my account.
I'm sure Tom knows enough French to fix himself.
I went swimming in the river.
Mary's Tom's older sister.
I don't know either. I don't know the other guy.
The guests should start coming soon.
I'm crazy about football.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
It was so nice!
This isn't your house.
I didn't see anything.
Hey, I just got here.
I'm a hero.
Damn you!
Tom pushed Mary from the edge of the ladder.
I hope Tom's right.
Aren't you happy?
Get ready for the worst.
Fruits under the sun.
She's always late for school.
Tom made some mistakes at the checkpoint.
Time's on my side.
Aren't you happy?
It may take some time.
I thought you might take off.
Let me help you put your coat on.
Watch out, the car's coming!
She speaks three languages.
What do you think of this sweater?
Take it with you.
Now I remember, you don't have to smoke in her car.
Nancy smiled happily.
He's only four minutes from here with a train.
What's he trying to achieve?
Can anyone believe you?
It's a little fat.
I think it's better to go.
Tom said it probably won't take too long.
What's the real reason you don't want to do it?
Can you keep a secret?
Hey, guys, keep your mouth shut!
I would never hurt them.
I learned French.
Can't you stay a little longer?
We stayed in Dorchester.
Are you depressed?
While we were on vacation, a neighbor took care of the cat.
Both Tom's parents were teachers.
Children should listen to their parents.
It's cloudy today.
Do you live in this neighborhood?
They made us work all day.
I think you're capable of anything.
He returned home after he had been away for ten months.
We're moving to Boston next week.
I've never met Tom before.
I called him yesterday.
Let's rest here.
I need to see Tom.
I think you should leave.
I think we were just curious about Tom.
I'll catch the next bus.
Tom's twice as old as Mary.
Mary has two boyfriends.
Kate speaks English very quickly.
I'm not so tired.
You have a veneer infection.
He started writing novels.
He's happy with the result.
Hurry up and you'll be able to catch your train.
You won't need that anymore.
Get him back where you got him.
Let's start.
I fucked you.
Tom found out that Mary was stealing money from the cash in the box.
Give me a drink, please.
Where was that?
I'm a little early.
We're not sure what happened.
I want something to eat.
So he did it anyway.
Can you do it alone?
She's gone.
Do you think I'm so stupid?
If you give someone $20 and you never see it again, then you probably deserve it.
That's Jane's bag.
Tom always smiles.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
Do you think Mary's attractive?
What's the minimum wage in India?
Don't make a decision on this today.
She didn't have much money.
You sat in my place.
When did Tom die?
These two shirts are made of the same material.
Are you learning French?
You don't have to give up English.
It was unfair.
You're wasting your time.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
What's Ken eating?
I went to the hospital.
He did it himself.
Next year, we'll go to college.
What do you eat, fish or meat?
I made a check.
I thought Tom had a rest day.
Why isn't Tom here?
What's Ken doing now?
There are a lot of sentences for DNA, but there's no one for RNA.
One of my parents has to go to the meeting.
Thank you for paying attention to this.
Don't mess with your nose.
The wind blew up.
I want something sweet.
I told Tom the truth.
Her big daughter is married.
Tom speaks French much better than any of his students.
Of the twenty students, only one read the book.
I've got a job Wednesday.
Where's my grandfather?
The Japanese have a tendency to trust established authorities.
I'm back home with the train.
I think I can do it in my spare time.
Shall we go out?
They call me Bob.
What situation would you have done that?
What was the name of the guy you were dating before Tom?
Try it again.
I'd like you to translate this letter into French.
I'm really tired and I want to go to bed early.
Tom's French is very good.
I'm not a philologist.
She lives in New York.
He must be the principal of the school.
I bet I'll get there before you.
He was painted like a clown.
It's not easy in her presence.
She bought him a dog, but he had an allergy to the dogs and they had to give it to others.
I haven't told you yet, have I?
There was no television or radio at that time.
She went to a cab museum.
Look at your job!
He wrote a letter.
I can't agree with Tom.
These socks have holes on their heels.
Tom likes to spit.
You're a good doctor.
I wish you hadn't repeated that word again.
I saw him stop.
She felt her knees shaking.
Edison invented the electric lamp.
Tom asked Mary if she could speak French.
I'll meet him some other time.
She wasn't that strong.
What a strong wind!
That's my CD, isn't it?
I told you not to look for me, Tom.
That's why we're here.
He's dating a group of kids he doesn't need.
It'll be fine if you don't get involved in personal matters.
Do you have to go to the post office?
My veins bleed every time I use toothpaste.
We arrived quickly because the movement was not loaded.
You need to be careful.
What are you missing?
He came back from France soon.
Molly's got a big watch.
Tom's not helping me.
I haven't been in contact with him for a long time.
Those glasses are on your way.
What did you miss?
Tom opened the box and looked inside.
Don't feed until the catch's gone.
I would never lie to you.
Kate's watching a dog.
I don't know everything.
I'll never do that again.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
His friend is a former senator.
Is French harder than English?
I don't care about this pair of shoes.
Is there something you're afraid of?
I have two cousins.
The list falls in the fall.
Aren't you going to do something?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
We can't postpone the council.
Since when did Tom learn French?
He was completely exhausted.
Thank you for coming!
Hey, I'm a little sick.
I'm so ashamed.
Looks like there's already over two thousand Uygur utterances in Tatoeba!
Tom's stubborn.
We can't delay the gathering.
I'm ashamed I did that.
Let's cut in here.
I know this is hard.
Are you an exchange student?
If you need help, ask.
You've always been a little weird.
You think you're going to Tokyo tomorrow?
I hope it's worth it.
Don't give Tom your number.
Is it true that Tom and Mary were arrested?
If mankind does not care about the environment, the environment will destroy mankind.
No, thank you.
I felt like I was rejected among these people.
I think you're gonna have a good time tonight.
Don't clean it up yet.
I'm sorry to interrupt you.
The fact that he's too generous is his biggest flaw.
Press the Shift button.
You understand, don't you?
Jane was always acting like she was very rich.
Tom wasn't the youngest.
I think he's innocent.
Yeah, I know.
I wonder what Tom meant.
It doesn't matter.
I have nothing against the hot weather.
I think you need someone to talk to.
I want new visits.
I'm thirsty.
Flowers are flowing without water.
Do you know why I'm here?
Tom wanted to know why Mary didn't like him.
See, I told you Tom couldn't swim.
I forgot.
The bill, please.
Does the price include breakfast?
Know what he told me.
Salt's over.
She forgot to feed her dog.
That's not the problem.
Go meet him and release this letter in the meantime.
This chicken hasn't worn any eggs lately.
I hear Tom stole a car.
We weren't hungry.
The dolphins are very intelligent.
Did I disappoint you?
Wait for me to finish, please.
Tom can't help Mary.
He's very happy that his life at school is going well.
Mrs. Young didn't mind me visiting her unexpectedly.
You have good lips.
A lot of people will lose their jobs because of the car industry's bending.
He's coming to my aid.
We'll start the landing down in Honolulu.
I heard you were looking for me.
Our food's over.
The moment of fame for Hanshin didn't last long.
Is there a big house?
Wouldn't that lead to trouble?
He's confused that he's called a fool.
Their condition is getting worse.
Do you really want it?
Is he going to fail at the exam?
I can't understand why he didn't tell the truth.
I'm not a student.
What were the results?
We're finally here!
I'm taller than you.
I think I'm lucky.
Tom could've lied.
I feel good.
She pressed the button.
I didn't feel well, but I went to work.
Are you really happy?
I know what I want.
I have to move.
He's a famous composer.
Tom put a pajamas on the kitchen window to wipe it out.
Happy is the man who married a good woman.
Tom gave me good advice.
He always tells the truth.
I can't live like this anymore.
Ah, how sad!
Say hello to Jimmy.
Is it good for you?
Are you going?
I heard what happened.
Of course, she's right.
Don't make me shoot you.
The equator divides the Earth into two half-cubs.
It was personal.
Doesn't she interest you?
It's a great pleasure for us to watch baseball games.
I think it's good for you to rest a little.
When did you start learning French?
She cut her hair in front of the mirror.
I've already done my job.
It wasn't easy.
Do you think it's gonna rain today?
You're very brave.
There's a bag on the desk.
Where'd you throw them away?
Tom, how do you think he's gonna deal with the problem?
The thief got away with the money.
I haven't talked to you before, have I?
Tom was late for dinner.
This is the picture of my new house.
I want to sleep.
This camera is Tom's, isn't it?
I sent her a doll.
I'm smarter than her.
Uncle gave me the watch.
Please excuse me for being late.
I felt isolated.
I'm busy.
They're very important.
Are you Japanese?
Nancy looks like my sister.
My friend doesn't know.
I know a man who can speak French well.
Move that sweater.
I'd better stay home.
This isn't very fun.
The phone is something you can't do without.
A few days ago, I got in touch with them, but I couldn't get an answer.
Why is your mouth open?
My dad's driving very well.
We need to protect our children.
I'll see you later.
I'm totally exhausted.
I'm just looking at things realistically.
I heard you encourage them.
We know you're not stupid.
Tom didn't like his name.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
In the summer, I'm going to France.
Please mix the cards carefully.
Get on the bus to Badstrace and get down to Zeestrace.
Laughing is good for your health!
That's not a mistake.
I guess you're the Tom that everybody told me about.
Add this site to the Pre-Privacy.
When the sun of culture is low, even the jute throws a big shadow.
When's the museum open?
I saw you somewhere.
He sat on his bench.
We just cleaned the toilets.
Tom and I have a date at the mall.
I'm not going to give up on threats.
You're in a better shape than me.
Do you have a gondola?
I hope it's useful.
He tried it himself.
I'm from the FBI.
Tom works for me.
He's staying up late.
Tom's fine.
I'm walking like a penguin.
Don't change the channel.
Watch your step.
Can I get you a knife?
You have to file a report by the end of this week.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
Are you armed?
I wish you had told me earlier.
Don't look in the camera.
Vali, but we'll go anyway.
Tom and Mary didn't speak French.
I did it once.
He didn't listen to my advice.
There were a lot of people on both sides of the street.
Don't make me regret it.
I thought Tom was gonna cry.
She's her friend.
His clothes always smell.
I want something to eat.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
We're like brothers.
I can't even get the water to boil, can I?
What's the name of this river?
Is she free tonight?
I thought Tom was in love with Mary.
In the winter, the sixies are covered with ice.
We're almost out of time for dinner.
I don't want to be your enemy.
I'm already full-time.
I want to go.
Bring her back!
I'm not telling you to go alone.
I want a orange juice.
I would never lie to you.
I won't be surprised if Tom left earlier.
Tom speaks French as French.
I think we should agree.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I don't have a problem with that.
Where's the ticket box?
I'm really busy.
I think you should go home.
Give me your opinion, please.
I think you'll need this.
I hate flying.
What are the other options?
Get me something to drink.
Am I going to die?
I got a little more sleep while I was dancing, and I went up to the table.
I believe you.
How many brothers do you have?
I think you'll remember that.
Please turn this into a pound.
I think Tom lied to us.
I'm gonna get Tom to smile more often.
I just want to sit on the beach and rest for a week.
I'm thirsty.
The bus was shaking in the wrong way.
Tom has the right to know.
The wind is yours.
She took her exam.
I'll study in the library tomorrow.
I told Tom the truth.
Can't you do it?
I've met him before.
Tom didn't give up.
Tom didn't risk it.
I've made some mistakes on the exam.
This book is not Tom's property.
Where was that?
I have to get him out of here.
Can I do something to help Tom?
Take off your glasses.
You're wasting your time trying to convince him.
She wants to work in a hospital.
Tom's a grown man.
Let's not lie.
I'm fine.
It's not art.
I didn't see you.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
Take one of these.
You're so responsive.
Did you hear about him?
She sent the blouse quickly.
Is there anyone with you?
The museum is open to visitors.
Does Tom really want to win?
My grandfather likes to read.
Did you know you were wearing different socks?
He's making a copy.
What color is Tom's car?
You deserve to be happy, honey.
Tom had only one wish.
Please tell the truth.
Tom went out with Mary on Friday night, and Alice on Saturday night.
Looks like it's gonna work.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
You can't read in French, can you?
That's exactly what I want.
Letter card.
Some of Tom's students speak French very well.
I can't hear anything.
I'd better make sure.
I can't help you.
He got out of the car.
He writes to his mother from time to time
Men get in shape by riding a bike.
This isn't the end of history yet.
Don't rush.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Let's get some rest under the tree.
You can improve your English if you want.
Get me a dry cloth.
Jim's name is James.
Are there any other hotels you can recommend?
This bike belongs to me.
You're kidding me!
More research is needed.
Are you sure Tom's alone?
You'll never be alone.
Is there a similar expression in French?
Are you talking to me?
You're my best friend.
Ann's a little girl.
Just press your fingers.
I went to the park.
I like to play basketball.
The train arrived ten minutes late.
She lives in the deep province.
Excuse me.
I don't have ammo.
You're my best friend.
I've arranged a meeting.
I didn't tell anyone about us.
It was just stupid.
Are you sure?
Have you ever read any French texts?
Ken wasn't running.
I paid the video on five contributions.
I just want to go with you.
She's become twenty-one.
I heard it coming out.
My stomach hurts, Doctor.
You don't understand.
What does that mean?
They come from Sweden.
Watch out when you cross a loaded street!
A man has to work.
That's interesting.
What's your nationality?
That part's good.
Merry Christmas!
Come down.
Mary's in trouble.
They're looking forward to city life.
I'm glad you made it.
The dog was walking around the table.
I'll be in my office.
I think we should call Tom.
It happened between eight and ten hours.
Tom wasn't fat.
We're all friends here.
Are you sure you don't want one?
Tom came in with a letter from Judy.
I heard Tom kissed Mary.
I think Tom gave up too easily.
I heard Tom and Mary discuss it.
Let's eat the sushi.
Throw out those socks if you like.
Please be more careful in the future.
Tom was covered by panic attacks.
Can I open a can?
He was a baseball player.
Don't say such things.
He came after you left.
Did you eat breakfast?
The room is completely furnished.
I admire your courage.
I'll check upstairs.
Tom's on his way to first grade.
Don't stay out too late.
I'm taking a rest day tomorrow.
I didn't even say that.
It's better to give than to take.
Can you take this if you love it?
Jane wrote the letter herself.
Can you handle this?
I think that's enough.
You told me that again.
It's been six years since I started studying English.
I can't buy you this dress.
I work as a bee.
Brian made Kate wait for him.
I forbid you to smoke.
I noticed Tom usually doesn't lock his door.
Would you help me translate this?
Tom almost doesn't understand anything from French.
This is the same hospital where Tom works.
Tom's not that smart.
Why do you want to become a nurse?
Carl looked very happy.
Linda loves chocolate.
This climate feeds on a lot of power.
Don't contact this hunting propaganda.
Tom believes that the death penalty should be lifted.
First the good God made the man, and then the woman. Then he had mercy on the man, and gave him tobacco.
I forgot to lock the door.
Do you like it?
Guys, don't make any noise.
Don't look them in the eye.
I'll be back in an hour or so.
Does that look familiar to you?
Take your coat.
What kind of money do you have?
That won't change anything.
The building's almost over.
I thought they were unemployed.
I'd better get to work.
Aoy's dancing.
Today, machines can do a lot of things for people.
He went for a walk.
Please start right now.
I saw your driver's book.
Where's my room?
Tom suffers from flatness.
Keep digging.
Where's the museum?
"Man's stupidity is infinite," I say, and because of his self-criticalness, I consider myself an exception.
The storm didn't stop. On the contrary, it was getting stronger.
Tom made Mary translate the letter into French.
The unemployment is still high.
Tom thought Mary wouldn't come to the party.
I wasn't talking about him.
Would you like that, Tom?
The whole show goes upstairs.
Aren't you ashamed?
I think you should send Tom to Boston.
Ask Tom again.
I wish things were like they were.
Show me.
Tom got his tooth pulled out last week.
The more you run, the more tired you get.
Don't hide how you feel about it.
Is there anything for me?
Can you open my door?
The girl is Irish.
It'll be a challenge.
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
Tom often gets sick.
The key doesn't go into the key.
What's the minimum wage in Italy?
Tom turned on the lamp again.
This bike is mine.
I'm not used to eating anger.
Choose what you like.
Go over there and talk to her.
We met at a summer camp.
Don't talk in the classroom.
It's not from me.
When my father found out that I was dating Nimrod Nick, he was very angry.
The teacher made us repeat the word.
Tom died yesterday.
I thought we'd have breakfast together.
I think Tom forgot his camera.
I think you'll find it's Tom's fault.
She put on her sweater.
Sometimes my money's over.
Don't worry, Mr. President: with such bad veins, she hardly even has teeth.
I haven't seen you here before.
I think Tom's gonna die.
He lives in a cozy little house.
Go back to bed.
Why don't you try your dress before you buy it?
Tom killed himself, jumping on a rock.
Where were you born?
These clothes are good for you.
They went right to their target.
The boy came in through the window.
I haven't started anything yet.
The bill, please.
I thought you'd be happy.
Are you done with dinner?
I heard Tom gave you his uncle's scarf.
Do what you think is right.
Don't you fall in love with Tom?
Persistence is being paid off.
They arrived separately.
Speaking French is fun.
Tom won't make it.
Get ready for the worst.
I believe the Earth is being watched by extraterrestrial intelligence.
Let's go to the beach.
I think it's a mistake.
My father's going to the park.
You're not that old.
He gave each one of them a prayer.
Don't hold me back.
I think you should let go of your beard.
Do you like French?
Looks like they're ignoring us.
What's going on here?
Are you sure you don't want another alcoholic?
Many people share my view of the matter.
The blouse is clean.
A little tea, please.
I have a stupid question.
He's finished his big start at last.
I have to stay here.
He doesn't need to work.
You just missed the train, didn't you?
The child is not a court that must be filled, but a fire that must be lit.
I think you should see this.
Don't you speak French?
Sort the words in alphabetical order.
Tom can speak French much smoother than I do.
I'll hide in here.
She was taking care of her sick husband.
He played while he was walking.
I saw the girl between the crowd.
I could make you happy.
I can't speak English, but I can't speak German.

He finished Yale with honors in 1921.
I think I have a way to save you some time.
My name is Roberto.
I opened the door and kept it open for Mary.
We make cheese and butter from milk.
How many episodes of One Piece have you seen?
I didn't mean that.
I'm on vacation this week.
If a sick woman gathers a thousand papers of brewing, her desire will come true.
I'm surprised that this building is still standing.
I don't owe you at all!
The bus driver didn't see the pedestrian.
Why did you leave?
I want my shirt back.
I spent my vacation in Hakone.
Take a look at these documents.
I'd like to translate this into French.
He didn't say a word.
They're drinking tea in the lobby.
Tom's on the engine.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Looks like he was a very good athlete.
Give me some milk.
You're about 300 grams of rice.
Isn't that enough for you?
By the way, have you been talking to him lately?
Your bike is better than mine.
I didn't give you permission to leave.
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
Be careful.
How do I get to the airport?
Who took it off?
Money doesn't buy happiness.
We're boys.
Bad weather stopped us from leaving.
Now he's learning French.
Because I didn't know where to go, I asked the bus driver.
Did you get what I sent you?
I'm very busy.
How do you learn to speak French?
Be there tonight.
You're in a winning series.
I can't get mad at you for that.
The spread of television has left us considerably out of our time for reading.
I'll need it forever to explain everything.
Don't fuck with me in the basement.
The new coronation virus is highly infected.
Every time I look for you, you're gone.
You're going down to the next stop.
Wait a minute.
I'm informal here.
Don't look directly at Tom.
Are you sure Tom won't be here by 2:30?
Tom taught me to surf.
He doesn't believe in God.
All I want is a cup of coffee and a toaster.
I need to fix this.
I've prepared breakfast.
He's following English literature.
The knife is stupid.
She looked at me a lot.
It's forbidden to smoke in school buildings.
I'm really tired and I want to go to bed early.
I love you more than anything.
Why did you come so early?
Some people are good listeners, while others are good listeners.
I didn't get the last word.
No matter how rich she is, she's not happy.
Go and see for yourself.
Have you seen my glasses somewhere?
You can meet him.
Close your textbooks.
I heard someone was coming in.
Tom went on his father's way.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
Tom turned to me in French.
He can also speak Russian.
Japan's got a lot of excellent drawings.
Do you believe there's a god?
I'm going out with the dog tonight.
What's your blood group?
Ten houses were burned.
I shouldn't have let you do it alone.
Sentenced to death.
I've been waiting for only five minutes.
Will you show me your photo album, please?
Tom's house burned down.
The greatest happiness in life is to love and be loved.
How hard is your daughter?
Tom shouldn't have done that.
I'm an atheist.
He never writes the words "borch" and "schi" in German!
I went to the market.
Tom's knees were sucked.
I'll come back with you to the hotel.
Give me some milk.
I think she's over 40 years old.
Are you wearing the driver's book?
I don't need your help.
He's at the door.
My business is getting back on track.
The keys are on the table.
I went to the park.
He reported the police crash.
I don't see him.
Do your parents speak French?
I'm afraid you can't talk about promotion now.
You've always been a little weird.
Aren't you afraid?
I haven't talked to anyone today except Tom.
I can hardly hear you.
You don't have to go out.
Can you turn off the light?
He's drinking a mean amount of coffee.
I'm disappointed he's gone.
You're wearing your socks on the wrong side.
We just got information from your brother in Kansas.
I thought I could trust Tom.
I'm studying French.
Is this new model on the market?
Do you know Mr. Brown?
Don't expect anyone to like you.
What's it really about?
Watch out for Tom.
We can't live with 150,000 yen each month.
Stop it.
She got the ticket without giving anything.
Many people think that retro cars are very expensive.
GNP for the third quarter exceeded 1% of the previous quarter.
I'm sorry. I have to study.
I forgot to tell you what to bring.
Can you see anything there?
Everyone was at work.
I'm out of gas.
Let's ask him.
Where's your father?
I'll do it the way you told me to.
What floor do you live on?
Tom was on my bus.
I waited a month.
I have to go meet Tom.
He was forced to sign the contract.
Not as much of the disease as the scar.
Aren't you afraid, Tom?
God is great.
I just feel terrible.
At the end of the movie, she's very different.
Are you sure you don't want to study in my house?
Go back to your bed.
Tom hasn't eaten yet, has he?
My dog's watching TV, too.
Let's get to work.
Are you sure you don't want to come with me?
I'm not crazy.
He's watching TV sometimes.
I have to respect Tom's wishes.
That's pretty extreme.
They'll only be 30 minutes before the train leaves.
The participants are preparing for the final round of the competition.
I have plans for Saturday night.
It's like I'm tired.
I hope we hear soon.
Our coming here was a mistake.
Don't touch us so much.
Her hobby is to collect postage stamps.
I don't understand German.
I think you'd like it there.
I'll be fine.
That Tom won't understand anything.
Don't forget to get your kitchenware like knives and cooking vessels.
We're here.
Where are you going?
We're going to the beach.
I promised myself I'd never do that again.
Jane runs to school sometimes.
I think you'd like that.
I could make you happy.
Every student has a locker.
Have you seen the koala?
Tom can't believe Mary really loves him.
I can't buy you that dress.
I think you panicked.
He went out to go.
I hope you're right.
At least 100 people attended the meeting.
I know you're right.
My plans for vacation failed.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
He came to Tokyo and married her there.
I don't think it's true.
I lost my idea of time.
He thought it might be a number.
He's the greatest poet.
What's your problem?
I'll visit my grandmother at the hospital.
Hell is a place where it smells bad and nobody loves anyone.
Tom wrapped his knee.
Where's the bathroom?
I have to report on this.
You're having a lot of French, aren't you?
He postponed the feast.
Marie said Tom was her cousin.
They caught five peppers.
Do it for me.
"How are you doing, Mike?" "My name is Tom."
What exactly happened to you?
Get the car in the garage.
Are you sure Tom knows what to do?
I saw his father fight.
Keep your room clean and tidy.
I had a hard night.
She didn't like her husband.
I was studying his face for boredom.
Music is the common language of humanity.
Give me some sugar.
I'll take you home.
I wonder if Tom would teach me French.
It would be a pleasure for me to sing for you.
Can you ride a horse?
Tom is very interested in drawing.
Tom's not ready.
Are you alive?
This is Copacabana!
Maybe it's true, but I don't believe it.
I waited as long as I could.
You can't hide from me.
I don't want to be different.
Look how I do it.
We're going to a movie.
He often goes to a movie with her.
You can't smoke in this room.
I heard Tom's membership was over.
I'll be with you if you go and do it.
What's the name of the hotel in Boston you stayed in last year?
That's a complicated problem.
Now it's exactly 10:00.
It's like a glass.
Are you an Ergen, too?
He's known as a great poet.
We're not gonna be here after 2:30.
I saw that Jesse was standing there.
I bought books from the bookstore.
I have to buy one of these.
I like sports.
He's often late.
I wish I had a friend like you.
I speak French every day at work.
I don't believe in coincidences.
He's nice.
I'm still a little busy.
I just couldn't make Tom understand.
He's one of my neighbors.
We're almost done.
I closed my door.
I could make you happy.
I've never seen anything like it before.
Open the bottle if you like.
I'm smarter than you.
The latest innovations in medicine are remarkable.
You have to control yourself.
I'm not interested in doing this.
Tom thinks he's gonna be okay.
Can you speak French?
They wrote it down as lost.
I waited three days.
Material wealth often goes hand in hand with the rejection of society.
Did you count the torso?
You have to find a real job.
You two have nothing to do with it.
Many scientists live in this small village.
I'm sure Tom understands French.
I didn't know we shouldn't.
You're a good singer.
The cat's eating.
I'm used to not paying attention to my parents.
Speaking of trips, have you ever been to Australia?
I thought you'd be tired.
I need to see you.
Nancy looks like my sister.
Tom doesn't like math.
He teaches his children well.
I was just being kind.
Tom's growing tomatoes in his garden.
I like to go fishing.
She gave me access to her records.
Aren't you Tom?
She looks young shy.
It's made by Tom.
You can read French, right?
I'm sleeping a lot.
Be more accurate.
I was on vacation.
No one will understand.
Tom comes out to drink every night.
The museum is closed today.
She gave me the shirt.
Tom didn't put on his belt.
You think you're funny?
That's what you decided.
Where's the library?
The boy put all his clothes in the bag.
Get me the magazines.
She tied him to the table.
I'm young.
The city's big.
He promised me he wouldn't tell anyone.
Did you owe it already?
Will you teach me to speak French?
You're cruel.
Tom's still tough.
The problem seems much more complicated.
Drinking water.
Don't worry.
Tom's not good lately.
I need to tell you something first.
One coffee, please.
I'm a widow.
Did I have another choice?
He's alone.
In China, we put the family first, and then the name.
Give it to him.
The boy was blushing at his father's face.
He always manages to write to his mother at least once a week.
He looked me right in the eye.
Don't stop for me.
How do you distinguish them?
Time's on our side.
Do you love your mother?
They've improved their results.
Don't hit them so hard.
Where's the boss?
When can we say that a person has problems with alcohol?
Is there anyone at the station to meet me?
I haven't heard it in months.
He doesn't play both.
I read an exciting story.
Don't be afraid.
This question is something I understand.
Why aren't you here?
Tom is the man who gave me this bike.
We're not going to burn under the pressure of a tyrant.
Tom's a complete mystery.
I'm wearing sunglasses.
I don't know why Tom's so angry.
I'm so glad to see you again.
Don't make me stay here.
That's food.
Would you overload this?
Who's your favorite bird?
Everyone but me was invited.
I didn't even say that.
He loves geography and history.
Did you come here by yourself?
Do you have any submissives who speak French?
I don't need to talk much in French.
Ask him about the way to the station.
Bill's been fishing all day.
I'm looking for my glasses.
I'm giving up.
My eyes are tired.
The passengers on the bus were fifty.
Tom works in a wine cellar.
Tom had nothing to do with it.
Who's listening to Tom?
I think Tom's asleep.
Children often cry because they want to pay attention.
I'm curious.
Please wake me up at six in the morning.
I feel uncomfortable with her.
We don't want you to feel pressured.
The stems are dried grapes.
I was in India.
Coffee break is a tradition in America.
I told you what I know.
They have another plan.
Life is full of opportunities.
We drove when we changed.
If you want anything, don't hesitate to tell me.
Tom wasn't that bad.
I can't find my glasses.
Are you sure you don't want me to wait here with Tom?
You look tired.
He's playing baseball after school.
The sound of the horrible sand made him shake.
Do you have this shirt in black?
It wasn't a holiday.
I'm ordering her a new dress.
I saw you on TV.
Meg's talking too much.
I've dropped a lot of stuff.
I can't believe my eyes.
There's no room for concern.
We have physical.
Are you having fun yesterday?
This sweater is worth over $50.
Just leave it with me.
I don't like doctors.
Tom refused to speak French.
Tom doesn't make Mary wait too long.
Tony didn't know their name.
That's for Tom.
This is where Tom was born.
My car's in service.
I've got an old bike.
Don't you speak English?
Tom won't let you pay.
Spread your shirts before they get into a fight.
I'll be there.
Don't get too fast.
Why do you know that?
You're a cop.
I just don't want to see you disappointed.
The investment brought him 6%.
Let's have dinner.
I have to get to Tom.
Don't throw them away, then you'll need them.
Who's Tom's girlfriend?
He convinced his mother to give him extra money.
This book was easy.
I fixed his radio.
I'm on the 58th Street.
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Don't let me die here.
I've never seen you so nervous.
I think we should go.
Take off your blouse, please.
I almost forgot it.
Tom can't forget the first time he and Mary had a serious fight.
You're in danger here.
I'll say I did it.
I don't have anything.
If you need help, don't worry about looking for me.
We managed to get some foreign brands.
I laughed.
It's hard to explain.
We got on a trip to Shinjuku.
The police are investigating the case.
You're drinking from my watch.
It was cheaper than I thought.
How's the job going?
I've written a few songs in French.
Nancy loves music.
The phone's a comfort.
Are you selling French newspapers?
Now the service is yours.
I'll be gone tomorrow.
I want something hot to drink.
Tom went there to study French.
I haven't said yes yet.
I barely got along with the world tradesmen.
Don't talk to me.
What did you do with your camera?
Tom's very modest.
Thank you for that.
A bala noc, Turkish panic, oh guide Vancho, our captain.
I'll contact you as soon as I can.
I want to go to the same school Tom is planning to enroll.
The condition of the wounded improves.
We've got a lot of lotus leaves.
We are firmly convinced that when it consists of sentences, the author must avoid succumbing to the harmful habits present in the use of too many unnecessary words, which are actually absolutely excessive in the light of the whole sense.
Tom didn't see you.
Tom said, "Move, make your way and sit down.
I forgot his name.
Is Bob right?
I need to know.
When does it end?
I get it every time I see blood.
Don't!
I thought we'd make it by 2:30.
Tom doesn't think Mary looks like her mother.
I've seen Tom do some pretty remarkable things.
He couldn't pass the exam.
Almost all students love English.
God knows what can happen in an hour!
I fell asleep while I was reading a book.
She's late again.
He wasn't that strong.
I'm not a king.
They made their way through the crowd.
Bring him in.
I doubt Tom will stay.
It's too expensive!
Goodbye!
I think Tom wants to kill himself.
I don't want to sell my soul.
Tom, I have something to tell you.
The police searched the house and found two pounds of heroin.
What color is Tom's dog?
Is this close to your house?
Jane filled out a statement.
I could make you happy.
Why is your French so good?
The fools run where the angels are afraid to stand.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
I've spent my whole life in sports.
I'll eat here.
I love tennis.
Do you allow me in?
Is it hard to learn French?
I've been waiting so long to happen.
Come on!
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
I'm very happy.
You don't have to say things like that when there's kids around.
He pushes easily.
I want to improve my French speech.
You won't believe what I heard.
I'll study Tom.
Today the train is ten minutes late.
Silence has occurred.
Are you sure you want to do this?
She didn't like him.
You learn French, don't you?
I have to go to a meeting.
I hope we find Tom.
Although I know a little French, I think we should speak English.
She's getting better.
What are you doing this weekend?
Aren't you nervous?
I need to talk to Tom now.
Checkmate's not opening.
Try to calm down.
We need to conduct an investigation into the date of the test.
Maybe it's just the obvious.
Everyone dies.
Tom is a monk.
I have faith in you.
I'll listen to your advice.
A few days ago, my computer stopped working.
In Japan, almost every family has a laundry.
We're moving to Boston next week.
The raven flew away.
Will you marry me?
Close your books.
What exactly are you doing, what the scope of your study is, your main interest.
You're shaking.
I'm a little busy.
I thought I'd go say hello to Tom.
I think Tom may be drunk.
I've had a lot of heads.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Mark Zuckerberg is an atheist, not a believer.
There's little chance I can't get to the meeting.
You always said hello with a gift.
How do I know?
Wouldn't you go?
I think you should see this.
He can read pretty well.
Tom's okay, isn't he?
She took it for a while in the paper.
J.F. Kennedy was buried in the cemetery in Arlington.
I'm not giving up.
What are you interested in?
I could make you happy.
Carlos climbed the mountain.
He added some sugar to the coffee.
Give me your shirt.
I'm not taking any medication.
You'll never be alone.
Does he have a big house?
I'm sorry, I don't have much time.
I couldn't understand his ideas.
He knows how to catch his audience.
He'll get to the Hakodate tonight.
I'm not a tourist.
A man has to work.
Hello!
They eat apples.
I got her letter yesterday.
I've been a lot of explosives lately. My favorite soccer team is the West.
I've been very easy to connect to the sweet stories.
Tom didn't know what was wrong.
I know you're right.
I need to know what I saw that night.
I studied French for three years with a language teacher.
That's not my car.
If we don't leave soon, we won't get there until it's still light.
Tom's hurt.
His room's a mess.
They set aside part of their time to take care of the sick.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
I really don't think Tom intends to go.
Ask Tom.
Let go of the radio.
I'll stay three more days.
We delayed the departure for tomorrow.
Nature doesn't know the boundaries.
I'm very happy in Georgia.
I'm busy with different things.
I hear you think I'm crazy.
I'm a musician.
I need to know what the truth is.
If John had come, I wouldn't have to come.
You better put your sweater under your jacket.
I thought you'd be tired.
I think you're an idiot.
How complicated is it?
I heard you laughing.
I totally erased it from my memory.
How can I leave?
You can't enter the museum.
He insisted on his own, even though I told him not to.
I didn't want to hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom's swimming very fast.
Add this site to "Pre-respected".
I have a lot to say on this.
I love my enemies.
I have no idea why.
That's what's got to do with you.
The worst part is that it wasn't always like that.
All the doctor's efforts were empty, and the man died soon.
I noticed you weren't at your house last night.
It's a threat.
You want to buy this pole.
He's a great brain surgeon.
I was right last month.
He can speak French.
Are you leaving?
Let's change the subject.
It was very interesting at school.
They took the library with new books.
I couldn't speak French.
Can I leave now?
Whatever you say, I won't give up.
I've been living in French for the last three years.
I'm much bigger than you.
He only eats fruit.
It wasn't that funny.
Either he or I'm wrong.
You learn French, don't you?
The girl used to play alone.
He's playing in a group.
Birds sang.
Tom's doing his job at 5:00.
Although Tom left home early today, he was late for work.
I'd rather not speak French.
It was scary, wasn't it?
He looks strong.
That's how you feel.
The time will come when she will regret what she said.
Think about it, please.
The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
Did they get by the bus to the museum?
Is he your teacher?
Take care of him.
Be right.
What else do you want me to read?
There's a golden rule: who has the gold, he sets the rules.
The house is inhabited by spirits.
Tom's going to town.
Everything that's not forever is forever old.
You're early again.
Tom got married when he was 30.
I helped Tom do his homework.
Can I help you?
You always disagree with your boss.
I bought it for $10.
You don't have to go.
Tom lives alone in a big house.
Did you go to the beach with Tom?
I don't care.
Did you hear Tom speak French?
It's a beautiful sunset, isn't it?
You really speak French very well.
Say hello to Jimmy.
I heard what you said.
Tom didn't try to hide the truth.
I think you should choose Tom.
Something's going on.
Am I clear?
Many parents worry that their children do not have basic knowledge of numbers.
I graduated from philosophy at my university.
Which beach do you like to go to?
You can always give part of the work of younger servants.
Maybe that's the problem.
She's a very beautiful girl.
Tom can't do it.
Whatever you're doing, you can't make a person believe in something even less than yourself.
I don't feel very well.
The air conditioning isn't working.
You're sitting in my place.
Wouldn't something scare you?
Everyone agrees with you.
Tom encouraged me to learn French.
I want an MP3 player!
Where's Tom hiding?
I'm shaking when I think about it.
I paid two hundred dollars of taxes.
I think you should check under the bed.
That won't happen again.
Because of you, I did it.
Stop or I'll let you know.
We need Tom's help.
She's an atheist.
There's nothing to worry about.
There's something I need to take care of.
I can't accept the invitation because I have another commitment.
When I first met Tom, he couldn't speak French.
I saw Tom do the impossible.
What the hell is this?
Is there anything else I can help you with?
I have no intention of retreating for a little bit of that watch, and not talking to him at all to share with him eventually.
He couldn't get the job.
I think you're gonna do great.
Tom wanted to leave, but Mary wanted to stay a little longer.
I think we have enough food.
I'll be on the next bus.
Mary made some egg sandwiches.
What did you see?
I wash every morning in the summer.
Lock up your shirt.
Read it again.
If I were you, I wouldn't be so sure.
I think you're crazy.
Unfortunately, I didn't make it in time for his speech.
I prefer grapefruits in front of oranges.
This place deserves to visit at least once.
He kept reading the book.
Are you sure you don't want one?
I like that color.
Just take it.
Her sister stared at her shirt.
I told you another time, didn't I?
Why do you keep repeating that there's plenty of time?
I'll see you tomorrow.
I don't want your gold or your silver.
I forgot to close the door.
I'd like a orange juice.
Since I took your book until I left it, I've been turning around all the time, and I'm gonna start reading it one day.
I tried to argue with Tom.
The fighter's tied up for the round.
And that's what I've seen.
The dolphin is kind of a baton.
What color are these?
He searched his son's shoulder.
Tom heard something and wondered what it might be.
Tom asked me to stay.
I don't want to be dragged.
I'm not taking drugs.
I'm dying to see Paris.
On Mother's Day, I gave my mother nineteen flowers.
I think you're absolutely right.
If peace cannot be maintained with honor, it ceases to be peace.
She took over the room with beautiful furniture.
Job calculators can buy at the price of a pair of socks, and thousands of British kids are needed at school, not less than a pen and a tire.
This is the hospital Tom was born in.
You don't have to wait here.
Tom and Mary both covered their eyes.
This is my baby.
I'll give you all the information you need.
Stop kneeling.
You can't just go and do evil to people like that.
Don't open those windows.
I'm not insured.
I'll borrow money.
She's getting ready for college.
I think you're really amazing.
Looks like everything Tom wants is money.
I'm not coming with you.
For the cold time when you want to drink something hot, I recommend this kind of thermos.
Tom ran around like a chicken without a head.
Greece is an ancient country.
Several people visited the meeting.
He wore his coat and got out of the house.
The new site of Tatoeba will pop up a home hyper database, built by the basics searcher, and will go to a tattoo-OS server with a father's CPU, made entirely of tattoo.
The old man stopped her.
She hated being called a coward.
I like it so much.
I've never voted.
Where's the bathroom?
Just go to the room.
I'll be back in time for dinner.
I completely forgot.
She gave me a nice gift.
Are you coming?
Let's meet at 2:30.
The crown is the symbol of kings.
I have no intention of apologizing to Tom.
What are you doing?
During my vacation, I read all the work of Milton.
What are you gonna recommend?
I'm sure Tom didn't even notice you were late.
I'll meet him at the bus stop.
Every student was asked one question.
Are you sure you want me to sell it?
I'm really worried about your future.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I haven't seen you around here before.
It's hot today.
Don't rush to protect me.
Who's Greece's capital?
Tom can't speak French, Mary can't speak French either.
I met her for the first time in London.
Can Tom come tomorrow?
Look where you're going.
They described the girl as a bit.
Tom didn't get used to city life.
Keep your promise.
I forgot about that.
I think you're making too much sugar.
Do you like Mexican food?
I'll take you home.
Man's the only animal using fire.
All the flowers in the garden blew up.
They made us work all day.
We chose him as president.
No jokes?
I've seen these pictures.
If I hadn't noticed, I'd have told you.
What's the minimum wage in Luxembourg?
His fate is predestined.
Are those candles?
If you have to choose between piano and brick, what would you choose?
The answer is true.
I think that's great.
Did he pass the exam?
Don't miss the bus.
Be careful not to break Tom's heart.
We went there for a week.
That's good.
This kind of thing is scary.
I think it's better to go to bed.
I like you so much.
I called the phone.
The wolves are moving on the mussels.
Do you have medical insurance?
Watch out, Tom!
The museum's closed on Sunday.
I've been teaching Russian for three years.
We're married to each other.
Tom won't give up.
It'll be about 10,000 yen.
Tom speaks French as well as Mary.
How hungry are you?
That guy's stable.
I almost won.
That wasn't my fault.
Did you cut the paper?
I don't care what happens.
I saw you with Tom.
Tom's my friend.
You're getting into this in the wrong way.
Something's going on.
Fill it in.
We have a little chance of success.
Let's go ask her.
I can only wonder if this is the same for everyone else.
Are you sure you want to throw it away?
Tom speaks French.
The situation has improved its sensitivity to what it was.
I played you.
His joke was great.
The police will investigate the crime.
The stories you will read in this book deal with some of the many problems young people face.
I've been waiting a long time for this moment.
Can you explain a little bit more?
Is it wrong?
Tom didn't want Mary holding his hand.
I think we should study things.
So we all agree.
If time permits, I'll go to the museum.
That tie is really good for you.
I think you'll be a great father.
There's no way to contact him.
Never give up, never give up.
Would you show me that bag?
That's my computer.
Bern is the capital of Switzerland.
You won't believe me.
Can you come at nine?
Let's synchronize the clocks.
I shop every morning.
I wish I could speak French like you.
Please don't do this.
Is this a free shop?
I'm looking for a gift for my friend.
And if I had told you, Kel fida.
This is the camera Tom took the pictures with.
Make sure you don't lose.
It's freezing me to change my plans every time you decide you want something else.
It looks like a man far away.
We worked hard to tie both ends.
Good morning.
John's grandmother died after a long illness.
I have to get some rest.
She said she wouldn't move an inch, no matter who told her.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
The respondent was given the right to appeal.
Let's not rush.
My father went fishing.
They didn't offer me anything to eat.
You don't have to make quick conclusions.
Don't worry.
He gave up.
Wine is the milk of adults.
Tom opens the windows every morning as soon as he enters his office.
I can't work with you if you don't trust me.
That was years ago.
I'm dreaming nightmares.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary was missing.
I've seen these pictures.
I'm as strong as you.
I've never been to Europe.
I'm unemployed.
Why don't we take a cab?
I hope I'm not too late.
I went home with the train.
Why are you always so mean?
Oui!
That's why you didn't want to come with me?
Did you decide what you wanted to order?
I shut the boy down deep asleep.
She used to call him.
Are we capable of that?
My sister's name is Patricia.
I should have opened my suitcase.
We've discussed whether to cancel the reservation.
The kids thought their parents were made of money.
The swimmers were piled up from the cold.
It's allowed for dogs.
The kids are the flowers in our lives.
I had to cancel the invitation because I was sick.
Tom wouldn't be so stupid.
They hated Tom.
Keep moving.
It's a challenge for me, and I'm learning a lot.
Tom was bored.
I've been counting on her.
Don't look at Tom.
I have to pay for him.
I want to marry you.
Calm down.
This is one of the fish Tom caught.
All right, let's go.
There's a car coming.
Looks like we're gonna make it in time.
Being a troll is art.
I ordered you a beer.
I haven't seen him in about three years.
Let's play baseball.
She's a bodybuilder.
The man ate bread.
He's flooding the river.
You don't remember, and I'll never forget.
I wonder why I'm so tired.
Please give my regards to your family.
When someone in the middle sent a message to a bottle, it was just a childish fantasy. When Christopher Columbus sent a message to a bottle, the fate of the whole country was placed on a map.
Are you sure you don't want to help me?
I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble.
The kids are playing doggyball.
It's snowy.
I want you to clean your room.
I tried to be human.
What's the plan, Tom?
Thank you for your support in advance.
Let's not talk about this anymore.
Her condition continues to improve.
Do Tom really want me to go to his party?
I'm not tired at all.
Most people think I'm crazy.
How many museums have you visited?
I waited as long as possible.
He slipped into the room without taking off his coat.
I went shopping last Saturday.
It's June 18th today, and Muriel's birthday.
The way he works shows nothing to be praised.
We don't see things the way they are, the way we are.
She knocked the door a little bit.
Come on, when you're comfortable.
Alexander wrote a few Berber sentences.
I think you only care.
What exactly happened to you?
Then I visited a museum for the first time.
Is she staying at the hotel?
I don't like this jacket.
Tom and Mary went down the stairs together.
