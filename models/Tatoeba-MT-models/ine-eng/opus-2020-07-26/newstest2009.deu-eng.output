The Prague Stock Exchange breaks down against business closure.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal daily business.
The Prague Stock Exchange just before the start of Tuesday's business began on the break-in of Monday, when it dropped by another six percentage points.
This time, the reason for the break-in was the Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, the response of the market to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilization plan for the financial sector.
Case of shares in Asia
A dramatic case on Tuesday experienced the shares at the stock exchange in Asia, although the indexes could offset some of the losses during the day.
The index of Hang Seng Stock Exchange in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but later it was able to offset some of the losses, thus reducing the decrease to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprise index, which monitors the movement of Chinese shares at the stock exchange in Hong Kong, fell by 3.8%, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The shares at the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then lost to 4.3 percent.
The stock exchange in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent after the index.
"The timing for the rescue operation in the United States is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide," said the head of the monetary authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong determines, although it belongs to China, its monetary policy itself, so independent of the Chinese central bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong are moving at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the US legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft for financial support.
Otherwise, other countries would be affected by the break-in.
A Blood Bath of American Shares
On Monday, the US House rejected the financial support plan for which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 billion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators ignored the call of President George Bush to support the plan.
Bush's view would regulate the underlying causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilise the entire economy.
The American shares experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the most important stock indices recorded the biggest break-in in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven percent, and a similar break-in was last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was hardly any sign that the draft would not pass through in the House of Representatives, the index had a free case.
Congress grants: US government can pump 700 billion dollars into banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
This will be agreed at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators reached a breakthrough in negotiations on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial aid for the US financial system of 700 billion dollars (about 12 billion dollars).
However, this does not mean victory yet.
In other words, the Congressional Members must discuss a few more details of the agreement before they can publish the final text of the Act and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated at the US Congress on Monday.
This was said on Sunday by the chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, of the Reuters Agency.
In the Senate, according to different information, it could probably be agreed on the plan earlier on Wednesday.
According to economists, the plan should be adopted as the first important psychological factor for the survival of financial markets.
But then there is a "refuge" due to the complicated mechanisms, how to help the markets in practice too.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have explained our different views on how a package for the stabilisation of the market should be viewed," said Mrs. Nancy Pelosi to the Agency Bloomberg.
According to your words, there could still be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislator met on Sunday night with US Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for the purchase of unsaleable mortgage assets by financial corporations that threaten financial firms in serious losses and the stability of the entire system.
"We stand on the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue the health plan, but I think we are on target," said Paulson.
A signal for Asia business
The global financial crisis is also strikingly down in the stock markets, which are falling heavily.
According to the words of the democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislator was trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday at the Congress.
This is why it is necessary to reassure investors in the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a congress decision could affect the business on Monday.
Until now, however, it is not quite clear when both chambers of the American Congress are voting on the law, and it is also unclear whether the negotiations in the last minute could not fail with a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
But there will be some changes to the law.
The total amount of aid for the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars will be provided as soon as possible as President George Bush asked.
But the Congress can block the expense of the rest of the money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, at another 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush welcomes progress in negotiations
Although the President has a veto in this decision, the Congress can vote for his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme remains, based on which funds for the purchase of bad mortgage securities, whose value has fallen, are to be obtained because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, then on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The US President Bush was also pleased with the progress.
His speaker, Tony Fratto, explained that Bush was satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "estimate the mutual effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Constraint end timer:
The chairman of the Banking Committee of Senator Christopher Dodd, the leading trader, informed the legislators that they had agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law also limits the so-called gold case screens for directors of companies involved in the programme and sets up a committee to oversee the fund.
This will be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it and have made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also counts with help for homeowners who have problems with the repayment of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates on mortgages that it purchases, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for the debtors and enabling them to keep their houses.
Marek: Psychological Help
The proposed plan is based on the main name of Patria Finance David Marek as a good idea, but implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's why you don't know which mechanism and at what price the problem assets are purchased.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government share losses," Marek told the iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of next week, it is not in the opinion of Mareks.
"It is much more important that the Congressional Members agree to support the plan and that they adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that it comes to an agreement is at this point the most important," said Marek.
Due to knife cutting: MP3 player against phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every mobile MP3 file can play, no MP3 player can call yet.
That's why, of course, it looks like it's better to just buy a phone.
In spite of all this, there are sufficient reasons why you should be a independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims to the future owners.
It is certainly difficult to buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical news does not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is also no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with Type Rock, Jazz or Blues in the regal, you probably dream of at least one of these.
Thus it is also expressed with music on travel, so with compressed music, simple - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories.
For one it may not be acceptable to issue eight thousand crowns for a player, but a Pink-Floyd fan is likely to have heavy headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space.
The selection is wide-ranging.
The life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what phones can do doesn't even make sense.
No modern device is to be used as universally as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the phone and the simsen, it can play music and videos, both capture, it has a better, a worse camera and may also navigate.
And if you even involve the smartphones and the comms, you have almost a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little wonder, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV photo.
But the universality of phones also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your phone, the more often you will have to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy fibers.
Only a few phones can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, usually it's much less.
In this respect, Music Player (especially the simplest) is significantly more powerful.
That's why you should count on the cheap phones so they can't play music for more than a few hours.
If you're still on the phone, you'd better buy yourself another charging device for the office - that's also true for more expensive devices.
In MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good hold at least 9 hours uninterrupted operation with one upload.
There's another problem if you want to play the music on the phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices has a USB shutdown, and not every phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can play the music directly on a storage medium, but only a few card reader devices will be finished without reduction with the small memory cards used in phones.
In the case of players you do not need special software until exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most phones and players themselves use a music library, sorted by the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the rating by users.
Some devices only form the tree structure of the address list, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, phones can more
In selecting a specific device, you should examine yourself, especially after the life of the battery, storage capacity, quality and type of sound, and of course also the operating comfort.
If music is especially cool for you and you only hear it every day in the street, for example, then there's enough phone to play the MP3 files.
That's what almost every cell can do.
You don't even have to check which music formats can handle a phone or a player.
MP3 will create everyone, and most of the music you get will be in this format.
The format is one of the most widely distributed, and in addition most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that uses Apple and its iPods).
Better phones also allow the purchase of music online.
You only need to call the corresponding pages of a provider (or other provider) via mobile Internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can already be an argument for making a musical handy for itself.
Unfortunately, the offer of the suppliers is bad and usually only limited to fast radio attacks.
The prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, this kind of sale of music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) is expected to dominate the music industry in the future.
The phone's most of the time.
If you like to listen to something, pick up the phone in the pocket while the player forgets to be at home.
However, it is clear whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless speech device.
If not, you can go back to the integrated speaker with almost every phone, but only the smallest MP3 player.
The most likely advantage of the musical handys will be for many in the price.
The cheapest costs normally less than three thousand crowns.
For three and a half thousand crowns, you already get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most that there are no normal headphones.
The best and technically sophisticated phones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The player's advantage is in the light operation.
The easiest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity with the previous normal tape recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
There is no conflict in the form of an improperly used mobile Internet and then an alarming bill for data transmissions.
Which device should be picked up now
Also the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are sufficient.
But be careful.
In the base models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive can also read 8-GB memory cards.
If you already have a phone and want to buy another valuable MP3 player, then grab Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
You are among the most demanding listeners, you prefer to take specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate buttons for MP3, and the comfort of the controls comes to the individual MP3 players.
At the most, here is Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) provide you with MP3 players from the above manufacturer.
The first virtual provider is already coming to Czechia this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite well equipped, and the Czech suppliers offer virtually all services, as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
However, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic to lower prices.
Perhaps this will not be allowed to wait any longer.
The fact that the Czech mobile service providers are working at the most expensive in Europe is often reported on mobile.cz.
This was confirmed by the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price for an SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission in the regulation of roaming charges, it is likely that there will be a paradox situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really makes a fight.
Maybe it sounds paradox, but there are three mobile networks in the Czech Republic and a penetration of far more than 100 %.
On the other hand, mobile operators are happy to see that there is an extremely high level of competition on the Czech market.
The President of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) is often obliged to assist Pavel Dvořák, who in the past often expressed that there is no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is likely that a classic provider with its own network no longer has many opportunities (by the way, it would probably not even find frequencies).
But there is another possibility - a virtual provider.
In particular, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile phone market led to a significant price reduction, which the traditional mobile phone providers had to react to.
Before the entry of such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile there were similar voices on the market in the United Kingdom as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
Besides, you don't have to look for examples for long.
In February we reported on the start of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus rise to the fifth largest provider in the country.
Behind Mobilking is Penta's financial group, which has U:fon, among other things, in the Czech Republic.
The benefit of virtual providers is that one can focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers are usually seen as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, however often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers at least half cheaper SMS than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to set a non-climate target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is hard to say whether a similar concept could occur in Poland as well as in the Czech Republic.
It also doubts the press speaker of Vodafone Miroslav Čepýk: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is moderated from the point of view of the service offer."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, the mobile phone providers
But it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile phone provider conquers Czech Republic, this will not be mobile.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look very hopeful.
It will come rather to a market entry of Mobilking in other countries of our region," says Jana Studnikková, spokesperson for the Penta Group of Finance.
Indirectly, she confirmed that the current mobile service providers in the Czech Republic are not only entitled to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can to ensure that there is no potential competitor.
Its interest at the start of a virtual mobile provider has long been shown by the GTS Novera group, which wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the business sector.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed networks, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this option with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we were able to make progress in the negotiations," said the press speaker of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
Maybe better times come now.
Non-official information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this point, we do not assume that there is room in the Czech Republic for a fully-fledged virtual provider.
The Czech market has great specifications in relation to other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area," says Vlastimil Sršeň, in his statement on Mobil.cz from the press department of Telefónica O2.
Other suppliers also point to the specificities of the Czech market.
The press speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds, in rare accordance with the O2 statement: "We have not yet found a viable and mutually beneficial project on which to build further."
And she adds: "In the network of T-Mobiles, hardly a virtual provider will appear by the end of the year.
At this point, we had to have a specific offer to think in such a short time."
Vodafone focuses more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepýký says: "For negotiations with potential virtual providers, we are open, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
This is precisely what we see from the customer's perspective as the best.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is to seek a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
Responsibilities - with the suppliers hand in hand
The mobile provider's behaviour is easy to understand, another provider called more competition, which would lead to lowering prices and thus also to a fall in profits.
Why, then, should such a competitor be made market entry easier?
The fact that the providers can draw on a string when it comes to something also indicates the long time and time for the creation of U:fon.
The most powerful pressure in the direction of ČTÚ went to the time when U:fon came to the market, from the company T-Mobile.
This is also evidenced by the publicly available information from the ČTÚ website.
Now, however, U:fon is only suitable as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competitive environment of the mobile phone market has recently been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile phone provider.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile radio market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and in particular on his services."
However, in view of this approach by mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not just the attitude of the Czech Republic, which unfortunately - unlike Britain and other highly developed countries - does not have the power to intervene in economic competition.
It has only the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
But this related to this whole problem his very typical attitude.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile provider would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile provider and a virtual provider on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not interesting enough for the classic providers," according to our request Kristian Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS.
The representatives of the supplier would not be surprised by such a formulation.
From an authority representing consumer interests and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses his position on the market, this is more than worrying.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country where virtual providers normally work, it is to be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, it is likely that the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction does not belong to the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, it is truly shocking that the almost already moving harmony of the three mobile operators is derived from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is at hand.
Just as the absolute same fuel price at the tanks is certainly only a coincidence and the result of a hard competition struggle.
"The Authority has not discovered any signs in this matter which indicate any action directed against competition, and therefore it has no reason to intervene in any way on the matter.
None of the providers have a dominant market position, so neither does he have the corresponding increased responsibility for his actions on the market.
The necessary instruments for opening the mobile phone market for virtual providers are probably also missing from the regulatory authority for telecommunications," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by the ČTÚ, since telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition is a single market.
On such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators have a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - for the market entry of a virtual provider, the consent of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile phone provider - logically - has the monopoly for its network.
This means that he is necessarily taking a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if you do not agree with this argument, it should be at least a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators will be acting in a similar manner.
Complaints from a number of stakeholders (including the company GTS Novera mentioned above) are evidenced by the very similar obstacles encountered in negotiations with all suppliers.
The abolition of responsibility for ČTÚ is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications services, which distances the ÚOHS from the whole issue.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to implement the recently adopted telecommunications bill's novelty to extend CTU's competence in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know this very well, but they probably have different interests.
It's okay if no one's looking.
The operation of any pseudovirtual provider, of which there are also several in the Czech mobile networks, remains disregarded.
There are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but are only partially public.
This is usually the case for companies operating in the area of multi-level marketing.
Own mobile telephone services provide, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies are usually only selected.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears to be a classic company company that orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, it then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar type of resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it may be an infringement of the contractual conditions with which we will then be engaged, which can lead to the termination of cooperation with the company concerned," Martina Kemrová answered our question about this problem.
It is quite unlikely, however, that such a thing does not happen to the operators of mobile phones.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, thousands of customers may be involved.
However, no operator opposes such action.
These companies do not pay too much attention to the activities of the companies, while at the same time, unlike actual virtual suppliers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepýk points out some problems: "The law allows for such types of speculation, however, the services of these companies are only used by a very low percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card does not run in their phone name, so they cannot have complete access to it as the normal customers of mobile phone providers."
However, this was to be at least unusual for the CTU.
There is also another question for the ÚOHS.
Do mobile service providers close their eyes before such a move, why do they block a virtual service provider?
It is added that the ÚOHS has very strong competence to detect such activities, and if it does not, it does not have to satisfy itself with the supplier's statement, they knew nothing about it and their business conditions would prohibit this.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As already emphasized in the text several times, the market entry of the virtual provider brought a significant drop in prices for the various services.
In this way, virtually all countries where virtual providers have been created have tried to prevent their origins from being virtually more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - a small, or very strong market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, at this moment, regulatory bodies are involved, not in the interests of mobile operators, but in the interests of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and further followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators throw themselves at the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot give the impression that uncertainty in the skills in these cases is more than favorable.
But we don't throw the flint into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider appears soon, the Czech mobile phone market may be moving again soon.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile phone provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting other interests (to discriminate).
And then the Czechs will finally no longer call more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech Hymne has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech National Hymne.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented on the occasion of the day of the Czech State in a festival the new recordings of the National Gymnasium Where is my home country.
The Hymne was again recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
Four versions are available - with male or female solosong, in corps and in an instrumental version.
The song was taken by Katerína Knězzynková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the Hymnna versions are Otakar Jeremáš and Jaroslav Kreček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions at once.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
Earlier he had told the Czech radio, he selected young, representative voices for the solo variants of the singer, who are marked and popular.
"From the beginning, I have tried both, and then also with the choir, to keep a clear statement so that you can understand the text well, so that a harmony can be formed," said the director.
The Czech National Hymne will begin its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde homev můj sang for the first time in 1834 at the stage of the stage theatre in the original Czech piece Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music came from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first strofe of the song then became an organic part of the National Hymne after the birth of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven symbols remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
Who sounds the "new" Hymne
The Prague transport companies move for the first time on Wednesday also on a chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, Prague transport companies will enter the history as a date on which the first passengers will enter a subway, road or bus carrying an electronic coupon in the bag instead of a paper licence.
These can now be purchased by about one hundred thousand people who own the chipcard Opencard.
The passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or an annual coupon (as of 1 January 2009) and play on their chip card at the same time, in the info centres and branch offices of the transport companies at the U-Bahn stations Museum, Můstek, Nadraží Holeshovice, Andelj, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons have also been available on the website of the transport companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was made available to over four hundred customers until the afternoon.
Those who use the internet can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they had to wait regularly in long chains for their paper tickets.
They buy the coupon via the Internet, it is played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"In these places the travelers also have a switch with trained staff, who advises stakeholders on the purchase of the internet and also plays the coupon on the map," said the speaker of the Martin Opatrny project.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons on the open-card self-control machines that are placed in some subway valves.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, remember the traffic lights, the passengers may already have noticed in the bus stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five of them in the city until the end of the year, but there are eighty," adds Opatrny.
The coupon controls an auto instead of the driver
The operation of the automatics that will work from tomorrow is easy.
You just have to enter the chip card, and the coupon you bought before is playing on your own.
The electronic coupons are not only valid from tomorrow in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburbs and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants from the municipalities of the region reached the capital.
"In the trains that belong to Prague integrated traffic, the train drivers have the devices with which they can check the validity of the coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization. This organisation brings together the roadmaps for Prague transport companies.
The front city buses have card reader devices on the box at the driver.
When entering, the chip card must not only be shown on the driver, but the open card must be placed at a designated place on the side of the box.
This controls the validity of the played coupons.
"If a driver wants to check the validity of the played coupons, nothing is easier than asking the driver to ask for this information," Drápal said.
A driver who does not drive with pre-City buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupons ends can also go to the self-service machines where the coupons are played on the card.
The information on the validity of his documents on the display of the device is shown here.
The South asked the United States for a national decision.
In 1945, the Soviet Germans had sought to join the Böhmerwald in the United States.
This is illustrated by a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the United States of America.
With such a wish, a number of groups of Germans were to turn to the U.S. presidents in 1945.
This comes from, among other things, a letter that has been kept in a private archive and which is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
The Germans of Krumau ask the US President in his letter, he should not allow the return of the "Southern Gauss" - which was adopted on the basis of the Munich agreement of Hitler - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to make sure that the American units do not enter as oppressors and enemies German territory, but as freemen," says a letter signed with the words "People to whom the fate of the South is at heart".
Since the accession to Czechoslovakia - in the knowledge of the Czech national character - suggests that they would expect brutality, indifference, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the President of the United States to take over the protection of the Bohmer forest today and forever.
"We cannot believe that you, regardless of the opinion of a quarter million inhabitants of this area, are referring to a foreign state that has oppressed and tried to eliminate minorities and has not contributed anything to the victory of the Allieds," is to be read in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is apparently the fear of the "Czech Underpressors" rachel leaves.
If the U.S. President has doubts about the thinking of the Böhmerwald Germans, it would be sufficient if he would initiate a national decision in Böhmerwaldgau on whether the inhabitants of the United States become part of the United States or wanted to live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter in today's knowledge of post-war history may sound somewhat naive, it is, in the opinion of some historians, a good image with regard to the expectations of the Germans at that time.
Even though the Bohemian Germans had to at least recognize that they would be negotiated on their departure from the Republic, only a few of them had such a possibility at all.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the South.
Others believed they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was used in the war as Budweiser Deutscher at the Marine at the Baltic Sea.
When he came to British prison at the end of the war and was brought to Holstein in a prison camp, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to bring them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, they would get the Czech," says Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived before the war in Czechoslovakia thought that they would distribute it from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
You don't think so.
An emotional campaign is aimed at drivers
Most expensive action on the streets in Czech history.
This is also how the emotional-loaded media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday, was characterized.
The authority of Minister Aleš Rébíček promises to take drivers of dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on TV, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to stop drivers from driving too fast and alcohol at the tax.
And they also remind themselves to stand by before the entrance.
The campaign aims, in particular, to talk about young drivers, motorcycles, pedestrians and not least professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
Of this, the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign also proves:
You don't think so.
The words "don't think" are on a sign sign in capital letters.
And in a blood lacquer, the word "pay".
This should mean that one can pay for a moment of carelessness with his own life.
The spots will "shock" the spectators by 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the English countries, where you can see normal images with dramatic images of victims of accidents.
It is promised that the number of accidents and the number of traffic accidents will fall on the Czech streets.
The spots were compiled by Euro RSCG.
Sugar beet and peits for drivers
"For drivers, the motto of sugar beet and peits is valid.
It means that they save time when they drive to red, for example.
The scourge is then the threat of a punishment or an accident.
The driver needs to be reminded of the risk," says the traffic psychologist of the Hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that's why information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising are necessary, says psychologist.
Even less effective is his opinion on tables that make drivers aware of a danger.
"If you set up a static table that warns against a danger, it will probably soon run away with the environment, and the drivers will no longer see it," Korřán says.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The President of the provisional Israeli Government, Ehud Olmert, spoke for the return of virtually all the areas occupied in 1967, namely Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, when peace with Palestine and Syria could be exchanged.
He stressed this in an interview that was printed on Monday by Jediot Acronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," said Olmert against the newspaper.
"We retain a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar high percentage (Israeli) because there will be no peace without this," he added.
He acknowledged that any return would also include Oster Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want tractors or bulldozer to roll over his legs as one of my best friends has to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in referring to two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temples and holy and historical places" located on the territory of the old city.
"The one who wants to maintain Israel's sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he continued.
Deduction of Golan Height
Olmert spoke of a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which he considered to be an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some efforts on the sides of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to close alone with Syria and alone on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan-high peace," Olmert confirmed.
"The Syrians only know too well what they have to give up in order to get back the Golan heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the (Shitical) Hisbollah movement; they will have to give up the constant support they give to the (Shitical) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terrorist network and the Dshihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions about the accident: Are Stewards on the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know her, in a remote bus the rerun is not allowed
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question is whether Stewards and travelers can get on and off the bus while travelling.
"If we wanted to adhere strictly and formally to the law, the activity of a Steward is contrary to the road traffic law," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, in the last week of a twenty-two-year-old Stewardness, was probably caused by the truck driver who crossed the bus.
The young woman was at this point in all the accident next to the driver, in which she had at least a safe place in the car, although she had two more seats.
But a bus can also have an accident at the moment or a sharp brake in which the Steward brings coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role in whether the bus is equipped with the vehicle’s letter even with parking places.
If this is not provided in the bus, the passengers must be seated.
The Student Agency’s remote travel buses do not have parking spaces; what the company’s director, Radim Janchura, confirmed, compared to Aktuálně.cz.
"We have discussed this with the Ministry, and this first did not agree with the movement of travellers.
Later, this has been withdrawn, and we have reached a consensus that travellers can go to the toilet during the trip if they have their seat," he told his position.
The law doesn't know a Steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a Steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legal provision prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the term 'vehicles'; however, it does not define the rights and obligations', says Hanzelka's spokesman.
On the other hand, the Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorny, believes that the law subsequently covers this problem.
"It is clear whether the bus in the product authorisation also has parking places.
That's all," he stresses.
Buses are divided into busses where there are parking places and the maximum speed is limited, coaches with coaches and a higher permitted speed and coaches without parking places with the highest permissible speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
Like in the plane, the expert says
The BESIP traffic safety expert Jaroslav Horín does not see a fundamental problem in Stewards' movement on board a bus.
"In the case of a liquid journey, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Also here is not safe when turbulence comes, and the Stewardness can hit its head."
"But if a bus is sharp, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a road.
The safety of the Stewards must be clarified by internal regulations," he says and also believes that this problem is not completely resolved from the point of view of the law.
Janchura is ready to provide the services
Student Agency offers Stewards services as the only bus company.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The Director does not consider his profession to be risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that Steward's profession is risky, I'll take it away.
Coffee and newspapers can be obtained by travellers when entering.
That would also reduce the costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexey Litvin explains the lack of Stewards in his bus. But his company only operates a fraction of lines compared to the student agency.
"We don't have any stewardess, but we've been defending ourselves from the beginning.
Earlier or later this ends with some fatal accident," he had not spoken for Týden.cz a year ago.
That was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a line bus to Naples, a young Stewardess from the Pilsen region was disappointed who had worked for the company for two years.
The Slovene truck was probably bent off the stand-bar and had blocked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to escape a sharp manoeuvre, but collided with the right advantage with the truck.
That the two seats for the Stewards were sold, Janchura argues.
"These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked."
The company wants to expose the LKW professionals.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the judgment, but a financial compensation is also expected from the debtor.
A change of law?
Not in View
A more accurate regulation of the movement of Stewards on board a bus could bring a legal regulation where a thirty-six-six expert team of the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"But this has not yet come to a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones when driving," says Fachmann Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider Stewards' activities to be something that could seriously endanger the safety of passengers," says Hanzelka, where the security of buses in the competence of the police and the employment protection authorities is controlled.
Düsseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
In large words, there is no lack of staff in the letter of the WestLB board.
By combining units of the Düsseldorf Money Institute with the Frankfurter Deca Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finance Group" can be created, it is said to be written on Monday.
The WestLB incorporates a "competence block" with sustainable yield power into such a business.
And at all times such a connection of the decisive attack on further mergers in the banking sector could be.
This is how it is read when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a difficult time.
Because the hit WestLB is still under heavy pressure.
Not only since the EU Commission, but also through the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Office, which the North Rhine-Westphalia Government has just made it clear that it is time to find a future solution.
From a connection as always known between the Deca bank, the savings customers know because of their investment funds, and the WestLB has been speaking for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
Even though Deka-Bank-Chief Franz Waas had known in the presentation of the half-years at the end of August, in a merger of the house on Mainzer Landstraße with a country bank, such as Helaba or WestLB, he did not see any sense.
However, the Governing Council of Deca, which is held in half by the Land Banks and Stock Exchanges, has instructed the Management Board to conduct discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
It could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks are free, as it is called in the financial square, just started.
From the Deca bank, which among its 3,000 employees is the most important employers in the finance sector in Frankfurt, it is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it looked as long as the Deca bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba.
However, nothing came out of this triangle.
The plans had hardly been made public, the Hessian government expressed its opposition to the participation of Helaba.
And the other two houses did not find one another.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there have always been games of thought about a connection between the Deca bank and state banks.
However, Günther Merl, Chairman of Helaba's Board, had recently spoken against planning to join his house.
Regardless of this, however, it seems to be true that there is a need for a collapse of the different houses of the public-law sector.
After the country day election in Bavaria has passed, the first thing the BavarianLB could do is to get closer to the Baden-Württemberg Landesbank.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily a good message.
If the pressure goes up to further mergers, you'll go back and forth to the partners for it.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, although she has had a far better financial crisis than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, in conjunction with the West LB, the Garkassen-Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which is 85 percent involved in Helaba, has set a row in the beginning of the year.
Stay the North LB anyway.
Such geostrategic considerations are, however, only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of individual houses fit together.
In June Merl expressed the crucial question of which business model to ensure the future of the banks was not answered by the German Sparkassen and Giroverband.
In the end, there could also be a breakdown of the West LB, which is not rightly desired there.
This is also the case in the letter of the Board of Directors to the House, in any case seeking a "total solution" for the house.
How to bring it under a hat with the merger of individual units with the Deca bank will still show up.
The second weekend is known as "Italian weekend"
For Elena it's the first time, for Luca the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena's like his girlfriend with her, and then everything's different, he says.
Behind them, at the 5 litre beer fiber of the brand Kaiser, stands a massively built carrier and proves the approximately 200 Octoberfest travelers, which deep tones can produce his throat.
Elena's just giving Luca a tap, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus park next to the Puorta Nuova train station, will start at 23.45 a.m. four buses, "Destinazione Monaco, Festa della birra", arriving expected 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are reserved mainly for Italians, only Brazilians travel on a bus.
In an corner of the parking lot, the South Americans already sing next to their flag, they've celebrated already at night.
And so says Marco Guarda, it's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat of fur and a glasses with wide silver bends, belongs to the bus.
For five years they've been going to the October party, three tours are alone this year.
Night to night, day to day on the beach, at 2:30 p.m. back.
Last night would only mean unnecessary food, says Marco.
75 Euros costs the ride, the welcome drink with Kaiser beer, faithful to the Bavarian offer of cleanliness, the health insurance and the German-speaking travel guide - Marco has visited a language course - including in Frankfurt.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the highway towards "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
Soon it will be quiet in the bus, the travelers sleeping.
Well, they'll still need their powers.
It is held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where there are also several other buses with Italian signs on the 8th motorway just before Munich.
Finally, when Marcos Group arrives in the early half-seven hours at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese, they are already on the other 50 buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final address, explains the attack plan.
First: Set up the yellow button.
On the left is "Oktoberfest", in Fracture, including the internet address of Marcos Travel office: "conscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the doors go up to the beer store, it's running!", Marco calls in in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not before, otherwise we block, and not all yellow mites on the same benches, distribute in the room!"
The size, brown Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget your drinking money.
"The security people show that we're doing well!
When you leave the villages, they will be gone."
Third, "Today evening, point eleven is found here again!" Understand?
And it's going to be fair.
On the way, a yellow hat binds as landmarks to the trees, to paintings and even to the electoral poster of a large Bavarian folk party.
You want to be armed for the retreat.
It's the second weekend, known as the "Italian weekend".
There are no precise figures; the talk is 50 000 who are on the way over the Alps and fall into beer beers, ten percent of all visitors are to be extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven South Tyrol policemen, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads to a national statistics, in which the Italians present British (about 60) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical supplies in the first place.
Especially popular with Italians is the yard.
Sleepless Nights for Believers of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, Minister of Finance Pierre Steinbrück stressed only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relatively" and even suggested that the German banking sector would not be eliminated from the crisis.
Because this is now the weekend.
The Münchner Real Estate Financer (HRE) noted in Dax receives a billion credit from a consortium of German banks to shield themselves from the turbulence in the markets.
One person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate had to only shrink the part which it would also claim.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
There are losses to the daughter of Deffa.
According to a newspaper report on long-term projects for which he has borrowed money, the public finances were extremely short-term - which is now no longer possible due to mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the Bank's stock exchange was reduced by 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity ratio had slightly increased from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
Current earnings and net income from financial transactions fell to zero over the previous year's period, the income from claims and certain securities tenders and the resolution of deposits in the credit business decreased by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
However, due to the higher return on post-harvest costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the repayment of interest after the tax arrangement and from the business provision for group companies, the yield minus was still moderate by about 16 per cent.
The former state financier had first speculated after his privatisation in 1990 with commercial real estate loans, which were then distributed in the Aareal Bank.
Due to the lack of merit in classical state funding, the Deepfa had then increased in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community projects by private investors and the State (Private Public Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
At the value of the daughter, the Hippo Real Estate must now make a write-down which will have a "essential material effect" on the profit and loss of the group, it is quite uncertain.
The fact is, the dividends have been cut off.
Already in 2007, it was reduced by two thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a major public and infrastructure funder since the depfa acquisition.
It is stronger than other institutions depending on refinancing on the interbank market as it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the U.S. Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the lending of the banks is largely guaranteed again, as the banks heard their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs a part - about 50 billion euros - of the Depfa credit portfolio for short-term refinancing.
Following the notification of the Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing needs are covered by the loan at a time of notice and the company is protected "from the influence of the current largely inefficient international money markets".
From other sources, it is clear that thanks to the funds, refinancing has been secured by the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to take up the money markets at a time that can be seen.
The Bundesbank and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Centre (BaFin) assume that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secure.
This is hoped for shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But in view of the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even inevitable that funding should not be fully applied.
But also the opposite is not to be worn out.
After the company was still in insolvency on the late Sunday evening after the bank had left, at least the provisional rescue would not be able to calm the landlords.
The share rate breaks by 75 per cent to EUR 3.30.
On the other hand, it is quite good to keep in mind the interest rates.
If the priority debts are barely shown, the courses of postage bonds are more clearly stated.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, of course, the maturitys that went beyond 2009 are affected.
It seems that hypo-real-state bonds had previously been a speculative investment alternative, so their value has to be seen, after the significant increase in the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only taken over from the Deepfa, when the crisis was considered to be dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as notable banks, governments and less affected business banks are still ready to support the system, a timely payment of the pension can be made.
Or it will take on what is not yet expected of anyone - that the financial crisis will be overrun in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports which overlap with the partial legislation, the likelihood of safety-limitation has now become only a legitimate hope.
In particular, long-term creditors should prepare some sleepless nights with the decision to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can, however, use a profit margin for future payment tax payments to form a profit in course years later.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce himself to Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls start to sing: The German is total "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells from Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
I've had cotton before school.
I live on the coast of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and spend 40 minutes on the train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way by myself, and luckily I didn't.
The beginning of the teaching does not appear to be as strict as we do at home in Lower Saxony.
From eight o'clock, the students march in until about twenty-nine a short round of discussions with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before teaching started, I was about to introduce myself.
I'm not the type who likes to talk to people yet before a class of 40 students.
Because I hadn't had a school uniform yet, I wore an old dress from my mother's guest, such as blouses, blue knee-brows and black leather shoes.
So in this lift I put myself in front of the pull and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - I'm Sylvana, come from Germany and have a week's birthday.
At the time, I was very happy that I had started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all rubbed, chewed and chewed and I have heard the word "Kawaii" for a while.
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the survival of Japanese girls and means 'sweet, sweet'.
Then I'm in my seat fast.
The girl next to me was pretty broad, and she found it an honor to have the exchange student next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was regularly disturbed.
Everyone talked to each other and kooked and asked me holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the break, all her bentos were taken out.
My guest mother had also made me such a lunch box - that's a little different from the fates of German breakers.
I had rice with herbs, small herbs, salad from barley and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofumantel.
Most of the time, I don't have any bluffs, which I eat right here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
I'm sure everything's really nice.
Well, up to the salty flowers, maybe, brrr!
Bentos are not just lunch in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a self-prepared bento, which then she is especially artistic - in the hope of getting to know the boys closer to the rest of the day.
That's what I read in my Manga comics.
I'm kind of nervous about watching this, too.
'Why does Japan count?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I've always said:
"Because it fascinates me now."
After all, I've been reading Mangas for years.
And to better understand the comics and culture in it, I also started learning a little Japanese sometime.
So it was clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, seats and breaks.
And you value it here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have not felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
Does a rat or a sheep fly at risk mean that it also feels afraid?
The neuroscience scientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can you test whether they feel the same way if they behave the way we do?
For several years, contributions from famous scientists have been published in the Internet magazine Edge.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other consciousness conditions, without that I or anyone else could prove this so far where we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we should at least hope that all human brains will have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we apply other species and cut out questions of the feeling or general awareness, we enter uninhabited sites because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it kills itself, flees or attacks.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists draw on a comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe that, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
For one thing, the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its participation in the short-term memory and the performance/control functions).
This broad region is much higher in humans than in the other primates and seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason for the assumption that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic nature should lie in the linguistic nature of man: Since such a large part of his experience is connected with language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would affect it, so that animal consciousness, as it may also be acquired, would probably differ much from most of our consciousness-states.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine how consciousness may appear in other animals.
If it can be analyzed, as an internal and subjective thing, neither measured nor, because of the special hardware, based on our own experience, it presents us with great problems.
Most of my performances relate to the content of the most conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically easier to access.
The consciousness processes of animals could be investigated regardless of their content, and that is precisely what happens in studies on the short-term memory of Primates, especially in the example of visualisation.
But in this approach, followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, one relies on the neural correlates of consciousness rather than on the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the coming of visualization.
What happens now to the feelings?
I bring it back to her that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its own activities consciously.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or their consequences, like physical reactions) is shown to be working memory.
In this way, feelings are closely linked to the regions of the Cortex, the Primates and in particular the people.
Related to the linguistic nature are fine degrees of feeling, because with the help of words and grammar, we can differentiate and categorize states in order to add them to ourselves as well.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings of more primitive activities in the regions of the cortex and the brain stem emerge similar to Jaak Panksseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed very much during human evolution, it can be fully involved in transversal feelings.
In theory, I can't resist it, but it's unmistakable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to rats and people like fear is likely in both cases: But how can one check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A sheep flees in danger if it also feels afraid?
In my eyes, the mere conductivity can still not prove the same as experience.
While the neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar brain stems, sheep do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove it to people: how did you want to prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even sheep (we know?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, progress on the neural level is being made here, provided that the same is done in rats and humans.
As I don't explore language and consciousness in rats, nor do I feel, I don't know if they exist.
You can keep it brief, but I'd rather go ahead than walk against a wall all the time.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Time of grace for Poland and Ukraine
The Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the Uefa decision in Bordeaux as evidence of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organize the EM together with Poland," Vasjunik said.
"But that's not amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries."
In the schedule for the construction or conversion of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts are behind.
Perhaps even the number of EM stages is reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We need to work at maximum speed now," said Ukrainian Federation President Grigory Surkis.
"The UEFA will keep us in the eye constantly."
A further radical step was taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended following numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "the serious danger that the PZPN is unable to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish News Agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for EM 2012 will not be affected."
In the past season, several initialists had been convicted of manipulation only because of the increase in forced labour, and even the start of the league had to be postponed in a short time.
Touched Dennis Quaid kicks back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in the interview about Privates - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood-Star Meg Ryan outta her scared Dennis Quaid as a husband.
He shames - and beats back.
Late Rosen war at the former spouse Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an unpleasant dispute with each other - in all public.
In an interview with the U.S. Journal of InStyle last week, Meg Ryan said for the first time: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of fraud has only been experienced after divorce.
The reason for the stroke was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of a marriage break is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband fell out clearly: "Unbelievably," said 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News", that "Meg once again sells and folds the story of our relationship".
It is also "depressive," that the 16-year-old son of Jack is again "publicly reminded of the pain and the revolutions that mean a separation for each child."
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid has been remarried and recently father of twins.
And then he closes his admissions with the page title: "My life goes on anyway.
I am happy that I have a wonderful family that is doing well."
Discount prices for tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even cheaper, according to a current study, up to 50 percent.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become more favourable - this is the result of a study by the American Express travel and financial service provider.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, found a significant break in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, overnight stays have already been reached in many places.
From January to March, prices in European cities surveyed in 41 of 48 were still on average 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend in Paris and Rome was most evident, where travellers had to pay between 30 and 37 percent less than a year earlier.
For this reason American Express sees the weak dollar course, which led to a "absorbing tourist journey of American tourists".
Financial spots such as Frankfurt or London were also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices are increasing by 26.3 percent even keeping the record in Europe.
In the first quarter of the year, the trend was even higher:
Due to the kerosene consumption, passengers in the economy class had to pay more than 7.1 percent than 2007, fuel intensive long-distance flights were even 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for tickets from the economic class decreased by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first class the price changes were significantly lower.
In Germany, prices were even stronger than in other European countries:
From January to March prices increased by 11.9 percent, they decreased by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
According to the study, on German domestic flights, prices were even half.
On the one hand, the company explains the reason for the price collapse is the resulting economic growth.
The demand in many segments of the flight market is broken.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe provides an increased competitive pressure.
Signs of the tense situation were the elimination of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had registered the first half of 2008 competition - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV hit Gladbach 1:0
With a door and simple methods, the Hamburger SV table guide.
Luhukay is still unable to find a functioning Elf at Borussia.
From Kristoff Klein enlarges broken landing for national players Marko Marin.
The gladbacher came into the game soon and fired with a liver on the latte.
His message was specifically formulated, she went convincingly over his lips.
He knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," Hermann Rieger said in the cabin passage of the Hamburg Arena.
Many were not left in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most of them sat back in their seats.
Rieger was an HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades, and he enjoyed a higher reputation than a man who was a man of horror.
And so his prayer was also heard in a responsible position.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nibbed and dummed accordingly.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's chief coach Martin Jol.
Its command is similar: Here with two gates!
The implementation remained unimplemented.
"There wasn't everything to look at today," Marcel Jansen later added.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have "successful desire".
The 1:0 (1:0) have to thank the Hamburgers for the Mladen Petric's headball match (11); and the fact that very weak gladbacher could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol together.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the viewers celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the arena and the flashboards on the video wall, which proved their association to be a class premiere.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to sort this out," said Marcel Jansen.
He recognizes that the tableware is more for the incompatibility of the league than for the domination of its HSV.
The team with its late mandatory access - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the Torchutz Petric and the Jansen who was recruited by the FC Bayern - is slow, but still unable to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," Jol asked.
After the vote
On the Wall Street, the fear is gone.

However, the amount is not to be paid at any rate, but to be calculated on a step-by-step basis.
On the contrary, the State should receive a stock option card from financial corporations that could be redeemed in the event of appropriate price developments in order to reduce the burden on the State Treasury.

Dark matter affects flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has taken care of researchers for advicelessness: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by-manover.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity could not be quite correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" flew through space.
Because of soon-frozen fuel pipelines, you are now threatened with cold death.
For years among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has created confusion - the swing-by-anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flightover of space probes, where they receive additional vibrations in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Research Sonde Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Sun Sonde Ulysses.
What the researchers have been surprised at, however, for years: the air bodies do not behave 100 percent as expected by the ancient gravity law.
Much more is involved in irregularity in the speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general relativity theory Albert Einstein, which describes the attractiveness of matter through a distortion of space, could not be quite correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler from Princeton Institute for Advanced Study still believes that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the swing-by-anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have invented in the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
From the existence of the dark matter, space researchers have only known for about ten years.
Obviously, it is an attractive force whose effect on other celestial bodies can be seen.
It itself is completely invisible, that is, it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
After the calculations of the scientists, however, the dark matter makes good one-fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists who were dragged into Egypt will be released again, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The exporters from Sudan had asked for several million euros in cash.
In the case of a gunfight before the release, six hostages were to be killed.
Five Germans were deported in southern Egypt.
Remuneration negotiations are already under way.
The Germans returned to the Visier of Kidnappern.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists who have landed in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabia and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports by the Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We're just checking her health status," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, and their eight Egyptian companions, were well and safe, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants in a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
Clearly, the reasons for a shooting were still unclear before the hostages were released: hence, the kidnappers were prepared, according to an Egyptian security officer, to finish the kidnapping before the Sudanese army suddenly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," the officer said.
It was "just gone to receive the hostages", when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers had shot six of the kidnappers in the border between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday, and two of them were arrested.
The hostages had demanded a six-million-euro ransom from Germany; the money should be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" called on a German mediator to delay the release of the hostages because the kidnappers feared their safety.
According to the report, the exporters want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be detained for as long as the kidnappers have a safe flight route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
The abuse of the stepfather "leaded to suicide"
The prolonged abuse by her stepfather led to the death of a woman, a court was reported.
Michael Treise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after he had suffered eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Court of Justice in Truro found that he regularly held his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Treise wrote in a statement: "I feel responsible for her death."
The Court found that Mrs Randle moved to her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise had tied her eyes together before he was committing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a guesthouse.
Treise and his wife separated in the 1980s and moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the Court found that Mrs Randle, who worked for a large part of her time in respect of the National Trust, was persecuted for abuse which had been added to her twice a week.
State attorney Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Mrs. Randle, who had been an efficient surfer and biker, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had given up her life"
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she died by squeezing herself through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of appreciation, saying, "I cared to tie her and tie her eyes."
"I didn't need them sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "They are an extremely scary fetishist and for her sacrifice it must have been awesome, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the victim's suicide.
Worse yet, the fact is that it is very unlikely that the case would not have been brought before the court if she had not done so."
He added: "I am aware of the effects that Stephanie’s father and mother had on her daughter over the years, according to the description of her father and mother.
Otherwise she would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officer responsible for lost data is charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet officer who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June will be charged under the Public Security Act.
The man was seconded by the Ministry of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest prosecution within the law and there is no reference to criminal intent.
BBC Defence Correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "They would have thought that this would have been the case within the Ministry of Defense and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be mentioned shall be charged, in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Act, with the clause relating to the safe storage of information.
The Royal Public Prosecutor recommended that the officer be accused by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Secret Service Committee.
The documents he submitted included classified reviews about Al-Quaida and the capacities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed about the decision on Monday morning and was brought from his house to a secret place.
Apartment construction companies see B&B costs in the eye
Following the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank, British housing companies could cost more than 80 million pounds in the house.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingleys 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies receiving the money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The Director General of the Housing Association (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "inconvenient", that the companies and their members had to pay.
The 14 billion loans will finally be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans are settled.
But the interest accrued in the interim will be charged annually to the 700 financial corporations that accept the deposits.
The financial services compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies are included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions that have acted prudently ... are now called to take over some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company had to pay in relation to the investments it would keep, and that the companies together had to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest on the loan will rise to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that the companies have to acquire 81 million pounds for the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Housing Association, told the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have acted prudently during the property acquisition will now be called up to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has been destroyed since the records were recorded in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter over the coming weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010 interest rates will fall for a full year and this could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are both non-citizen organisations, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or by lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five Pence per litre
The people on Jersey are confronted with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre of Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after an investigation of a consulting company has been carried out.
The retailers themselves should decide whether they want to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Prior to the increase in prices in February, the wholesale price of Jersey Milk was changed last year in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh against bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail application from former Prime Minister Sheich Hasina, which means that she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Her defenders said that the Court of Justice refused to have pressured 50 million Taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several floating charges of corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released this month against bail.
Sheikh Hasina was to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Avami Alliance, demanded that the military-supported transitional government grant her unlimited freedom first.
The correspondents say that, although their detention was granted in order to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear in the context of their release whether they will be able to remain free when they return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers state that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court's decision.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's petition for bail because it says that she does not have to receive bail because she is already on prison leave abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a complaint against the upper court."
Their lawyers ask that they need bail to return from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
It was expected that Sheikh Hasina would return home after October 17th, said an Avami-Bondis-Chairman on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the army-supported transitional government had taken over power, but in June she was released from prison to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia lie to themselves.
Fears of the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-polo initiative in Afghanistan, almost 200,000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence brought about by the Taliban, as the United Nations.
Last week, the United Nations implemented an immunization programme in six provinces.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to one UN speaker, this was the case despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or prevent the thousands of personnel carrying out the vaccinations.
BskyB loses complaint in the case of ITV
BskyB has lost its complaint against the Competition Commission's decision to reduce its share of the competing ITV broadcaster.
The Competition Court ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that the BskyBs share distorts competition and enables it to have an unfairer influence on the ITV broadcaster.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by re-named NTL in Virgin Media, successfully preventing the purchase of ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the ITV share by BskyB would raise doubts about the independence of the ITV, which the Competition Commission had moved to start an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Communications Office Ofcom have spoken against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and excessive measure, in particular because BskyB had announced to give up its voting rights.
New investigation in the U.S. State Prosecutor's Office
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special prosecutor to deal with the termination of the nine state prosecutors in the United States in 2006.
The case was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administrative staff were criticised.
The report criticised the officials of the Weissen House, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by the fears that lawyers were suspended for political reasons.
The Special Agent Nora Dannehy will now discuss whether the investigators who were interviewed during the investigation have angels to prevent justice.
Serious assumptions including criminal proceedings have not been fully investigated or clarified, Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a specialist with the authority to force witnesses to speak was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Ministry of Justice in December 2006 dismissed nine US lawyers from their offices.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors would be dismissed on the basis of weak work.
However, it was later found that the released state lawyers were not worse judged than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to view the announcements as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking members of the Republican Congress, while others had refused to investigate the allegations of the electoral fraud of the Democrats.
U.S. U.S. state prosecutors are therefore ordered to investigate and prosecute judicial cases for the government.
They may be released at any time, but may not be suspended for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Advocate General Alberto Gonzales, has been arrested for his dismissals and has ultimately reduced his office.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also announced.
The Commissioner-General's report has particularly criticised the role of Gonzales by having the "main responsibility" for the dismissals, having given up his leadership role and having shown himself to be "extremely disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including former President Bush Karl Rove's chief advisor, have been criticised for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat praise's epic song to be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored during the "Q Award" award for his epic Hymne "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, the next week in London, will accept his special gold price during the award, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's hit album from 1977.
"Coldplay" marks the nominations for the award this year after it has come into four categories in the narrower selection.
The editor of the journal "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said that there were some songs that go beyond such matters as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" was certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman demanded a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in 1979 in Britain as a single in the sale and reached place 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times around the world.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heart beat after he broke up on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to an acute convulsion.
Later it was known that he had a bite on his voice belt.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possible soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, alone, side streets and other surrounding roads, some of which are famous and others are only comfortable.
Nevertheless, it is even difficult for experienced taxi drivers and long-standing locals to say where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This small street is located in the East Village and runs from First Street to North between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching the Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty gas than a actively used transit road.
There are no road signs either.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road plan.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
It wants to create an extra place to create a clean journey to the shops and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
The other tenants are part of the long-standing neighborhood, which says they are fascinated by the short gas, simply because it is one of the rest of the past of the house block.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in obtaining them.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the Municipality this month, representatives of the City Administration and Avalon Bay have proposed the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the Committee prefers that the road remain in the hands of the city and has asked for a new plan to be submitted in the coming month, says Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the municipality 3.
"Only very little space has remained in the city's possession and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers of how to repair the road and operate what Avalon could do, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small street would set up new patches and seats, which would include a café that the company would like to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first made public during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a speaker from Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road, but they did not want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this lost gas and make it a public meeting point," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Building Protection Department, thought it was actually the city's desire to sell the road and stressed that the department's task was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to his colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of his historical impressions.
Some believe that the road got its name in 1802, when a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and a narrow country was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk memorial, which was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is certainly most known as the bullet for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of Ramones, who had taken the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scraps, lumps and parts of fibers, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the genitalization of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, with the argument that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rareness – a practically unchanged splitter of the city, which should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog "Jeremiah's disappearing New York" (titled "The Book of Complaints: A bitter nostalgic view of the dying city"), published a part of the city story story about Extra Place, which was published in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, at that time wrote: "Extra Place is a small narrow pocket gas that remains dark even over the day and is marked by the metal doors of the warehouse halls, closed windows and on raindrops past flying week-old newspapers."
With few exceptions, the road had just appeared on an evening.
A ratt walked through the back of the road, not far from the door that led to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing business.
Graffiti were visible on the walls and an empty bottle of beer was not far from a fresh bundle of sorted newspapers.
Some passengers said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be polished something.
Fields added that, in his opinion, some people underestimated the road trip in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, damp and noble.
Discussions on bilingual education: education in English-speaking environment
In this issue of the "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for dual-language education.
Lance T. Izumi, director of scientific staff in California Studies and director of the field of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as well as you think: Why the middle class needs a school choice".
Addressing Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barack Obama's suggestions on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's election campaign mentions "the probability of successful completion of the school by African-American and Hispanic students is lower than by white students" - which is correct.
In order to close this distance of performance, Obama’s education plan recommends, among other things, a two-lingual transition in training for those who first learn English.
Nevertheless, the question for Obama is whether his use of two-language training, which puts the emphasis on teaching in languages other than English, is contrary to his interest in reducing distance in schoolwork.
For example, "Sixth Street Prep", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
Most of the students are Hispanic and come from families with low income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
However, in 2008 a surprising 100 percent of fourth-class students had passed the state examination in Mathe on a good level.
Also surprising were 93 percent of the children from the fourth year of school in the English exam as well.
This amazing success was achieved by other methods than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School focuses on verification and exercise, on constant control of knowledge and a attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
The school also practices the approach followed by training in an English-speaking environment. That is exactly the point that Obama should observe, according to the teacher Linda Mikels.
This approach places value on the almost exclusive use of English in teaching.
Mrs. Mikels, who rejected the idea of two-language education, told me that the school would have a remarkable success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico. 12 months later one would enter the classroom and no longer be able to recognize him.
"It works," she noted, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English-learning students?
The services of the school would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational policy positions within its own party (the national educational associations have been supporting the idea of dual-language education) and its own consistent support of dual-language education make predictions about Obama's response uncertain.
While agreeing to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about the "English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "They should make sure your child can Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance gap, he should take careful account of the training models that work instead of insulting and trivializing them.
The oil price decreases due to renewed fears about the economy
The oil price is high on Monday because of the fears that even the US rescue plan for the financial markets could not be sufficient to relive the economy.
The raw oil terminals at the New York trade fair fell by 7 per cent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday the price has fallen by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the goods markets have been shaken by both the financial turbulence on the Wall Street and by strong storms in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices in July reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel, they fell to nearly $90 per barrel this month to increase again as a result of the huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors were once again concerned, although congress representatives had announced that they would have agreed on a rescue plan on the weekend, which should be the biggest in history.
This message was overestimated by new concerns that the financial crisis has not yet been completed.
In the first chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government statement on Monday, the Citigroup is going to buy the banks of the Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial groups Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, it appears that despite the intense negotiations that took place in the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it was not possible to live the mood on the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is expected that demand for goods, including oil, will continue to decline.
Analysts from the Deutsche Bank have written in a notice to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe that they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the goods markets, we are mostly concerned about whether the US virus is spreading worldwide, especially in China."
The Bank's analysts adjusted their expectations for oil consumption due to weak economic growth for the following year and reduced their oil and gas prices by 20% for 2009.
Team record by series in the second quarter
Integrating Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything, after he had lived more often than anyone else in the Jets Trikkot in the last eight and a half years.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter in which the jets turned a resultless game into a triumphal draw.
"That's something I've never seen before," Ellis said.
After a silly game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect rise to an afternoon on which their developing cooperation made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this area for two more touchdowns, which one time as an external defender and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I wasn't particularly stressed," says Coles about the passes that went to Coles.
"He's a superplayer.
Our vote has been voted, no matter what people think."
While playing Favre and Cole's captures, the defense took Quarterback Kurt Warner apart.
Externally defending Darrelle Revis started a unfortunate throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and started him.
Linebacker David Bowens then made sure he lost Warner.
The last ball loss, forced by Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinal had won the ball with another 10 seconds in the game when the jets took the ball back and Jay Feelly turned a 20-yard shot to 34 to 0 leadership.
These were the most points the jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the nonsense, Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets, replied "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
On the two answers, because the jets left 21 points in the third quarter without one, Mangini said: "I believe I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points have been achieved in a short time."
Exhausted Gebrslassia beats its world record
Hail Gebrslassia from Ethiopia has shown again why some hold him for the best long-distance runners of all time, after he broke his own record on Sunday in Berlin Marathon and became the first man to make the 42.2 kilometers track in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course at 2:03:59, Gebrslassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrslassie, 35, has thus set up his 26th world record in his varied career, where he has reached at least one world championship title or set a world record on every track from a kilometer to a marathon.
Last month, Gebrslassia left the Olympic Marathon in Beijing out of fear, which may have been exacerbated in the past, that air pollution could worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - in the sun and 9 degrees at the beginning and 13 degrees at the target - have won gebrsslassie with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since railway runners such as Gebrslassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have changed on long distances, the record time for Marathon in the last 10 years has fallen for more than 2 minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselasia reported to the press, he would have had seizures in his Wade two weeks ago and therefore could not train for a week.
Apparently he was refreshed after a break and did not return to rest.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything is perfect.
I took the training back a week ago and had some more concerns today, but at the end everything was great."
He has been criticised for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - that he is excessively orchestrated in running, many of the world's best Marathonstars generally feel that he relys too much on race leaders as if it were a race, and world record about the competition.
However, this criticism does little harm to the size of germination cells as long-term runners.
With four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselasia reached the center of the route at 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai, and Charles Kamathi have continued to challenge Gebrslaslassia after the tempomas left.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselasia made his last entry to separate from Kwambai, who came as a second at 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became third at 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Deutsche, has completed a remarkable year by showing at 2:19:19 the fastest result of all times.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Last spring the 36-year-old Mikitenko had won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She has missed the games in Beijing due to problems described as rear injury. However, she has rested to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon for five minutes.
She has planned her course by leaving a quarter of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to leave, but after 30 kilometers.
Ascale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia became second at 2:21:31, while Helena Cyprus arrived from Kenya as a third at 2:25:01.
The pride and the traps in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hiding between the expansions of leisure parks around Orlando, a few miles away from the glittering, loud and gigantic drives, is a quiet city in which the pride and complications of African-American culture appear.
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the home city Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquet squares, 300 brown hides, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guaven, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it's a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to remember the most famous author of Harlem Renaissance.
And yet it is and remains the city that describes it – and which made it a tourist destination by taking it into the Florida Travel Guide, which was produced at the time of the depression of the federal writer project – in many respects a place of very special variety.
Eatonville is so independent, dazzling and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man, who "so little knows about us that he doesn't know what's going on with him."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, called for an open debate on racial relations, many are still sorry to be observed by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a city resident and community member of the oldest church of the city.
There must be a vote."
Eatonville has long been defined as the paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is a historical example of the black movement as well as a community of nearly 2,400 inhabitants, in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the country average.
On the one hand, it is a high castle of literature and on the other hand an example of - sometimes condemned, sometimes honored - black culture of the rural south that has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that people here are both proud and on the hill.
And so rightly the concerns about Eatonville's image began with Zora, as all Hurstons call it.
She introduced the world to her hometown in books that came from hearts and were written in mouth, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida Travel Guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road leading through the often forgotten centre of Florida to the shadows of black history and human drama.
Frech and Oskar both in real life and in literature, Hurston reader led to the loading of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private matters.
"Besides the road to the left," she wrote, "there is the brown - white-cut modern school, with its planted gardens and playgrounds, which always takes care of Howard Miller, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new man of Witwe Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sold drinks of any kind and what-so-ever fits in hourly rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston thus linked Eatonville with self-esteem, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described the things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls baffled Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about their beauty that were full of sexual toys.
She added, "Many people don't like this."
You still remember Hurtson here as a living eccentric who returned regularly after her family had moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston came to the city, she did this mostly without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants, in a city that today pictures something on her dignified style.
According to Mr Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, but many of them did not.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added while he was staring in his chair, on a terrace behind the Sabelia Lake, in which the Hurston of all probability was baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and buried her books.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived, in an anonymous tomb.
In Eatonville there was no great commemoration, no public readings in great style.
"I don't think that they understood their contribution in the world or their legacy in Geringsten," says Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the '80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to lay a five-track highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-track main road of the municipality.
Orlandos Voororte had already pushed the 4th motorway through the western edge of the city.
The proposal was presented when Eatonville still recovered from a difficult phase in his history.
Compulsory integration, among other things, had put an end to the relative idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred into the Community.
"In this time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff on the people sitting aside," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston demanded that the Supreme Court require integration by calling for Brown to act against the Board as "respective of my race" in the case of Brown.
People today say that although the abolition of racial separation was positive in some respects, it weakened the group's cohesion in Eatonville and the self-consciousness of its young people.
"Black children were used to getting hugged - I remember - they hugged their teachers in the morning and hugged their teachers in the evening," says N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville Community.
This could be maintained for so long, added it until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"I didn't hug his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I think there is a cultural divide," said Mrs. Nathiri.
However, citizens' rights have contributed to the creation of space for other Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who have gone beyond prejudices, as they have done, with positive self-consciousness and statements such as: "How can anyone deny the joy of my society?
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker made his way to Hurston's nameless grave and began fighting for the restoration of her fame.
Five years later, a well-known Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the bookstores, and again made it part of the American Literature Canon.
The road project came just at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the public light.
And this time Hurston saw her old neighbors as a savior.
The municipality began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the motorway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-track road inhabited the city, speeded up the whole with peak speed, aroused real citizens' shocks," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd said something simpler: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the road project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
There were more and more trips, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been in the church since 1993 and locals have begun to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was registered in 1998 in the national historical register.
A new single library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly bottled and beautiful Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a specialty in Florida: only 6 miles from the city centre of Orlandos can sometimes feel like a back gas in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is today 90% black.)
Externals looking for the history of Eatonville and its importance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, a prior approval is necessary and certain things - like the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a wiseman and represented by black men at field work - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that their protected community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time as the Hurston Festival was bigger, an increased degree of homestead was also born.
Above all, young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither bad nor better and just as proud, creative and smooth, alber and blended like any other race and people in America.
It is the sincere love of this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's Neffen, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who went back to Eatonville College to work in the city administration or in the police station, who could use some help, according to him.
And even the disciples, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who just go through here will think, "Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon recently on a Sunday after church.
"But if you actually stop and look at his story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, you talk to me about financial latrine.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspapers and violent TV screens in Times Square, they would not notice that they are in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that their heads, in the shoe box-like offices with the glass fibers, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the Monopol in New York have the worst horror working day ever since 1929.
The suppliers still slide the metal tea scales along the citizens' stairs and carry tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still wander between apartments, as human packers load around the 50 curved T-shirts that hang on a jock-like pole lying on their shoulders.
Office employees are still waiting for food on their breakfast bag and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 16 and 19 hours.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until I decided on Thursday afternoon to open a new savings account because of all the world's crisis.
Although I had decided to place my duty on the quiet afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase tribal branch, about 20 people were already standing.
Not to raise or deposit money on the money changers, but to the customer service switch where family customers order cheques, tourists ask for the way to Macy's shop and where new customers open accounts.
Most of the time, I later learned from Starr, my "personal bank employee with license", stood for the same reason as I did.
Unlike me, however, they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, in places from which they were suspended, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called tribes (a little similar to a building park), social banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state and say they treat their customers like families.
Last year, 15 of these banks went silent and silent.
In the last few days Washington Mutual, a bank with facilities of $327 billion, in competition management and last Friday New Yorker went home for the weekend, was Wachovia, another bank with a saving facility worth $440 billion, looking for a life-saving buyer.
In the fear of another raid, the office and cargo officers brought their bar before me to a bank that is considered safe port, a bank that is responsible for most rescue purchases on the Wall Street.
Quite normal New Yorkers have adapted to the current financial latrine in the last few weeks.
A woman who telephoned in my Chinese supermarket took so much of the confidence of Lehman Brothers, the bank that went to the court and its deposed CEO Dick Full, as if she would be reading about a fake colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my block of residence, has come from our usual entertainment themes about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds" she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not taking any risks anymore."
Muslim Graves Distorted during the Judiciary in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing director of the Austrian Right Party of Freedom of Austria, and Philip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian Right Pertei Vlaams Belang, participates in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008 to represent the organization "Cities Against Islamism".
They wear signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is painted, crossed with a red line.
The police accuse law extremists of the kidnapping at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, and on the same weekend, the extremely right party will record significant gains in the country's parliamentary election.
In the night of Friday to tomorrow, more than 90 miners were seriously injured at the cemetery in Traun near Linz in an organised action, according to the police.
The perpetrators flung Jewish symbols like the David Stern on some of the graves, but criminals hold this as an attempt to obscure the motive of the extremists driven by hatred on Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the event is in any way associated with the elections.
One speaker of the local Islamic community said she was "too deeply scared" about the message of the burial that took place when the religious month of Muslim Ramadan turned to the end.
At the same time, in Austria, there is a round of conscience research following the country's right-wing parliamentary elections.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, which received almost 30% of the votes from both far right-wing parties, joined in their campaign for a strict anti-immigrant law, and some of their speech was criticised by opponents as being foreign.
Heinz-Christian Strache, President of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, took part in a ban on headaches and burkas and even exposed his refusal to food that is generally linked to Islam.
In his last announcement in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of mosaics and minerals with the argument that these political symbols of continuous Islamism are Austria and Europe.
Investigations and analyses carried out immediately after the election and stating that the extreme rights of the political strongest bloc are in the country indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel block for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam-Rockstar, who was convicted of child sexual abuse, was sentenced to travel to France and Spain.
Glitter set up a six-month suspension after informing the authorities that informed him about it, he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
The police in Kent were granted a ban on foreign travel on the last Thursday after presenting evidence to the judges of Glitter's pre-trial proceedings for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the Ashford Court of Justice in Kent, but was represented by the lawyer's office Cork Binning.
EIN spokesperson of the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday, 25 September, the police officer Kent at Ashford's court asked for permission to prevent travel abroad from Mr. Paul Glad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not present in person."
According to the register for sexual offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a five-year prison sentence.
The police in Kent said they wouldn't discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible place of residence in the country.
A spokesperson for Kent's Police Unit said: "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"In our view, it is easier to control someone who is in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the highest concern of the police in Kent to protect the citizens of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual offenders in the country in order to minimize any risk that might exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter fled to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to fly to London.
But he said he didn't feel comfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not leave him through the passport check and he flew to one and Her to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused his entry and fled back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Finally, on August 22, he arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there during his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge's office in West London, since Scotland Yard had successfully requested permission to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had previously been arrested in 1999 for 4 months in the United Kingdom because of the possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of Interior, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was calmed and satisfied that Glitter had been stopped to travel to France and Spain.
`I receive the master behind the stage to hold his character’, Günter brewer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no Russians, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the large flamenco dancers who refuse to concentrate and devote themselves to the interpretation to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
One-sided artist
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, in these moments that are foreign to the public, I know when I can find for the personality typical gesture, the depth of a stolen glance or expression of the hands that are concerned because they will not enter the stage.
In his project 'Flemenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents varied theatres on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this page he was still not known to the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of the flame-coding at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the programme of the month of photography of the Flamenco, reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is growing from day to day,' explains the artist and makes it clear that 'Flemenco-people' can be any person, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notices that there are no typical pictures of artists on stage.
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey joy on stage passion, sadness, and so move the audience.
In order to maintain the personality of these artists, you don't have to take pictures on stage.
Her personality and character are in her heart.
What I was interested in was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the biggest flamencomers with the camera.'
Farmer, inspired by the festival 'Cante de las Minas', made a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the video sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images created that remind you of classical photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, thereby granting the image the modernity and idea, as the farmer Flamenco understands: `music with traditional roots that change and surprise every day'.
These are not only the dance, the song or the instrument game on itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, which with his art seduces the audience.
The search for the essential, for something that will be visible in the form of the ear, of the being, is and was the firm goal of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the gallery of the El Fotómata.
Known personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the narrow selection of almost seventy artists who have been photographed.
The project became an anthology of the flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to take up this idea two years ago and to carry out the "portrait of the veterans of the sport" ('SportARTproject').
Although the concepts of the project `Flemenco-people' are different, I like the photographer very much to photograph the people, to know them and to move me in their condition of life, whether for a short time or for a longer time.
I think in the field of photography, the portrait is the most difficult type.
You meet people, people you don't even know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of the portraits of the flamenco of today with the title 'Flemenco-people' is shown in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located on the street with the name la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. The exhibition can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa says that the Rome he just writes is a great festival.
He does not yet know where the Roman action is taking place and what is going on there, but Mario Vargas Llosa is trying hard to advance the project he is currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Hay Festival Segovia Festival, the favorite Nobel Prize winner added that the project he is dealing with is “a great festival” and “all indicates that he did not have to write the novel”.
'If I were to do so, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel sometime', so he concluded his participation at the festival where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciuda y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, the prize winner of the Hay Festival and most of the audience gave their voice, is compared to the old edition of 'Our mutual friend' and is shown in the theater Juan Bravo.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found that he had a audience before him, who noticed that the Peruvian, who had a wonderful memory and great sense of humor, had not been given enough time to go through all of this: how his vocation for literature was created, which was created from ‘extraordinary adventure’, from ‘freud on reading’ and from ‘more to experience’ than before; how he wrote and ‘discipline’ to complement ‘the lack of inspiration’, his intensive work with documentation, numerous corrections and revisions that he does; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation, and what ‘discipline’ are the roots of his stories.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that there is no way of measuring where and how to know whether books change life, `but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an experiential experience,' stressed Vargas Llosa, who claims that it has caused 'effects' and 'humans even more apart', so I asked the writers 'do not abandon the ease' and 'responsibility' for his calling 'over'.
At the party in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: Styrian champions fell out in part.
After the announced bullfighters found that the floor of the square was in bad shape, the bullfight with which the festival should be concluded in Pozoblanco was to be closed in the morning.
So the organizer, with the agreement of Fermin Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to move the bullfight.
Thus, the festival of unsustainable weather was exposed, so two of the three festivals could not be held.
On Saturday it rained that the second scheduled bullfight could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group was composed of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who entered the bullfighting camp from one to the next.
That's how there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and triumphed, after whom he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he managed more by galloping than by his art of fighting.
And even worse was El Juli, who went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he had fought so badly, most of the audience reacted to his second fight with buh-rufen.
In Álava, two people wanted to leave the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of Haschisch.
Tomorrow: five minutes before ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the city area of Armiñon ( Álava).
Two policemen called on the car drivers to stop, and then they took the flight.
It seemed as if with the loading of more than two thousand kilo hashish, they did not have to stop.
The police persecuted her and found one of the drivers, the man of 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as reported by the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State.
The person arrested was accused of drug trafficking and counterfeiting of official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic police officers of the region of Álava had already completed the traffic control at N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
She decided to stop a car to run the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to get out of control.
The police began the persecution until the car stopped after a few kilometres on the edge of the road. At the moment, the drivers went out of the car to flee across a road to a forest area.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza finally picked up one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 Kilo Haschisch, which was seized by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later directed to the precise laboratory analysis and to the balance of the bundle to other police stations.
In addition, the officials found that the badge was `double', so it did not match the markings given in the Kfz papers, which is why there was also a arrest due to the counterfeiting of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigations to carry out the arrest of the second suspect, who, as mentioned above, was able to flee, but also to identify the origin of the seized drugs.
The 28-year-old A.A. J. was taken to a police station for arrest.
Artist Heather Lockler was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
The actress Heather Lockler, known for the role of Amanda from the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
One Witness observed how she tried to get out of her car accident in Montecito in quite rare ways, spokesmen of the California traffic police reported to the magazine 'People'.
The Witness told me in detail that Locklear expressed his gaspedal at 4:30 p.m. and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forth from the parking lot, and when she drove back, she stuck several times on her sunglasse."
A little later, the witness saw that the actress probably did not know at first that Locklear was on a nearby road and was driving out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had `anxed about Locklers'.
When the police officers arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, which stood all over the street and blocked traffic.
'They seemed to be pointless', so they brought the police into a special drug and alcohol center to make a test.
According to a police speaker, the actress showed a cooperative, excessive alcoholism was excluded from the first moment. `The first observations of the officials as a result, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug’, the speaker said.
Locklear was arrested under suspicion of driving an indefinite substance which could not be determined and brought to a local investigator by 19 o'clock.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released after treatment from the clinic in Arizona, where she was treated with anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Association of the United Left will be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the Chief Coordinator of the VL and the United Left, today has ensured that the Regional Association for Education will be the one who will meet the decision in the case of the former Council for Youth and Sport of the Council in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who was retired last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
'In such cases I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who must take responsibility for it', Llamazars pointed out what approach the party must have against the one that has so far been sitting as a council in the municipality of Seville.
Nevertheless, the president of the VL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the violations of the rules that Silva could have started: 'The VL always insisted that such cases be given maximum transparency'.
In this regard, he stressed that education has a strict ethical code for all public offices.
'Sangre de Mayo': Helmbuch von Garci
Inspired by 'Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci presents in `Sangre de mayo' the revised version of the famous rise of the Spaniards against the French. This is a wonderful film in filmography, with about 15 million euros of investment for the rotational work.
In this way, the cinema has tried to present a lot of personalities and social analysis, which he has always admired in the works of the famous Roman writer, Carci today explained in the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of the performers.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, this Friday is presented in cinemas and later shown on the broadcast telemadrid as a four-hour ministry.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of the literature of Galdós, assures that thanks to this work, he went on to carry out his ‘Kindheitstraum’. This was due to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the autonomous community Madrid to turn a memorial film for the second century festival in Madrid on 2 November. Especially because the story is based on the basis of ‘Episodios Nationales’, he accepted the assignment.
The total contribution of 15 million made by the Madrid Autonomous Community for Rotary Works provides Garci, as he added, with the help of decorations and appropriate clothing, the image of the 'confused Spain, which sought the false leader for the fight because the people had been defeated by the struggle for independence and under the rule of the VII Ferdinand.'
However, the cinematographer regrets that with funding such as 'Alatriste' or 'Los phantasmas de Goya' (two times as high as 'Sangre de mayo'), some scenes from the spinbook with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci worked almost all his career, could not be turned.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in 'Volver a empezar', was involved in his usual work: he focused on the stage to the actors with whom to try first to turn and for those who had not made a casting, he appeared 'degrading' and respect, `part of the work of the film director is to provide help in the theater and cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which you work'.
Many of the performers he is fighting in 'Sangre de Mayo' must repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larranñaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), is the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing the Academy of Hollywood in Spain this year represent a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de Mayo', nor 'Siete mesas de billar francés' nor the selected film 'Los girasoles cigos'.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
`At first you believe that you are working for the offspring, later you notice that it is only for the soul, and now you are satisfied if you have produced a film,’ Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón calls back the memory of the dancer from Sevilla Tortola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville honors a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Tortola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusierin (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert in Oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, a vegetarian, and set herself for the abolition of the corset, which limited the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left behind her traces in the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe during the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
`I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.'
'We're not trying to tell you about her life, but to keep her spirit,' said the flamer.
Your dance bases have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
"The dance of the schmetterling" came to me, for example, like Guajiira, or "the dance of the snake" like Tango.
Her dance was sensible and I was told that my dances are also in this aesthetic field, she claims.
The stage consists of two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will again sing for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in 'La porta openta'; and with Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with one of her ex-students.
`Matilde plays Tortola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to be involved in my work, and I feel very honored.'
The stage also includes musical composition and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the song of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he takes over the role of the companion of the artists, the divas in which he always fell in love.'
In this work we also tell a certain way about the life of this woman, who was known in as far-reaching places as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she normally lived in London.
I wanted to call her back in memory, because I think she's one of the women who have a huge influence on a certain age and whose works are no more today and therefore they're even less likely to appreciate,' says Bayón.
The performance will take place today at 20:30 in the theatre Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book 'Dario de un poeta reín cadado' also includes the trienium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Dario de un poeta reén cadado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married in 1916 Zenobia, offers an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the 'Thirenium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The goal is to remember the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the literary Nobel Prize and the day of death of both.
"The Triennia of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" will be concluded with the new edition of this work, with the international congress held in New York, with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the hiking exhibition "John Ramón Jiménez: "Aquel chopo de lus", which was opened in May and after it was in different places in Andalusia, New York is now reached and presented in the course of the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Dario de un poeta reén cidado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The goal is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet known.
Without Paul Newman, the U.S. may be ill.
Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in the "sensation reporter" and from the then dominant idea of the American cinema, which was left in the loop, from all over America to Newman with his exciting idea and followed her.
Now look what it cost her to give him Oscar.
And when he got back in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a great blow for everyone.
'What one feels at times is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,' said Robert Redford crying, 'my life and my country were the greatest horrors of his life.'
No one was afraid to laugh or overstep.
As the 'father' of the cinema and the fatherland, he died in a sad moment, in fear of terrorists and of market collapse, in which the defeated self-esteem of the US is on the hopeless search for reasons to maintain dignity.
If in this hard time, only a few people who can be admired remain without virtue, then you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he incorporated almost a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as well as various losses: from the foundation that directed itself to the fight against drugs and to honor his son from the first marriage, who died at overdose, was founded up to his own brand of domestic and organic products.
This is all a gift for the country in which it took a lot of effort to implement itself against a deadly food culture.
A wide range of surprises is worth taking home Hollywood regardless of nationality and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a man died, but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar award winner, said that working with Newman was no more or less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, was waiting to be called Newman's greatest inspiration.
'We have left the greatest of us all', confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who are faithful to living today as Paul Newman lived: receiving high demands on justice, a responsible private life, leading far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman was an example.
He was divorced once and was married to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, although there were certainly not many possibilities.
‘Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have a file at home?’ he often screamed himself.
In heaven he will be proud that his daughters on earth have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily usual in America.
'Of all the great roles that he played, he was not as proud as those of the faithful husband, the loving father, the attentive pope and the Philanthropy,' they said.
The streets in Madrid are not available for the Olympic Games.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some of the Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the defeat for 2012, it may still be 2016.
But I ask myself, ‘Are we prepared for this?’
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
It was called the perfect road, and after my assessment, it was the worst road with everything in it and inside it.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense if one would observe the evaluation and I could check it, that would clearly not happen.
But let's go through from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket hole that allows you to go as first.
I don't think it's bad either, but if they let you go, they should also give you everything (including chip to avoid the strain on the street).
So don't.
Here they let you get the ticket (the first nonsense there is only to go there) and (after an endless queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in the size `S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where are we actually living?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts from less fabric?
Well, things like these are a little compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a waiting line of at least 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave the backpack.
The waiting took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was also to be expected, the road began and we had not left our backpacks before, even if it had succeeded once, but it would be harder to recover.
It also looked to rain in this 40-minute waiting period, so it came to the attempt to organize a riot of the people and to invade the houses.
I think in the morning some 500 people will certainly have lung inflammation and some of the way I'm going to be due to this chip that I got, not even in time for the classification, I can already think that the output was misprinted.
Of course, if you asked me about a perfect road, this road would never affect me.
So I think we're going to dream for a long time from a city that's well prepared for the Olympic Games.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference' organized by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft is a route planner to move on the company's campus).
Thanks to a camera and a form and facial recognition system, these 'receptionists' can see how many people are in the room, who they are, and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the key words of their entertainment.
It can also bring the people into the groups after the talks.
In the presentation video, "the receptionist" notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not a member of the group leading her conversation, and that he is not an employee.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will be heard soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
That's definitely the future.
The company now has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked very superficially about Microsoft's change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computer were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling it with the commercial garbage, it would work five times faster. Man, Steven, this will be only for the poor.
Everything is just a statement when you think that Microsoft added some feature and `Extras' in Windows versions.
The Change of Direction Is Rewarded
Microsoft has the right, the operating system loses its importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared in the network, it was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Sent many indicate that the browser is not a operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary so that hardware and software can work at the same time.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to sharing something with his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of its 'death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People give less attention to the operating system every time, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to perform the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome, and every day we spend more time on surfing than in the 'window' environment.
What is the use of half in the computer of existing applications?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
The interest of Microsofts is more about integrating its online services, which can then become the alternative to Google.
Actually, they need it, no doubt, and I'll give you a little example.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, one of the relaxation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the refresher thread automat is a sign: `Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own online search tool.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of the employees at Microsoft used Google for online research.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was late.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, even 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso held it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Capri had this brand in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it is part of the clothing of a well-built pastor.
If we start to count the countless star performances, we can go back to the image of a very powerful man, with a sharp bart that had raised weight in a hiking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male T-shirt made of cotton, without sleeves and tailized.
The English speakers call it 'tank'. Lle Fabulux Marcel de Bruxelles, however, exceeds all other brands.
First, because of its great name, although it is called in the narrow circle `Marcel’. The legend tells that the name stand is associated with sport and came from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' surprises everyone because of its excellent cotton, because of its different Unisex cut and is distinguished by a small Belgian flag (unrecognizable) that have these T-shirts as a detail on the neck.
And attention, the Belgian company not only focuses on the production of 'tanks'.
You also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmere, cotton pants, T-shirts with strips, babies, mini shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it's very bad to use them as underwear.
They're very funny.
'I want to be a young mother. I don't worry about the candidate'
Her great performance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is kind, but full of joy of life.
At present, the Gruz brothers take their new activity very seriously in fashion.
For Monica, this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of Mango, leaving her home and making the presentation of the most important awards in fashion that sponsored the Spanish fashion house.
Compassion and fear, winner on the short trails.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also attended the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and shared the dinner with Valentinos.
A very intense working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, as well as I am fascinated by the movies of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I would like to go through a city and watch women how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, which I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but finally, everything happens in one and these areas have many commonities.
Since I was little, I was thrilled with the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to get around my aunt’s clothing and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a leisure park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to look at the clothes.
You know, we dancers like to have our own style in teaching and in the samples to look into the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you move into the real role of performer.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so much respect for the costume designer and its professionality.
You've been 30 recently, haven't you been in a crisis?
But what.
I feel better than I do when I'm 30 years old.
I find that the woman becomes mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I've done the things I've been doing since I was little, wanted to do, and this has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking of becoming a mother, aren't you?
For a long time, I have known that I will be a mother, because that is what my body requires and I want to be a young mother; I do not want to let that go.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
I'm going to convey great happiness to my child and bring it up with a lot of love.
As for film art, you keep in mind the work you took part in and the last year was turned.
That is exactly the case, and I would like them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman coming from the theater, am very impatient and impatient and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much wish that `La last hora' and `En busa de la tumba de Cristo' will be listed for the first time.
See how you like them.
A few days ago, you showed up on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
If you're okay, don't say anything like that.
It's not like I went on a walk to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a while, simply called me and invited me to London to take part in a parade for the welfare event of her organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes we show. I know that two pieces of clothing from our collection for Mango were raised to collect the money for Naomi NGO.
The people don't know Naomi's heart.
I, like the one who knows her, would tell you that they don't agree.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing that she is involved in.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this great thing, but when she comes and asks me to make a handle, I'll do it too.
To support women in the Third World, whatever is necessary.
The drivers who can be returned because of the alcohol level will have to install the 'Alcolock'.
The authorities suggest that the driver, who had three official penalties for alcohol abuse, installs in his car this system, which forbids him to start the car in a drunken state. If he is alcoholized, then the car does not start.
The initiative has already been announced in June last month and is already part of the report of the Attorney General’s Office. According to it, it is a pilot project that will last a year.
The aim is to resocialize the driver, so this is given a course for the retraining of traffic behaviour.
The Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Motor Vehicles will participate in this work, with the exception of the National Public Prosecutorate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers who were shown more than once because of driving under the influence of alcohol were again taxed.
The 'alcohol' would prevent it because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaust air and prevents autostart when the driver has made an alcohol test; or when an alcohol concentration is detected which is higher than permitted.
It costs more than 1,000 euros, the costs are borne by those who impose the penalty.
In this context, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices were already preventing up to 65 % of regulatory infringements in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved annually.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to engage in this behaviour before it becomes a criminal.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legal reform can be carried out in the ordinary way, yet a reform of the basic law is required which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is still available on the Spanish markets, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
In the morning, the House of Representatives will vote for the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
At 5:40 p.m., at the time of the program, next to the Presidential Hanger of the Benito Juárez de México DF Airport, the plane of the Spanish Air Force landed with the Prince and Prince of Asturias.
The sun went down, but their rays have yet to be forced to use the hand as a sunscreen to see the royal pair, which came out of the plane.
Direct at Gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and the princes of Asturias were visiting the city to formalise the official journey.
- Ah, very well, so you can't take people at the airport around this time you're from here or so
No, she's the Spanish, but she's lived here for a few years.
- Oh, that's good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and the Prince of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
There are many who are waiting in hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, also military protection of 27 soldiers of the Navy, who give the honours.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the Prince, with long hairs wrenched from the wind, without the usual 'peep-toes', may have been told that it is expected a wet in DF.
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official order is waiting.
At the door of the hotel, where they are accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican TV who likes to make jokes awaits her.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no significantly excellent fashion designers and Bonvivantes than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Boton-Mango Fashion Awards' for the promotion and international promotion of young fashioners.
This is awarded with a cash price of EUR 300,000.
Yesterday, Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings in the Mango Branch window at Boulevard Haussmann's 54th in Paris and almost won due to the emotional excitement.
In addition, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The biggest business is in London.
So many events have happened that you want to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury presidency at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board board, which was organized by Mango, seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by pain, because his brother had recently died, got together. He drew the suit from the fashion house and wore some jewelry from ELAH that were stunning. He stood at the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, to his honors.
Andik, the owner and Lord of the House of Mango, greeted the guests and was such a knight, so that he ended up with the Baron of Rotschild without jackets, because Jacketts lent them to the ladies.
Monica Cruz, had gone to business and had a dress and a shirt that she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. At a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a room for ballet samples, so she got excited, remembered the old times, took a stick and made a kind of 'grand pile'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the premises of the palace, but before she showed us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a person who always evoked a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own bed sheets and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, had prayed in advance to have a room without smell.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Council against stress
There are no 1000, but one more possibility to forget a chaotic daily life.
And even if there are few, they are all gathered in a book where there is how to relax. The book comes into the book dealing on September 30th.
The wecker is a punishment when he sounds at 7:00 in the morning, but even worse is the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that requires the current life.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to back pain.
The stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no one or two ways to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of turning off the world of work.
However, the number increases, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga settings, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the full list of options adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called ‘1001 opportunities to relax’ and thus comes the peace that the book conveys in the book dealing of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who believes that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as the workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual rejects such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered, how to stay in contact with nature or propose 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins is no longer high enough to restore balance of the body and stress has become a problem, then the moment has come to put yourself on the sofa to turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Talk in bed
Some children talk at night
I mean, not those who wake up and tell us something about what happened the day before, but the children who talk during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case, you'll be scared, but in reality it doesn't matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called sleep talk.
It is quite widespread, especially among children and young people.
Surely, more than one of you was told that you had talked at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in life, for example during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the child can remember nothing the next day.
There is no reason for this appearance.
Often relationships are sought with other appearances in sleep, such as alpine dreams, panic fear at night, Enuresis noctura (night beds), talk in sleep, but there is no reason for this.
As we mentioned earlier, there may be very high fibers, stress situations or overload.
Anyway, it's a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you speak quietly in individual words, flirt, or it may be quite a opposite (screaming, wine, long discussions ).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and to consult with a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes fear and thus comes to be.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnoe or with stress).
What can be done is a series of simple prevention measures:
Don't try to get the child to go to sleep.
So, choose a quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV programs that are scary and something too wild.
In the nervous children who are recommended to relax, relaxation methods can be used to help them gain some inner peace.
It helps the child to sleep quietly.
If the conversation occurs once in bed, try to keep the peace.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will not be able to remember anything that has happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you'll get it out of bed.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it relaxes.
Think about it if you become afraid after a few appearances, it is recommended to consult or find out what causes the child’s fear.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure on to perform a study and get more information.
So you won't be able to do anything about it, because when the child is asleep, it's unconscious and can't think about it.
Moreover, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says it, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe it doesn't tell the child that you hear that night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
That's causing a lot of fear.
So don't worry, it's nothing bad, that's a moment that takes just a few minutes.
Illhouses ... finally
After a long drought, Illhouses on the playing field are finally back to a successful course.
Without great effort, the yellow blacks played numerous torscos and made it possible to implement one of them and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers tried to show their ability, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose remote shot was almost at the corner, Illhausen should easily dominate the game, and it was the first to change the foundation figure with a remote shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the foot-tip to challenge the defence of Denmark.
The enemy team blocked in the middle of the field and left only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half should be decisive with first two Torchancs fought by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately with the first gate for the Illhauser by Marais, who was right to accept again a ball that was rejected in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the Illustible Torschütt should not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and be sent to the bank about 12 minutes later, so that his team teams would continue to play a large number of subjects.
However, Denmark did not know how to use this and did not face any major problems of an Illhaeusian Elve, which only moved back a little, to ‘debt’ their defense, except in the last seconds of the game, in which the ball after a big one was very close to passing the latte.
Sarkozy Meets Angry Fisher
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another departure to Brittany.
In view of the determined attitude of the fishermen who blocked access to several British and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to meet with their representatives there on Tuesday morning in the port of Guilvinec in Finistère.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit' and hope that he will come with 'concrete proposals'.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a general meeting of the crisis committee set up by the Breton fishermen to implement measures in view of the extreme increase in this price, which has reached an average value of more than EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the press speaker of the Elyséepalast David Martinon, the President will discuss possible solutions to help their company to become competitive again, and to ensure the working conditions and the payment of the souls.'
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning they led in Morbihan and Calvados Protestant marches, causing a staus of almost ten kilometers in length.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break down.
The Quiberon peninsula was separated by a barrier.
As early as Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning their tires and pallets from early morning before the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the canal, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishing boats did not export, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvre of the commercial ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique, in the evening, opened up the block of the significant total refinery in Donges.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting in the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec has to decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the discussion planned by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the national fisheries committee, which has not supported their movement.
'The strike will continue', for 'the fishermen will not be noticed at any point' and 'will not go to Paris', for example, said Liliane Cariou, President of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost about 50 cents, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman of the Wonderful
The unforgettable performer from `Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 following the consequences of cancer in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes agreed to the film player Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
This year, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer counts 215 aircraft delivered, despite the threatening recession, as a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, holds its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, 97 aircraft were delivered by the manufacturer.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects much from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft in the order of 30 to 120 seats.
To this day Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times, the insurance American International Group, which was financially supported by the US Monetary Authority, is considering spending more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the 85 billion dollars allocated to it.
AIG is willing to direct the sale of a large part of its business, via its international life insurance and age insurance in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of the AIG Sunday evening met to review possible sales.
The AIG could not be confirmed.
The assets of which AIG might be separated include its airline leases International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% of the re-securitised Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate and its investments in private equity, the FT further explains.
As regards these sales, no final decision was taken, the FT continues.
AIG needs to make the most of its sales to repay the loans of 85 billion that you have authorized the Federal Reserve, even at the risk that the US authorities will receive 80% of their capital and that the current shareholders will lose to the same extent.
Analysis Historic Paris meeting Historic morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the representative board had rejected Paulson's plan to save the banks, a historical case of the courses: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a never-ending loss of about 800 points, and the Nasday 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is reduced by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
With regard to the points, the strongest case of his history (684.81 points) was recorded earlier on 17 September 2001, the day of the trade decline following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final figure, the Nasdag index, mainly in terms of technology, decreased by 199,61 points to 1,983,73, and the widely distributed Standard&Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106,55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to save the banks by the Chamber of Representatives, which should allow for some stability in the markets again, Wall Street, which was already attacked at the beginning of the quarter, broke down.
On the other hand, with 228 votes and 205 abstentions, the Members rejected the funds he had requested from financial secretary Henry Paulson.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
`Here's a bad picture that makes the Congress unable to adopt a plan,’ said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market was counting on this plan," she added, and fears that a project 'too late' will come in several days.
‘If the project is actually doomed to failure (...), it will be a quick task of the Fed (the American Central Bank, Anm. d. Red.) and other central banks to get the crisis in the grip, which would limit the credit conditions even more,’ warned Brian Bethune, CEO of Global Insight.
And Ms. Piegza stressed, while she emphasized the feeling of extreme urgency even more, "that every day, he promises to bring the destruction of a financial company" into the United States."
After the Washington Mutual competition on Friday, the US authorities planned to purchase Wachovia's banking business through its competing Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated suddenly and led to emergency measures for banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets “not just a US but a global crisis”, added the analysts of the FTN Financial.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
The State Treasury's revenues fell from 3,632% on Friday evening to 3,827% on Friday evening, and revenues fell from 4,161% on Friday evening to 4,357% on Friday evening.
Obama, winner of points in the first television show
In the first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday, another one followed to find out who, as the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama came from.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in this television show to be followed by one third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although quite apparent, was not 'brillant' enough to allow him to stop his decline in election questions five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, which published an opinion poll on Saturday, according to Obama with five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the democrat is making the better figure.
In the case of the undecided voters, which is what is now happening, Obama went out with 39% as the winner of the polls, while according to a CBS survey 25% of them viewed McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his preference on Thursday with the good performance expected by his rival Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She's got good instincts, but this weekend Bill Clinton warned.
McCain, a 17-year-old, did not stop to focus his undisputed experience on foreign policy and clearly stressing his opponent's 'neighbourliness' on these issues, which were the focus of this first television.
'Sentor Obama doesn't seem to understand that...' he stressed several times.
'I do not believe that Senator Obama has the necessary experience and the necessary knowledge to become president', he also assured.
A point of attack which has been preached in the Republican polls since yesterday.
Obama himself emphasized that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely without getting out of office.
He put his ability to make good decisions and to renew the image the world has of the United States.
'McCain has still not understood, Obama by the way', this weekend set up a democratic election campaign against the Republican in which it was proposed not to have recorded the full extent of the crisis on the 'Americans from the street'.
'During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you', Obama called on 20,000 people yesterday, who had gathered in the rains of North Carolina on the occasion of an election.
He did not even mention the words 'middle state' or 'workers'. 'The financial crisis provides Obama, who considers the Americans to be the best to save the economy even at the edge of the background, a clear advantage.
'The next week could be a crucial turning point', estimated yesterday by the influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton government, compared Obama's 'good economic instincts' to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For democratic candidates, the current crisis is the final judgment of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain'.
Once again he stressed that he would perhaps even create a reduction in taxes for 95% of Americans despite fluctuations on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energies, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, was the top priority for him.
However, McCain wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates raise the questions raised on the plan to save the financial market of over 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which was adopted yesterday evening by the Congress and is extremely unpopular with the people.
Have you noticed that a choice took place in Minsk?
Youth and opposition protested Sunday evening at the main square of the Belarusian capital to deny the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred white Russians gathered on Sunday evening after closing the holocaust on Minsk market to protest against the deceptive character of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against Alexander Lukachenko's power: 'The dictator should return'.
Some admit that they haven't even chosen: ‘What does it use when they do it with my voice,’ says one youth.
They do not believe that the regime which has shown itself to foreign observers in the best light to resume negotiations with the European Union is ready to complete a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the non-participation of Visa for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the disposal of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
'We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the census', Juri Potemkin, the press speaker of the Union of democratic forces, lamented a heterogeneous combination of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, notes Alexander Milinkiewitsch, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and a leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who is counting the votes, and with us this is the executive.
If members of the opposition enter Parliament, they have been appointed and not elected.
But their admission to Parliament can mean broadcasting time, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.
The opposition is thus guilty of joining the political game, because dialogue with the European Union needs to be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis and we do not reform ourselves, we are in danger of becoming a Russian protectorate.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election process, does not recognise the election as valid.
It stresses that the electoral participation rates appear too high, and that the extension of voting fees in advance (26% of Minsk voters) has paved the way for all kinds of manipulation.
Have you noticed that a choice has taken place?, the leader of Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released this year in August.
There was no one in the lobby.
And there will be no more than five Members of the opposition in Parliament, those who are primarily in line with the government's ideas.
The silence of the night decreases again over the October square.
On TV, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Undermining - From blood that has become safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of its establishment, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it has regained public confidence, which has been severely shaken by the scandal of blood tried in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves administered by the Red Cross were contaminated during the 1980s with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus.
In view of this drama and the public's dissatisfaction, the Government of Canada conducted a public investigation conducted by Judge Horace Krever in February 1994 aimed at bringing light to the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to draw up guidelines to prevent a new disaster of this kind.
While the judge Krever was still reluctant to report, several provinces then set up a committee on the legs, whose aim was to develop a new system for the management of blood preservatives in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Kreber, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company, to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
In 1998, when hema-Quebec took up his job, almost 38% of the people had confidence in the blood conservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood preserves and through the work in this area over the following years, we have regained public confidence," she says, before she proudly stresses that by the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of Quebec's population had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary maintains in his consciousness that `trust is something extremely fragile'.
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has been acting in accordance with the principle of caution.
At this time, we experienced the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of bovine disease in Europe with, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman, who has been in charge since the founding of 1998.
And we didn't have the slightest idea if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
So we rely on one of the main guidelines of the reports of cancer and gélineau, which, according to one, applies exclusion measures, if one does not know this and if a disease progresses only slowly, as is clearly the case with the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from persons who had stayed longer than one month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, no doubt this disease was proven to be transmitted through the blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we have applied has absolutely a meaning.
In 1999, a much more precise technique for HIV detection appeared on the market: The Nucleic Acid Tests (NSTs) that allow the donor to directly prove the occurrence of the virus itself in the blood of the donor, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the previously used tests.
The NSTs allowed to shorten the incubation time between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be proven by our techniques in blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced for a period of less than one week.
So the risk that certain donors might be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize it, was significantly reduced.
These improvements allowed the risk of transmission of AIDS via a blood transfusion to a significant extent.
Today, one out of 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
In other words, this means that 12 million blood cans were to be distributed before someone was infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood preservatives every year, it would take more than 24 years before a case of HIV was transmitted via a blood preservative.
I think you can feel it today if you get a blood transfusion or write it down to restore your health," says Hema-Quebec director.
Our challenge for the next ten years is to keep our products safe.
You never know which pathogen can get into the system.
Just last year, on the island of Réunion, the Chikungunya virus was discovered, which, like the Westnil virus, is transmitted by insects over the blood.
We need to monitor immediately', Dr. Décary continues before she emphasizes that hema-Quebec must also provide sufficient supplies in addition to safe supplies.
'The need is increasing, because the population is ageing.
Because treatment for cancer is more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood supply network, of which on average only 3% of the inhabitants of Quebec suitable for the blood supply. '
Every healthy person who is 18 years old or older and meets the eligibility criteria, every 56 days, so six times a year, can donate blood.
On average, 14% of those who provide their blood are not accepted because they are ill with AIDS or malaria, and who are travelling to a country where malaria is spread will be excluded from the blood donation for a year.
With this 3%, we create an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Missing stocks are very rare.
But the members of this donor network must be renewed when they are older and no longer able to provide blood.
It is hard to convince people to give blood, but above all, to keep it and to bring it to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic today that you rarely find the time to spend an hour in the blood donation," laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec not only supplies blood preservatives, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart beats, eye drops and skin, which are used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are investigated, processed and frozen before they are intersposed to Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public nail blood bank Quebec.
In the nabel cord that was previously considered biomedical waste, there is a lot of blood on stem cells that can serve to treat severe diseases, such as leukaemia.
A few weeks ago, we celebrated the storage of our thousandth cord blood sample, and we plan to take more than a thousand each year.
"We should begin next year to make it available for transplants," explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of nabelsnurblut-absorption as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it', because hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semifinal
Montreals Impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 win (4 to 3 with all doors) against the Suunders from Seattle at the second and decisive game of the quarter final series in the Saputo Stadium, where the total ratio was counted, qualified for the semifinal round of the separation games of the first league of the USL.
The middle-field player Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive gate in the ninth minute of the game.
After a first half without a gate for both the one and the other, the middle-field players David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hits for the Montreals formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who set himself up as Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
We remember that in the first game of the pre- and back series on Friday Impact the Starfire Complex in Tukwila had introduced a 2 to 1-low in a place of Seattle.
In the semifinal, impact will be measured with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to compensate for a 3 to 1 deficit in the back game in Minnesota through a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps entered the semifinal round with a total ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
Briefly said - winner by Kovalev
The number 1 trio of the Canadian team is ready to attack the season.
Yesterday evening, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostsyn will launch the attack on the Panther from Florida with a storm fire, leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a door, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev turned a pass into this game, the fourth of the tricolore into six preparatory games.
Kovalev won the victory by shooting the only door of the entire shooting.
I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel good.'
`He's fixed too much on it in the first half, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he's got the end of the game.
He's been hit by a storm.
Charest lies on the north
The Prime Minister shall not refuse to hold elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the general meeting of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (Linke) is trying to be elected in today's partial election.
`Move the course of our last large border in the north': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levi, which followed all the guidelines.
During his talk, a kind of painting mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydropower plants, mining plants, considered by Quebec in `Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large funds as during the election period.
Against the press, the Prime Minister refused to exclude him from holding the elections this autumn, even though he claimed that his timetable was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'Vision' which the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely a 'new economic space' which provides for an agreement with France on labour force, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has often been mentioned in the Prime Minister's speech in recent years, the opening of the north - the northern area at the 49th latitude - has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was a `a jewel with enormous potential' but did not call a date, no investment sum or precise priorities for the upcoming projects.
At the most, some views on what could be worked more: above all on water energy, on the forest, but especially in the mining sector, favouring the growth of emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr. Charests, the North has the `nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This 'area twice as big as France' is near us, is in Quebec.
It's not just in our vicinity, it's in us, he stressed how to clearly show that he is looking for a national founder dream.
Quebec grew very much by its connection to the north, he stressed: the road to the gold in Abitib, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
`It belongs to us, it is our future’, he added, after having put in a theatrical break to look at the huge card behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec, includes a part of Labrador, which has always been called upon, the Prime Minister of the Press explained.
This is a traditional attitude that all governments have followed.
There is a line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time if the opportunity is offered, I will accept this position on behalf of the government again', he said.
In addition, ‘with climate change we need to rethink our vision from the north’, he explained and spoke about the Northwest Passage, which will be manageable due to the ice melt all year round.
In view of this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is precisely an obligation to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the natives and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very careful about them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létoureau (former Pakistani MPs of Hungary) have already started consultations with some thirty communities.
A ministerial committee led by Benoît Pelletier, where Julie Boulet (transport and land estimates) took up an important position, took up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, ‘not necessarily a summit’, but an opportunity where ‘man will create a common vision’.
The development of the North will, in turn, be offset in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
the North plan will be `talked, regulated and environmentally friendly', he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'Vision' as if it were a continuation of the liberal prime minister who was before him in office.
Like the Liberals who were before us in the office, we have thought about turning the challenges into new changes in growth and development.
This was, in addition to one of the ever-refused topics of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party for the 50th anniversary of the acquisition of the party by Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions adopted is to re-name the Beauharnois power plant in Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm.
'From Godbub, the Hydro-Quebec created, about reading, which reached the quiet revolution and the publication of water electricity, to Burrassa, who made the James book, our party always knew the future', said Jean Charest.
The press took note of another conservative project, this time on the program `Roads to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project Water Force Team Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
'That remains among us, but I have to be there,' he confided in his party members, which occurred in those crashing storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and of course also in 2009, has in fact not yet been able to hold this autumn's election, which is possible by law.
He stresses, however, that his timetable is complete, especially because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The general meeting of the weekend provided the Liberal Party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially those of `the constitutional objectives', which were adopted without further adoption: PLQ specifically calls for recognition of the 'speciality of Quebec' in the Constitution.
It would also like Quebec to appoint members of the Council of Canadian Radio and Television and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the guidelines of the Northern Plan were included with Skeps.
The leader of the Québec Party, Pauline Marois, reiterated the policy for the development of the North-du-Quebec, which introduced the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If she had done so, ‘we are still much more today’, Ms. Marois decided on the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has agreed to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
`But what we want is that this is not just going to be a big idea,’ said the party leader Sébastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont, who comes back from the holiday today.
Letters - A country of origin
Mr. Vic Toews, former Justice minister (which irony) in the cabinet Harper, it was the last summer he allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that she was an 'sand' for Canada.
This woman, who has led an unending struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration, to cover with shame, says just as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We have to do this with a government that, as the only person in all the countries concerned, has not taken them home from the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not even consider Omar Khadr to be even more young than the things that have happened to him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and leaves a child soldier under inhuman conditions.
The only one who goes down to a judicial parody to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that, above all, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers are calling for Omar Khadr to go home to get him a fair trial in Canada.
This government also closes its eyes to torture: It is of little interest that a young adult after so many years of chalk will certainly be broken for all time.
We are not aware of it yet, but we are just experiencing here a home-made cutting off of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that harper constantly wears a flag, and it doesn't sound so distasteful from his mouth.
Thus, the time has come when there is no more morality: a Canadian citizen may be deliberately abused, tortured and imprisoned, even after the well-being of a leader who is only supported by the minority (may be one of the minority after October 14th...).
Many electors believe to find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order. But they do not see that this government has given up what has made the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this dissatisfaction, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellic Speech of Barrick Gold
In her issue of September 17, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of Canadian Goldmine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and pursues an orwelling logic that the world's largest gold-making company sought to open up a public transparent debate over six million complaints against three authors and a small, medium-sized publishing house.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of slanderous complaints, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely obscured by Mr Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to drive everyone into the ruins, who is waiting to represent one of their opposing views.
Just as the process requires, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare for their defense and fight with very uneven weapons against an army of lawyers paid from the almost inexplicable pockets of goldmines.
The tactics of these unequal struggles are also often to ruin the defenders in order to force a consistent regime that causes the opposite to die and also frightens anyone who is waiting to re-examine the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things before the public opinion.
In contrast to what is going on and on in many of the countries where Barrick Gold is working, debates are usually carried out in Canada through the exchange of ideas and not by austerity.
So it would have been enough if the Goldmine revealed its books and records and opened up a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent testing teams that could have brought light to this issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have confidence in the public opinion and erases petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he could at the same time ask for a 'public' debate and, at the same time, miss the views of this public?
It seems that this word in the Vice-President's world includes only the extraordinarily paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very well-contained view of the concept.
In a democracy, the devious themselves have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does this primarily because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mines.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many people feel like a knobling (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just called on Noir Canada's authors, in which they ask them not to use this term anymore...).
Apart from Mr Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold's complaint is a direct attack on freedom of academia and the finding of truth that is fundamental to every democratic society.
She is absolutely right to quote credible sources and discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to explore and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has long known to get debate and disagreements in the grip and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate complaint clearly shows that she does not want to have a transparent debate, contrary to what it provides.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it will be time for governments to take measures that restrict this kind of unfair complaint.
Rescue for the Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand themselves
The Bush administration and the leaders, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached agreement yesterday on the largest economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan of over 700 billion US dollars, which is to stop the financial crisis, which has been threatening Wall Street for months, still needs to be adopted by both Congress Chambers.
The main contents are: Better control of the Members of the Parliament on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public funds used, new arrangements to mitigate the number of houses due to payment balances, as well as the right to monitor the fees paid to the managers of the assisted companies.
The US Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiations marathon.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be marketable,' explained the representative of the Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
`It was all done to protect the real economy and the American people from the crisis at Wall Street’, the Democrats explained.
"This is the fundamental point: If we do not do so, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily life of Americans will be enormous," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, because of fear of the effect that would have had a new loss on investors' mood.
The deadline agreed was the market opening this morning.
The two US presidential candidates, who were only late in the negotiations, showed themselves rather as supporters of the agreement, but without neglecting to express their dissatisfaction with the need to meet them in this extreme way.
The democratic Senator Barack Obama was in favour of adding certain provisions to the agreement, especially those which would allow the owners to keep their houses, and those which concern the salaries of the head of employees of the state-owned companies.
‘If you ask the taxpayer to take extraordinary measures due to the incompatibility of certain persons, that is nothing to which you might wish to be pleased.
But these measures are necessary', he explained to the American television broadcasters.
When he was asked on another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: `I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
The guidelines I have read show that this is a thing that we all have to endure, and with which we can proceed.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at the money of taxpayers
He comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the location of a real estate blast that led to the first collapse of the risk-rich mortgage credits (subprime) before it extended to other forms of expanded bonds (PCAA) and finally into a freezing of financial power and into the ruins of banks and money institutions.
A group of Republican Members failed last week's first attempt to reach agreement.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain 'toxic' assets of companies in need are only to be secured by the government and not to be purchased, one believes that the gas is out of the way.
In order to round up the perspective for everyone at the Congress, a provision has also been added that, if the government should lose this programme within five years, it could raise new taxes in order to retain the capital used by it.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added if the President sees it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be adopted in a renewed vote by the Congress.
In contrast to his help, Washington receives shares from the supported companies that bring him in the case of dividends, and which can sell it again when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to suspend the detention procedures for the apartments that are linked to the property credit covered by this plan and also to set deadlines for the repayment and accommodation paid to the managers of the undertakings concerned.
The plan's developers would have liked the House of Representatives to vote on it today, and then the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all her efforts, she is still not sure that her plan will get green light.
In fact, more votes against this project yesterday, both on the part of the Republicans and the Democrats.
'Unfortunately Washington does not understand us,' declared Republican Scott Garett, a member of the Board's Finance Commission, his electors.
"Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who exist to ask the taxpayers to cash.'
The democratic MEP Brad Sherman, leader of a group in the Congress called the 'Caucas of the Skeptics', represents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
'Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written us to inform us: we ask the Congress not to be put under pressure, and to carefully consider which way to be put in,' he explained yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we have again received evidence that it is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial publication of the Fortis Banking Group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The accession of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French Bank of BNP Paribas announced that it would refuse to purchase its competitors, which are in serious difficulties, since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis due to the risky real estate credit in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and belongs to the twenty-largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not a lost money,' said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
To compensate, we receive a right of choice and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savers and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are announced.'
During this time, the British government was on the other side of the arm's length channel just about to impose another bank under threat from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would purchase the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank the UK government has to state since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty with the blue eyes was his trumpet for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actress get rid of the Narzistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His feelings, his sensitivity, and an obvious talent have held him back from a position of power that brings to the world the truly terrible monsters.
But what a long-lasting runner!
On Friday at the age of 83, Paul Newman, who died of lung cancer at his rank in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he compared and for whom he had long been a kind rival on the lein wall, more careful in his performance, certainly also more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breakup of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as a son of a German Jew and a Hungarian-speaking mother.
Its European roots should be one of the spacious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality features.
Because in him a whole country, which was in love with the self-made man, was again reflected in the fighter who was injured in the Pacific War, who studied in Yale at the beginning of the 50s, and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York, before he had success at the theater, in television and soon in the cinema.
Even this man, who fought for the rights of citizens, was also the driver who became Mans Seconder at the 24-hour race in 1979, and also a sex symbol, although he had lived in a pretense with the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
He also disappears from the unknown aspects of this mysterious, withholding, committed and hypersensitivity star to the glamorous show business, whose puzzles will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newmans moved the cinematographers this weekend to Taumel, while on the dark screen of memories all his great roles were played.
More than half a century of American film art is constantly changing with it.
Then the charming Cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) represses into memory, and the young man who returned his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) to The Cat on the hot sheet roof, filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter memory (1990) will be called to watch over his sensitive Mr Bridge, who will be disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all of his promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A hand full of shit) by Robert Wise, a role that James Dean thought was taken back after his death and made the Newman correctly known in 1956.
This beautiful Ganove in the amazing The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit.
This face through the times, it was him.
He's still here.
In his life epochs unite.
The youth knows him from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in The Hudsucker Proxy of Brother Coen in 1994.
With a final role in 2003 as the path of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
In contrast to several filmmakers who have moved away early enough from the film world, Newman should stay in the satellite for a long time, and thus betray Hollywood, its assets, its Punk and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the 'underplaying' when he assessed his very expressive performances.
The metaer was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, who only flew the roles for a long time.
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotics, alcoholics, fieslings or doubts, with which he reflected his perfect performance and performance.
As director, Newman revealed unknown pages of his true fine sensitivity.
His Rachel, from 1968 (after the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife, Joanne Woodward, in the lead, drew a fine portrait of women full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott through an overdose, dedicated this 1984 his film to Harry and Son, a work full of emotion and sadness.
In the flow of gifts yesterday about Newman ergoss, his close friend and former gunmen Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid): 'His presence has improved my life and this country.'
Generosity and joy of life were essential qualities of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, he is now also a great defender of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, a opponent of the Hollywood demise, there.
We may have seen him with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, bakeries or other foods, and this made it quite tasteless, even though at first we found it funny.
However, the profits from its sales flow into its foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myths, Newman engaged to the shooting.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: `Always and to the end your father was incredibly grateful for his good stars.
It was an honor to be here.'
And for us, it was an honor to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
One of the most narrow and broad-minded citizens.
What was produced in the accounting factory of Supplement & amp; Co.?
On 8 October, the negotiations in the criminal process began against János' compensation and his complicity.
In particular, the accused is accused of engaging in organised crime, as well as grossly dangerous damage and fraud, and other criminal acts, including document fraud.
According to the Public Prosecutor, the funds obtained from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often charged with false accounts.
Government funds and grants from self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are to be part of the fund of the organization Fiatal Balldal, part of the private fund of each other.
As announced by the investigating authorities, fictitious invoices have been submitted in relation to the tendering fees, and the Associations should also not comply with their obligations.
According to the prosecution, most of the invoices were to be faked.
The invoices were purchased on the market of Józsefváros, the round seal was placed in Kisunalas.
The decision on which companies are to be issued the invoices was decided on that round trip north of the Plattensee, to which István Lados of János was sent.
In the course of this "exploratory tour", Lados should make up for pensions and restaurants.
He asked for invoices on consumption to be able to issue later on-the-spot invoices for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-government of Budapest.
These calculations are intended to have been manipulated mostly by István Lados and his complex, András ‹ri, which, after our information, should have been responsible for the drafting of the relevant reports.
One of the goals of Lados' "Expert Tour" was a beer hall.
As two of the invoices issued in 2003 are to be taken into account, the gastronomy company is expected to host the nine-year-old group of Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But the head of the company says that such a large group would not have been able to fit into the premises at once.
Another account, published in the summer of 2002, at the Jobb Jöv ért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évesredért, also revealed serious shape and content errors.
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and cannot accommodate more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are expected to stay.
The fantasy of the accountants was apparently not as limited as it was about the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company, in whose bookkeeping documents of the customers Job Jöv ért and Hoppá according to the prosecution authority did not appear at all.
As Managing Director Gy†zˈ Farkas of hvg.hu told him, he immediately realized that it was false documents when it was submitted to him by the Public Prosecutor during a survey.
"Our company name and tax number were wrong on the stamp."
And further: Apart from shape errors, the fact was also wrong that the company should have accommodated hundreds of people after having a total of eleven rooms, which offer so many people an impossible place.
The restaurant has also been in operation for a long time.
The taxable taxable persons have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel office which they took in the visa offers exclusively travel abroad, and thus they have indicated Hungarian travels on the cash account, which the company’s accounting practice also contradicted.
As has been known in the course of the investigations, they have also pointed to VAT on invoices, although travel agencies dealing with a country outside the EU are free of VAT.
The value added tax amounted to four of the Révfülöp Kft. invoices issued to the Job Jöv·ért Foundation were incorrect, as the operation was calculated instead of only 25 percent VAT, and only machine invoices were issued by the employees, but the fake documents were handwritten.
Another error that had occurred to the "accountants" was that they had indicated in one case "warningstransport" as a service provided, although this was not offered by the company specializing in investment advice, the public prosecutor informed.
Other forms errors - false accounting format, false stamp - were to say that the accounts displayed on Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as on XXI. Századi Kulturalális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be construed as falsifications.
Also in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managers judged that the accounts had never been issued.
Another "error" is the fakes at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This society was at the time (2001) just in a resolution when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator said, therefore, that the accounts had not been issued by himself.
Consciously False
The other group of accountants are persons who were fully aware that they had to lay fictitious accounts.
At the request of the Fiatal Balldal - Ifjú Socialisták, the Foundation of Esély Budapest Alapítvány has issued invoices for the Foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évesredért, in an amount of about four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of the Colllab Kft. was transferred to the exhibition of fictional accounts by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
The current biogate Kft, which is also in liquidation, will also have worked together with a supplement and co.: In 2003, the GmbH will have provided the Jobb Jöv ért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the Athlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenny have provided Egyesület with false invoices in the total value of HUF 5 million, which relate to unspent services.
However, there was also little payment traffic, as the accounts were destroyed immediately after their exhibition, but what the persons concerned had forgotten in their documents.
The third group of accountants shall include persons directly linked to the accused.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a company based in Budapest, but not located there.
This company will have issued several invoices for the sale of EDV components in the total value of HUF of around 18 million between October and December 2005.
According to the investigation authority, the cash investment Kft, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is expected to have functioned as the buyer of these accounts from Kisunhalas.
The manager of this company was a Romanian who should also be provided with company documents by Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov stood during the investigations, invoices on behalf of the GmbH. at the Atlas and Hoppá Associations, as well as at Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and have cast their own counter value.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the Jos-Investment Bt. are to be founded by Romanian walls on Iván Kubatov's express desire.
In fact, however, none of these companies were active, which, according to the defendant, was due to lack of orders.
However, he was able to benefit from the companies: At the request of his complicity, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was commissioned to prepare the company's submissions, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations linked to the grant, such as Atlasz and Y-Generació.
In total, Kubatov will have displayed 15 accounts in the total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade.
The public prosecutor assumes that Kubatov could have cancelled 10% of the amount of the invoice as well as VAT.
Kubatov should even have misused Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictional invoices - in this case the invoices were attached to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generácio and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért presented their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Tancsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but these amounts were used abroad.
To avoid this, they presented to the TMA five fictitious calculations of the Works Team Kft.
These calculations were also secured during the investigation of the Office of Arpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
In the course of the negotiations, some defendants are now charged with an opinion on the conduct of fraud accounts, as they have already been filed before the public prosecutor.
It could be a sensation if the main defendant, János, decided to make a comprehensive statement.
His previous statements were less detailed, and although he had already promised many times to tell comprehensively about everything, his statement still stands out.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him with regard to the repayment of most of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether a grant is ready to take responsibility.
But it is quite possible that a supplement is now playing the "injurious" after his attempts to soften the arrest and house arrest were thrown into deaf ears.
While other criminals who have suffered far greater damage and have not paid them, on a free foot or at least under house arrest, this possibility remains rejected.
The psychology of the area - or why we are willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overestimate the error offering.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic basis of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people in a competition, such as a rise in eBay, do not get beat and are therefore willing to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play Lotto, while the others participated in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the samplers were investigated through functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to earn money, however, an increased activity of the Strait, a complex below the brain, was measured at the loss of the auction, where the opponent's overlap played a major role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore considered that the increase in prices could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the space.
In order to undermine their thesis, the economists in the research group have also employed research to track the money.
In this case, three groups against a partner should be provided under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product and then made their interventions.
Another group was also promised $15 reward, in case they came out of the game as winners.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in the case of a lost game.
So the difference between the two groups was simply that the emphasis was on one on winning, while on the other on losing.
However, as evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the "against loss" group were willing to use higher positions than those in the control or profit group.
"These results cannot be derived from any earlier economic theory.
These are the behaviours observed in auctions so far only based on the joy of winning, or risk prevention.
The contradiction between these two theories was solved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so that we have now prepared a third statement" - said Andrew Scotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should you talk to your doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
However, the number of infected people is estimated to be hundreds of thousands, but only seven thousand are treated, which means that patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for hepatitis caused by various viruses, infectious liver diseases.
Symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common; however, the errors and diseases differ.
As a result, hepatitis A and E are distributed in two different species: in hepatitis A and E by the digestion tract (for example, by contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted by blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, secretion or mirror).
Travellers are recommended for vaccination against viruses A and B, and there is no vaccine against virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A are approximately two to three weeks after consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal pain and fractures.
Then the yellowing occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine is dark, and the healing can take up to two or three weeks.
Around the world, about 1 million people die every year from the more severe diseases of hepatitis B, such as liver cancer and liver cirrosis.
The main reason for this is that according to estimates, only every ten infected person is treated with medication.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: untreated it can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected don't even know about their disease, since the errant destroys the liver cells at home - in many cases the first symptoms are shown after 20-30 years.
Therefore, time-consuming precautions, such as regular checks, are essential.
There are three groups where this disease is more frequent: those who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
The number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is currently estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory study, it is advisable to consult the doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
In due course, the disease can be healed, the virus can be eradicated, thereby preventing the risk of infection and presenting cancer.
The World Day of Hepatitis is held on September 30th, 2004, for the first time on patient representations worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen awareness of these chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, their formation and the importance of early recognition.
Do believers have less pain?
As recent research has shown, religious belief as a kind of "sickness" has already been shown to have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: it was investigated how much the belief in God affects the pain of the human being, the British newspaper "Telegraph" reported.
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, every 12 believers and atheists received electroshocks while studying a painting of the mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to disable most of the pain.
By means of a brain scan technology, it could even be demonstrated that Catholics were able to activate part of their brain, which is responsible for pain control.
The study was the first in a research project, in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from different departments of the university participated.
In an attempt, the samplers were connected to the left hand, which gave the electroshocks.
The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: To one image of the mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and to the other Leonardo da Vinci "Dame with Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would trigger a sort of religious trance among the believers, while they chose a picture of her because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt as soothing.
The subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, and at this time they received 20 electroshocks in four stages, while they were supposed to view either the religious, or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they had felt at the sight of God's mother "in security" as if they were "uncareable" and had felt "peace and peace".
While considering the religious painting, they reported 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in front of them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the attempt, thought that similar effects could also be produced with other, highly effective images even in the atheists, one had to find only the corresponding photo.
"We had to find a picture that triggers very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," says psychologist.
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and it does so in many cases," Wright said.
After these excellent results, only the question remains what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the believers.
Would the high-quality young woman Mary achieve even better results?
You're what you're telling me about yourself.
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can claim with fug and right: it is found in the pockets of people just as about their heads in the sky: she knows where people spent their holidays, which doctors they go to, and what they are moving.
And that's still not enough, says Eric Schmidt, one of Google's CEOs.
In the direction of Skeptics, who are predicted by Orwell's Horror Visions, he can point out: They would just ignore the essentials of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently thought that Google’s main goal was to collect even more personal data about users and thus to get closer to the company’s original goal, which they want to “order all the information in this world”.
Schmidt explained that after ten years of global change in work, Google was still at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked for status Quo in five years Schmidt meant: he wished Google would be able to ask such questions as "What should I do tomorrow?" or "Which job really suits me?" to answer, however, software programs were not yet able to do so, as they did not know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches, search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the visited pages.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to store his own search history and then retrieve it later so that the results can be generated much more precisely later, and on the same logic are also based the so-called "recommendations", with which the system recommends tailor-made products and services due to previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the case of a data abuse - "If you look at what I'm doing" - some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company, which has an enormous effect on fear, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the desire for power, which in many Internet users is opposed.
However, it is evident that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties on occasion, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A parade example of this was the recent action against paedophilia in Brazil, in the course of which the Brazilian government's Google transmitted information collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also made it possible to identify the paedophilia.
However, to ensure personal rights, users were able to breathe up in May when Google, together with the civil rights organization, successfully brought EFF against the FBI: thus Google can also be forced to issue information to the FBI on a secret request in the future with no point of the Constitution.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully produced the issue of 50,000 Web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago, but it has been able to maintain the list of individual users, or their web and search terms for two months.)
Google's image therefore remains controversial: those who release their personal data are reluctant to use Google services to fear the loss of their privacy and privacy, and the company is emphatic to the conservative companies.
Indes sees the American "Geek culture", which is present in many countries and enthralls computer fans, activists and users, the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leader, even though both fight for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that Google does not require its users to obtain identification codes, and its services provide free of charge, so that an open, continuously updated source code and program package seems to be much more attractive, young and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the Geeks see the problem ratio of personal rights and the Internet dimension - a relationship that has been focused on the term "Web 2.0" in particular in recent years.
In the web 2.0, there is nothing else but collaboration, talking, leaving users deliberately trace and using the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are different individually, the main thing remains the same, that is to say, public.
At the same time, an average youth can manage his profile on several community portals - by Facebook via Xanga, they can connect it through other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can finally include all of this in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can lead blogs that automatically represent the latest photo galleries that are hosted by Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other examples prove: When you look at the party photos of the last night, the friend will soon find out with whom she has enjoyed her unfaithful friend, or the employee will be released, because in his blog he only makes quite honest about his problems about company management - one of which is sure: The term "privateness" has now been fully reinterpreted.
Whoever leads an online life is what he prizes from himself - in this way, for example, you could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever tries to keep something secret, or even run the Google Monopol, can do it well - like with Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google's search engine, but deliberately does not leave any traces.
Not few people intend to register not on community pages so that they are not found, but also the online applications of Google, such as text processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can be dealt with with alternative versions that are not linked to huge server parks and therefore not generate the best possible profile from the user.
The public opinion waits for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even in front of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising areas of AdWords/AdSense threaten the revenues of the advertising agencies, and the ever-increasing services introduced provide not only Microsoft, but also other software developers.
However, critical observers also find the disturbing opposites: For example, the Group Management rejected a protest by the employees after the fees of the firm's kindergarten were doubled, and the management considered the multiple maintenance of the employees to be too expensive. However, this is quite a good thing that in 2006 Google even went to the knees before the Chinese government and agreed with an agreement, which would be filtered out by all the regime-critical hits, or those who violated the good taste.
The Group's internal rules say that no new service will be sought in advance, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the coming months and years could again be very intense: While some believe that Google's book and magazine scan or archiving project will now take into account the extent that the company would soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are concerned about the "Health" system, which enables the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors already delivers the fabric - e.g. "Scroogled", the famous Roman of Cory Doctorow describes in a better orwelling manner a future in which a human being will be appreciable thanks to Google-related data.
Two young people help the double killer of Ózd in the elimination of the trace
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interviewed two young people who are suspected of having been involved in the elimination of the traces, the spokesman of Commissioner Borsod's police department said on Tuesday.
The young people were persistent, they are currently being accused of aid.
According to the news agency MTI, it is two girls who defend themselves on a free foot.
Aid is threatened with a prison sentence of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was investigated on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of having deliberately murdered several people from money.
In the course of the investigations, it has been shown that the 23-year-old owed a 53-year-old a larger amount of money.
However, the suspect did not want to settle his debts, so he dragged his believer on a site in Ozd last Wednesday, where he and his nine - year - old daughter murdered him.
According to the MTI, the man planned the act by long hand - this also proves the fact that he had committed the murder with a weapon hidden in the act.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the weapons and the circumstances of their use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange places a bid for Prague Stock Exchange
Around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered for the 100% purchase of the Prague Stock Package.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer that Poland had made despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the State.
However, 99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell more than 60% of the paper in the coming months.
Following notifications from the Czech daily newspaper "E15", the Polish offers include the highest purchase price offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far made offers.
Petr Koblic, Chief of the Prague Stock Exchange last week said that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owners, and he did not conclude that it could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of Prague stock exchange to 5-10 billion krones.
According to the shareholders' agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 per cent stake, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In its comments devoted to the ongoing international financial crisis on Tuesday, some leading European leaves have already spoken since "the second 11 September".
We have to thank the US President for the global financial disaster, for example "La Repubblica" - the President has not even been able to get his own party behind the draft legislation, which should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billion-thousand investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be necessary to speak of a "second September 11th".
Parts of the press in Madrid also place sinenbock in Washington.
According to the El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now at the edge of the collapse.
The American financial system threatens to collapse more and more, and it will bring suffering to the whole world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote at the Congress, the danger that Washington has not prepared a political means for crisis management is threatened.
The world economy depends in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, such as the Geneva "Days-Agreer".
Even so, some countries could provide their savings packages to their banks, and save banks with the money of taxpayers from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and there are no more banks to deal with, then neither further financial prices nor other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU Member States had to jump over their shadows and centralise control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid to weakened financial institutions, the Viennan "The Standard" recalls. Furthermore, the newspaper continues to be increasingly realistic that, according to Americans, European taxpayers should now take a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not taken the crisis seriously, which is now facing a tsunami over the old continents.
Although the "jurors" did not have to "wed" immediately with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable, however, to consider in which case it would be reasonable to collect the money from the taxpayers in order to avoid even greater damage.
Smart car simulates the flight of the sky
What would be the best way to develop new accident prevention technologies if we did not imitate nature's barrier sensors?
For example, the bees.
At the CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented that inspired the Nissan engineers of Hummeln to create new preventable systems.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic system controlled by Autoboters of the type BR23C, a mini-auto, equipped with the properties of the bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In the flight, each bee forms its own, oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protection shield", Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology-PR and research development, said at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bees, which can see in any direction and in an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role.
In order to reflect the function of the compound eye, the researchers come up with the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles to the BR23C in an area of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates its distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision prevention process.
The obstacle is recorded in second break parts, and the autobot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees, by turning the tires around the corresponding angle.
In contrast to previous systems, this manoeuvre is purely instinctive.
"If not, the autobot could not react quickly enough to remove the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the autobot project.
The system needs to react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the lowest and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer that is still inevitable within the accident.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of bees if they deviate from other bees.
And that has to happen in a fraction of a second.
However, the deviation, unlike the bees, can not go up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and it can only be in the direction of the turnability of the tires.
While the bees here are endlessly open to avoid other bees, the researchers were able to use only the rotational movement, or acceleration and braking.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are easier and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer life than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained, it comes to the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less to the processing of the data, and even less to the ability to store it.
This device must process only some inputs per second and respond accordingly.
It doesn't have to store these, or by using earlier maneuvers to produce an intuitive, logical reaction, so it takes on a hand full KB memory.
There's no need for gigabyte and megabyte-hard memories.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision prevention technology, which will be serialized in production after Nissan's assessment within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology at GPS satellite navigation, by raising the driver’s awareness of obstacles and thus leading him to the goal.
A name for the sinner child
Now there is the written version of the 700 billion-dollar heavy rescue package law, which will be applied in several stages and is aimed at buying the bad credit of banks.
In the first pass, half of the money will be spent.
At a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight on the east coast time, the congressional delegates, following a multi-day debate, reached an agreement on the 700-billion-dollar heavy rescue package, reported Reuters.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president of the U.S. House of Representatives, and thought that the agreement had to be brought to paper only.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson referred to the result: the program will be effective and it will be effective but more effective. According to Pelosi, it was not about saving the Wall Street, but about the noise of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. Washington Time Sunday, 8 a.m. (Middle European Time Monday, 2 a.m.), but did not trigger a flight to the stock exchange.
On Monday, the House of Representatives agreed on the draft legislation on the stabilization of the economy of 2008 and then the Senate is on the line.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news about the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made in the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, spokesperson of the White House.
The programme, however, deviates from the original recommendation of the Bush Administration, which should issue the 700 billion dollars once for the purchase of counterfeits, with loans of charged securities.
In a first instalment, half of the 700 billion amount is to be spent, with 250 billion immediately available after the Congress is expected to vote on the cause on Monday. This sum is to be spent on the purchase of credit taxpayers, bad securities, and the next 100 billion USD is to be decided by the President.
The programme will be reviewed by a Commission itself, which also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision of the Congress.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also use a combined tactic: at the same time, it can buy bad credit, mortgages, and mortgage-based securities, or other "toxic" credit.
As reported by the department, the purchase can be carried out in both an auction and directly.
The law enables the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the care-giving funds and the companies pay the expected damages.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds so that up to 700 billion dollars can be made available as immediate aid to the American financial system, whether for the large purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk caused by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We take the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, as Paulson says.
However, the heads of the banks in difficulty and now directed at state aid can expect to be cut short by the government by their manufacturings, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas slang.
A reduction in the fees will be made only in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each.
The reduction essentially means that if the department purchases an auction, the "Golden Handshake" will be taxed unless the retired bank manager is retired.
In the case of a direct purchase of the counterfeit credit, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the managers are not overrun.
It is also part of the picture that the existing Gold Handshake Treaties are not amended - the restrictions relate only to new agreements, so that more people can participate in the programme.
This is the first case in American history that reductions in managerial fees are regulated by law, the Democratic Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, commented on the measure.
The State gains participation rights in participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers is reduced, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the bank is better managed.
The draft law stipulates that the President must submit a proposal to the Congress in the next five years on how taxpayers should recover their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were both sides of skeptics who expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect from us, the plan does not protect the taxpayer's money at all, so the California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: The measures were preceded by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of the Wall Street.

No more visas in the United States since 2009?
Kingga Göncz sees good opportunities for the US-Hungarian visa agreement to enter into force on 12 January, as the Foreign Minister told the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In your view, "Now all depends on whether or not the electronic immigration control system is being introduced in time in the overseas. "
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permission in the new system, but the tourists had to register in advance.
The Head of the Hungarian Diplomacy has been conducting negotiations in Washington since today.
She meets with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will transmit the "Middle Cross with Stars" of the Republic of Hungary, and she will also conduct talks with the foreign political advisers of the Democratic Barack Obama and the Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue packages for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, pledged their support on Sunday for the 700 billion-dollar difficult rescue package for banks. However, there are also politicians who demand the withdrawal of the Minister of Finance.
The Congress and government representatives announced on Sunday that they had reached an agreement on the Bank's rescue package after long consultations.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the rise of the frozen credit market, have become the main issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claimed to be better suited than the respective opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
After recent surveys, Obama was able to further expand its lead thanks to the economic themes, while McCains Hoch, who has protected him from the presentation of Vice-President Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, was still silent.
At an election event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress would quickly adopt the law on the 700 billion-dollar heavy package.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passports of consumer protection that he has supported with.
"We have to act now, and yet responsible (...) - your jobs, your savings, all industry, and the stability of the whole economy are threatened" - he said before 35,000 spectators.
He did not fail to call McCain's economic vision "absolute".
In an interview given to the sender ABC, McCain stated: "Daran we will all have a hard time finding (...) but not necessarily an alternative."
The Republican Senator said that the plan also presupposes the establishment of a control commission for the Minister of Finance, as well as the restriction of manufacturing for the top manager - something he has been able to do.
The CBS said Obama, McCain would not have played a final role in the negotiations, against which he, Obama, was in contact with the Minister.
On Sunday, the speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, shared that the House of Representatives would probably vote on the bill on Monday.
The German-language press review
The right stock is intact, the only voters within the stock became conscious - so "The Mirror" comments the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (speel.de)
In the online edition of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayerns Revolution betrays its fathers".
According to the renowned politician, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein Huber-Duo took over his office.
The Christian socialists have renewed Bayern for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
At the same time, the epoch break is a problem of Christ democracy as well as for Angela Merkel.
Not surprisingly, the CSU disaster did not end on Sunday, but something came to an end, which was already quite accurate ten years ago: the unmistakable hegemony of a state party
Because 10 years ago, 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent and thus fell for the first time since the 1950s under the 50 percent mark.
This was repeated three years ago at the 2005 federal elections, which is still in the much-quoted Stoiber era.
The modernisation carried out by the CSU in the Federal Republic of Germany has, at the very least, poisoned their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but at the time it was estimated to be significant. However, without any impact, secularization, educational success, the closure of East and North Germans in the prosperous Bavarian regions could not remain faithful to the CSU voters.
Modernization is always a matter of choice, and that has political implications.
The right warehouse is intact - only the voters within the warehouse became more critical and self-willed.
It is noteworthy that in the last few weeks, the classic citizens' groups have expressed the greatest distance to CSU: the free professions, the professional citizenship and voters with Abitur as a university degree.
Here, CSU's support fell to less than 40 percent.
The Press (depresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily newspaper reports in its "Who with whom? Party leaders holding back on coalition issues" articles on the chaotic internal political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wishes to negotiate with the EPPS.
The OEPS prohibits the involvement of the SPÖ in internal matters.
The BZÖ shows itself open in all directions for talks, while the Greens do not yet want to determine a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything is moving around the coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the party leaders rarely looked at their maps.
SPÖ-Chief Werner Faymann reaffirmed his wish to negotiate with the EVP.
The SPÖ wishes to show that cooperation between the two parties is very much possible - in some countries and in the social partnership - this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current head of the OEPP as vice-canceller, was raised by Faymann.
As he said, the voters had chosen the Süssel-Motterer course.
A repetition of this direction is not in question.
Manyer has responded carefully to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he felt, when Faymann tried to get involved in the internal affairs of the EVP.
Whether his party is opposed, or going to the coalition, is currently fully open, and these issues should be discussed internally by the EVP.
BZÖ-Chief Jörg Haider showed up in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are prepared to take on government responsibility," said Haider.
Járóka: The devil's circle of poverty and the segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, which is being set up today by the EU Presidency of the Council of France.
In her speech addressed to the plenary, Mr Járóka, Members of the European People's Party, in particular to the education organisation, paid attention to the fact that this is one of the most serious violations of the law that the Roma children are facing, and that is also the greatest obstacle to their need for validity.
The high-ranking conference was opened by French Employment and Social Minister Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The participants included representatives of governments, European social partners, as well as the most important European legal and civil protection organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As Fidesz's EP Press Office reports, Járóka pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in job search, Roma would be forced primarily because of their low level of education from the labour market.
"The vast majority of Roma youth have no secondary education, and because of poor primary education, only a small part of them can reach a university degree."
Járóka further stressed that education was a fundamental human right, which played a key role in the realization of other human rights.
Investments in early training of Roma children could boost the economy of the EU Member States.
In the opinion of the honourable Members, it is important that this relationship be made aware of the widest possible circle of Roma and non-Roma.
Because earlier a Roma student starts school, increasing its chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; and through income and income tax, they contribute to national spending.
"As citizens of the Union, Roma must be guaranteed the right to high quality education - the poor and segregated teaching must be introduced" - says Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member has said, a common, objective and action-oriented approach of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the deregulation process in the education sector, and it is essential that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives be properly adhered to.
"We must break through the devil's circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as a fully eligible citizen," Járóka asked.
Since the Berlin Congress last year, the summit will be held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the promotion of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European, but also national, levels within the meaning of the European Year of Equal opportunities.
CSU: Pleasure on time
At the end of October the fate of the fallen Duos Huber-backstein will be decided
Despite the election bench, there are still no heads, at the top of the Bavarian CSU, the personal debates were held.
President Beckstein and Chairman Erwin Huber are still in their offices, the question is just how long this grace is worth.
On the fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17-percent vote loss, the last weekend of October will be decided at the extraordinary party.
However, the much trained duo has already made it clear that it does not want to stick to their seats.
They want to address the angry group and the party base, which one day after the "Bayeric Tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority of personal consequences.
Five years ago -- admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at his high point in career -- the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent. Now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, however, they could only secure 43.4% of the votes.
The CSU was a 46-year-old "alleinregier" in Bavaria, which produces 18 percent of German GDP.
While the Conservatives remain the decisive force in which the Hungarian economy is also important to the southern federal state, they will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the internal restructuring, the potential successor of Huber, Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the research team, which will lead to a possible Munich coalition with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "Free voters".
One irony of fate is that with the list "Free voters", Gabriele Pauli enters the Legislature, whose anti-stobes appear the Huber-Beckstein Duo has first taken advantage of, in order to view the goalful politician freely.
The CSU leadership now concentrates all its forces on the stabilization of Becksteins.
In this transitional process, Stoiber, who has so far taken the threads out of the background, will become an active player. The former Prime Minister and CSU president called on September 28th the "big day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made some toxic remarks towards CDU - in his view the CSU would have earned much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has contributed a great deal to success at the national level in 2005, is not put back on its legs with a common force, Merkel cannot be a chancellor again after the German elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has not made a cure from her disappointment over the Fiasko, believes that the land loss of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the large coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD has achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukaschenko Opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, there was no representative of the opposition in the Ukrainian Parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is the state of prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukaschenko, but the OECD suspects that there is legislative contradictions in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
The legislature of the 10 million resident state has come out without opposition for decades. Nevertheless, the opposition party (ODS) has seriously hoped that Lukaschenko, who has renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time in 2006 in the midst of the unholy elections and a change in the constitution, would "allow" this time some members of the opposition in Parliament.
That's why the ODS even distanced from the pre-planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming more and more dependent on the increasing prices of gas imports from Russia, and even credit has been taken to alleviate price increases, and the country has also agreed to the Russians to sell the Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading by the country. Thus, in the light of the opposition's expectations, Ukraine was hoping to improve its relationship with the EU, after Lukaschenko and other high-ranking politicians have banned entry as an anti-democratic political system in the EU.
For temporary relaxation, the OECD election evaluation report, in which emphasis was placed on the positive movements rather than on the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's rapid report criticised the campaign already Monday - therefore opposition should not appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition should not be present when counting the votes.
Despite the fact that the opposition has been able to recognise an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been placed on a free footing, and Minsk is even more willing to confront Moscow by continuing to reject the recognition of the independence of the secluded Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federative state on the paper, has been considered independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one back, but the most important is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkewitsch to our paper.
According to the 2006 presidential election candidate, a continuation is desirable, although "the mighty fear of leaving only one opposition to Parliament".
The opposition does not plan protest measures in view of the results, but rather attempts to clarify the need for an economic reform to the voters.
"We have a lot of problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting us in the way of selling stones, but I see that more and more people support change, even older ones," said Milinkewitsch, suggesting that not even the most supported layer of pensioners agree with the Lukaschenko regime, whose sole merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the debt of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the "social security" that begins to crack at the silence of a cemetery," said Milinkewitsch.
In contrast to opposition politicians, Russian observers have referred to the elections as democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, Head of the Mission of the Community of Independent States, stated the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe the facts, not the words." The absence of the opposition was therefore proof of the tires of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, it's getting early"
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are rotatable doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
From now on, the measure will enter into force against those slummers who will only stamp out and then go for coffee drinks during working hours.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Act was presented today by Renato Brunetta, the Minister for Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
">"Treatable doors are a means to increase labour efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism," explains Brunetta once again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all the buildings of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
Masi refers to this: "the choice of the rotatable doors is also of great symbolic value".
On the part of the officials there was no resistance, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides".
All in all there is now no breakfast during working time; close with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas talks about this with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the High Committee of the Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Administration)
from Rome, the Minister announces that "within three months the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, which is 60,000 people per year more present at work".
He added that it was necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the public administration of Italy
"their pay dynamics - so the Minister - have been twice as large in the last 8-10 years as the private sector and far above the inflation rate."
In the meantime, thousands of officials have joined in opposing the Brunetta Decree as part of the call supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister for Public Service is profiled with numbers of lower absences at work - as the consumer centre writes - the people of the 'active faulpelze' grow uninterruptedly.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable officials of the public service have joined in declaring war against the law."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related diseases, and the planned extension of the compulsory residence of the sick worker, during which checks can be made and further aspects of the Minister's innovations, will be called into question.
Napolitano: "Prevention against accidents at work is crucial"
Every day there were 2500 accidents at work in Italy, three people died and 27 people were left with disabilities.
For 2007, the data of Inail (Instituto nazionale contro inforuni sul trabajo) confirm that the fatal accidents at about 1200 occurred.
These figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as are caused by murder.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will take place in all Italian provinces on the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work in order to draw the attention of the social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The concerned, the data distributed by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm the crucial question of prevention at work," confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del trabajo) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to the prevention of jobs, the protection of injured workers, the aid for families of victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"An embellished "Basta" has come up to this; of course, in tragedies that, measured at their size, trigger some spikes in the media and public participation. But the everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even be repeated in their own dynamism."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is also a resource problem at all: there must be a decisive investment in education and information."
The numerous initiatives to raise awareness in school frameworks are of particular importance for young people who are approaching the world of work.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not to detract from its social seriousness.
On the other hand, the President of the House, Gianfranco Fini, stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths is an urgent social emergency, which affects the conscience of all of us and forces all of us to work on specific rules that aim to put an end to the problem".
"The data on accidents at work seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not mean that the number of deaths at work is too high," says President of Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive trend" to mean less attention. That's exactly what ultimately causes tragedy."
"How do you think you're actually doing too little to deal with the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight against different actions.
Stronger controls and inspections are necessary in our opinion – Mercandelli, but also stronger measures to clarify workers who are already starting in school."
"An additional effort is necessary - as he adds - as regards communication and public awareness.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers is asked about a phenomenon which is a social emergency."
Mercandelli also referred to "the progressive deterioration of protection for victims of accidents at work" and called for "the abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give the worker a guarantee of insurance so that the fate of the victim of a work accident does not depend on voluntary or random donations that are decided by a legislator from time to time."
Mp3 player in charge: danger of hearing damage
Listening to music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
The European Commission, which is quoted in a report published today in Brussels by Csserri (Scientific Committee on the current and recently identified health risks) of the EU, reports this.
"Out of the report – that is, in a note – it is clear that 5-10% of those who hear music with portable musical instruments for at least five years longer than an hour a day risking permanent loss of their hearing."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who usually put portable music devices and mobile phones on a high volume, their hearing without knowing it irreversibly harms them," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific findings – that is, from the eu – there is a clear risk that it will be too quick to act.
What really counts is to sensitize consumers and make this information about the community.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine the existing control systems in order to be fully effective and to take steps with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music equipment among young people.
"Scientists - so concludes the EU's communication - confirm that you are too concerned and that the European Commission will, together with the other members of the European Union and those concerned, examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise that comes from portable musical devices and similar devices."
There is already a European standard that limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB. The concern about the damage that could result from a heavy noise load.
These damage can be very limited in which solutions such as noise reduction and the length of noise exposure can be achieved.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of the Eu points out that when users of portable music devices hear music only five hours a week (less than 89 decibels) so that the legal limits are already exceeded which apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who cross this border risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
So this is 5-10% of the users of such devices, whose number can be estimated between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the Eu.
Rome, Germano gives the opening committee for the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We start today, in March it will be over, in June it will be taken into account.
This is the end set by the chapter for the work of the "Commission on the Future of the capital of Rome". The Commission met this morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla terms.
In six months President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the city and municipality council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the capital and the mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," says Germano. "It will make proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders remain in charge of the city and community.
There is no new distribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where you can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, their task will be completed and the Commission will be relaunched, as such a project must have a temporary end point.
In June, as the mayor announces, we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work carried out by the Commission."
Those who question the competence of the Commission because their view of obligation is lacking, to Germano says: "Everything depends on the work which the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, like in France, she delivers quality results – and this will certainly be in Rome – then her contribution will be fundamental.
The policy is too often concerned with the daily problems and emergencies that arise from time to time.
On the other hand, we want to have a longer period in view to work seriously with a deeper perspective on the development of Rome and the future of the city."
The mayor of Rome values the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a fraud: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will bring us to mind. It will occupy the best heads of the capital".
According to Alemano, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan which is neither hermetical nor static to allow our city a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus to take a common step into the future".
A future, the mayor of Rome, which "will not only restrict itself to the present municipal boundaries, but will continue to be much more visible", not only as regards the role of Rome as a metropolis and the political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here's a statement
A well-known American politician, much to be seen as independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will become the second anti-American president.
The first one was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, derailed the U.S. economy and maintained the relationship with the established Islam (and still does this as a private man today).
The attacks against Obama are getting stronger, right now, where the elections are approaching.
A woman from Miami wrote on an Internet site: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very cool: he thinks he will be given the highest office of a nation that has seen in total two black governors and five black senators!".
However, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win with a great advantage.
In this case too, people are there who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in her editorial: only in the polling room will we know who the true American patriot will give his voice.
Here comes a mentality of the United States, which has been kept hidden until last.
"Say what you want, then we'll decide for whom we'll make our crosses, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people there who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Something you never heard before – just now, where the success of the black candidate seems so secure.
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the ultimate weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What mistakes did Bush have during his term of office? 89% replied: The war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back home with a walk in the back.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weakness.
The one who will take his place is faced with a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse leaves its mark even with journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
Fifty-five American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about their situation and mental control about the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they explained that the information concerning the competent authorities was not really concerned about the general credibility.
They don't feel as alone as before.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems arising from the cuts in the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work, in order to assemble the newspaper.
It is a problem that needs to be solved – so the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the big audience understands it, from shrinking substantially.
A clear but complicated pessimism fills the American journalist today.
Six of the ten journalists and executive seniors of the press believe that journalism is on the wrong track at national level.
In the local area, the executives are even 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine which direction the web is going in.
The main publishing groups are on their way to the Internet, which is viewed by many as the "killer" of the press.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to wanting to join the new technology, hoping "they will bring some good for journalism".
The biggest rice is in American journalism today between the chief editors of the newsroom and the reporters working for them.
56% of the chief prosecutors at national level are sure their reporters share their values with them, while only 23% are at local level.
Some think it has to do with the "security in work".
The managers who are afraid to lose their work within three years are 47% at national level.
Of the journalists, there are 30%.
The theme of "safer work" in the team (our "editors", etc. Red.) is always a current theme in the United States.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, such as the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV broadcasters and Internet operators, employers offer as they like and so it will be a question of taking it or leaving it.
The chief editors get very often very high wages, and the editor can sometimes only get 10,000 euros per month, including pension and insurance payments.
As far as holiday is concerned, the matter is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, as well as so many after the third, to reach after a certain number of years 15 days of vacation.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, will often be "sick" during the year.
It's a question of climate.
UNIPOL: GERICHT IM ROM: DANILO COPPOLA LIMITED IN GROTTAFERRAT
The President of the Second Chamber of the Court of Justice in Rome, Carmelo Rinado, decided to reject the application of the real estate broker, who had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola because of its bankruptcy in the context of the counter-agreement investigation in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the process against him during the last week, his dismissal from the house arrest was turned into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate broker to be transferred from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the Court of Justice, such representations (against which the Public Prosecutor had spoken) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and to obtain evidence against him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already appeared a few days ago when the Chamber of Representatives voted against the 700 billion-dollar savings package of the White House: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than the economy.
This confirms the Struggle edition of the New York Times, which reports how the crisis in the course of the course of the Republican Party, which is increasingly fragmented in its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favored the state institutions and the business community and those neoconservatives, which are hostile to "those in Washington" and the financial world, and, for example, wins in the south and the centre of the States voters.
This part of the party thanks its rise to, for example, the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This just mentioned example is just a small part of the major changes that announced or even represented the current economic downturn: not only in the United States, even in the whole West, but perhaps beyond these will be affected.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the long-feared events that finally take shape under these new conditions and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the discovery of the uninterrupted renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in the banking and financial institutions that have close connections to the rest of the world and at the same time manage an immense amount of the assets of private households living in a single state.
This means an immediate political problem for the governments: how to treat the families concerned, which is also a huge voter mass.
The crisis therefore appears economically global, politically against it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have turned aside and lost its right of speech: the clear evidence for this has been given by the EU, which, due to its duplication in various national and international conflicts, does not know how to find a common way.
Therefore, all of them are now counting on the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, for example, the distribution of aid funds: since the crisis has become more and more serious, only the United States can save itself in the economic situation without foreign aid.
In addition to the funds, they also have the legitimacy to use them: therefore, two non-overestimable conditions – under certain circumstances – which may not otherwise be able to withdraw from the international organisation or market in a similar manner.
The new emphasis that is placed on the state-national element is, in addition, perfectly consistent with the ever-increasing importance that is recently linked to a more closely related sector in the economy: territoriality.
Paradoxer's way is now, when we were so convinced that we had to become part of a networked whole, in a realm of ever differentiated technologies, of immaterial that we have to find at once how our future will increasingly depend on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
Although they can all be transported from one place to the other in the world, they are still very closely linked to a piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the one who has such a territory is in favour of another living in a land free of waste, waterless or oil-free.
I am now coming to the second news, but it is a brief introduction.
Who's territory, who's government, who says politics, that's what Leadership says.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge about the need for leadership, so the need for someone who knows how to handle things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of equipment on existing routes, e.g. those of the economy that have emerged as insufficient and full shadow zones.
In addition, a deeper richer and in a certain sense even more disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, an indictability, an image of insatiability, a feeling of distance that is all about a whole class of managers of the western countries.
It seems, therefore, that the belief among many parts of the population is to pave the way that it is not only the deeds of the social elite, but it is already their idea world, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is the majority as always abroad and more transcendent.
The demand for leadership is therefore undermining a slow but powerful movement of the leading class and of the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in the unforeseeable "revolving" of voters and in the unmistakable change of the collective mood of the past: beginning with the rise of conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, over the collapse of the Labour Party in Great Britain, towards the rebellion of US MPs against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the rights in Italy is a role here).
One wins the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, magazines, intellectual believers, some would say their format, increasingly problems of understanding and therefore less representative value in terms of what is happening today in the lower social layers of the West and is still being reinforced by the financial crisis and driven to over-dimensionality.
In view of all this, it would simply be exaggeration to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping the eyes open is certainly not.
The superclipper that leaves the walls up to
The forces of gravity can be overcome by a adhesive and can climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four U.S. research centres, one of which seems to be almost aimed at.
With an area of only 2.5 qcm glue, the researchers managed to fix a 100 kg heavy body on a vertical wall.
STUDIO – has an American magazine, has published the results of researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which uses a special carbon structure called carbon nanopipes.
"The principle of glue can be represented as a series of ordered tubes to a stack of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic herbs, which give the animal a perfect stop.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass teflon and paper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the standing capacity of the feet of the Reptilians and at the same time "free from the wall", says Liming Dai, researchers at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
AN MAUERN ENLANGWANDERN? "This material could be used as a transversal adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Somehow like Spiderman go to the walls? Maybe already, but researchers are thinking of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanopipes are also leaders of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall within the area of space transport.
So for the moment, the superheroes still have to wait.
THE OTHER ART OF RESEARCH – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new kind of glue.
In an article of the American Chemical Society, the California scientists present a glue of microfibres that clean themselves like hair by moving on a surface of dust itself and thus maintain a perfect liability.
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness in the summer, may cause serious health damage when taken with certain vital medicines, as they can affect the absorption of them by the body in extreme ways.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of packaging as well as fresh fruits in connection with drug intake. As part of the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he once again sounded an alarm: There is enough a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital drugs to the extent that they are practically eliminated and the health of patients is threatened.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some medications such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovasculars, anxiolytics and neurologicals, to toxic levels.
MEDICINAL PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS – The same Agency for Medicinal Products had warned doctors and patients two years ago about the risks of this combination and emphasized what to drink in conjunction with medicines such as Diazepan or methadone.
ES IS NOT GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice contain substances that may inhibit medicines.
The list of active substances hidden from fruit juices is long.
Therefore, the call by Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually passed immediately on to the various international manufacturers, who are so free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended that you always read the package leaflet and, if there are any uncertainties, do not have a shadow to ask a pharmacologist or doctor," the Ansa Agency expert stresses.
Economic Noble Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The economic prize is for the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the establishment of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event was more crucial to the history of the United States than the Attitus.
A forecast that did not receive little controversy in response and that the economy was still held years later, but it is now quite right.
"I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals in the framework of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public view," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economy of great value", but also a banalist with a "very aggressive style which is particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, the third version of the Anti-Microsoft package appears
The day of publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the Open Source software wins as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office an ever-increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among liberators and in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presenting itself with some news to the public: in addition to a revised and now Spartan-designed start-up menu, it is now finally one of the reasons for ensuring compatibility with Apple's Mac OS x operating system, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
Eight against the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as the one that allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which facilitates sending via email. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files into the graphical editing module and at the same time to preserve the original appearance image of the page.
Thus, "hybride" PDF files can also be generated, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format to the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the strongest elements of the applications: tables can now be processed by several users, thereby avoiding conflicts in the case of changes; in the case of the text processing system, each editor will be asked to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are just about to publish various functions of OpenOffice online (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks the final result will be made public.
The Italian version is available on the following link to download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. It follows the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
Besides for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
Upon request, you can send the installation CD home or to the office.
If freedom of charge can be an incentive for the distribution of the program in private households, it is also in the business area where OpenOffice could succeed: in the end, various public administration and schools have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus opens business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the word corresponding to the text-making program; Calc, the table program aimed at forcing Excel; Impress, to create presentations like with Powerpoint; Dbase to operate databases instead of the more familiar access; and lastly, Draw, a graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded by 3 million and 600 thousand already reached.
Also coal tested positive and thus the fourth doping case
It opens up a new doping fall within the framework of the last tour of France: it is the Austrian sportsman Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is the third-class winner and winner of the best climber's shirt.
The message published the daily L'Equipe on her website.
The 26-year-old coal from team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver tested positive for Cera, the epoch of the third generation. Previously, this was done by the Italians Ricardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as by the German Stefan Schumacher.
The blood samples of Kohls included those performed in the last few weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
Confirming the positive results on Cera, the Austrians will lose their third place and will be excluded from the race for two years.
The chief of the French Anti-Doping Commission Pierre Bordy confirmed the positive epoch, and reportedly also the Austrian authorities, according to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrian came behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans on the podium and also claimed the trikot of the best climber for himself.
THEME OF INSTRUCTIONS: THE NEW YORK TIMES: IS ITALIAN RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the single country of immigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only taken up by opposition.
Does this make this a nation of racists from Belpaese? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article devoted to the whole issue of racism in Italy and out of the case of the young man, Abdullah William Guibre from Burkina Faso, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after he had stolen a pack of cookies.
The case illustrates what the Times refers to as the "paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and employment opportunities" are, and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiment and the highest support of the North League".
As confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times refers to other episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the lega against immigration and for the rapid expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as signs of climate change in Italy.
A movement that also underlines the Pope and the President of the State: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal to cooperate between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900 Euros per room high rental prices
The market for apartments for students does not know any crises.
According to the last study of Sunia, the rental agency, a single room can cost up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken very difficult moves. A lot of students lose their right to study so effectively, as their families are not able to support them in this amount" – according to Sunia, Laura Mariani – "in these cities the great demand from the students leads to a deformation of the market which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, lack of registrations, without price limits, unauthorized tenants.
For Sunia, there is the need for exceptional measures leading to a revision of taxation at lower rental prices.
For more detailed consideration of the investigation, it appears that in Milan a sleeping space is required in the Brianza district of about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Nere district band) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district, or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, an average sleeping area costs 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students focus in the districts around the university, 250/280 Euros are for a sleeping area of needs, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the quarters around the Union are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bedroom in a double room.
Only a little deeper are the rentals in the districts around the other universities of Rome: 550 Euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those in the outside district can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping area and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping area, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive areas, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a sleeping area costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, as in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rental that is 25-30% above average is required by foreign students.
With a view to the old Kino Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinema halls
Historical cinemas are closed due to the favored multiplexkinos.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This image of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is happening in the large urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of demarcation of the cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-saal complex in the periphery, means long-term death for the single-saalkino in the center. A process that not only appears to be impenetrable and irrevocable, but also carries the transport of a cultural crime.
Most of them are historical places full of memories, "it's like losing a friend with whom you've returned a piece of road full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who brought him the Oskar and the great price of Cannes 20 years ago. It's about the story of a pre-city cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a probably forever lost cinematel.
The figures supplied by the Anec, the central trade union, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the untimely quantities of 316 traditional cinemas have to be closed; these cinemas have paid mostly the cinemas in the big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions include Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This proves that the main debtors are the multiplexkinos, because they are just these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, the Lombardy leads the lists, 81 are both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "it is useful that new structures also occur, but the first thing is that the preservation of the existing one, because closing a hall in the city, is not all of his family's customers are willing to visit a multiplex cinema instead of the old one in the periphery.
And here, there is still the missing state for the commercial association fund: the debt burden shown by the State is about 10 million euros.
It is a violation of the ethical-moral position that the government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to obtain the sector, between EUR 16 million and EUR 18 million would be needed in the year".
It is interesting to note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, because of its fear of the old cinemas, has decided to protect them through an agreement between the community and the Anec; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy, which aims to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
The measures envisaged also include tax advantages for cinema operators and benefits for the public in relation to proximity: it will be allowed to drive in the traffic restricted areas of the centre and also to park at more cost parking charges.
"It is a happy initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and also develop new concepts.
But of course, we also need better audio and video equipment to be able to focus on the superpower of the multiplexs, because the audience of today is more demanding.
The defense of the traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "supercinema" of Bagiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to establish the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso" even though I had been playing with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I have been living in Rome; if I go through the Rialto or Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side so that I do not have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was prepared to adjust the community's decisions to the interests of Mafia Group Piromelli.
The charges against mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy representative Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for the development of mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromelli, the senior mediator between the clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew, was also taken into custody: the lawyer, who bears the same names as the boss of the clan, had already been convicted for the development of criminal associations of the Mafia, at that time to an amount of EUR 10 million.
"Any kind of moral and legal norm," the lawyers wrote, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromelli money for consulting activities."
"So it was possible for the Mafia Group – the judges – to formally enter the councilhouses and agree on public administration policies."
The president of the Agazio Loiero Regional Committee of California does not deny that in his region it is "all but an exception to encounter links between local administrations and organised crime." "There are places where the concentration of the Mafia is greater than in others, in which such links are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of 'ndrangheta: heroes who get a white West."
The arrests of this morning follow those of the last July, with which the Piromelli clan police were arrested.
Since the end of the last April, the municipality council of Gioia Tauro has been dissolved, but in 1991 – and also at that time due to alleged links between organised crime and local administration – local politicians of their community have been removed.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of Udc, was elected as head of the Central Committee after the election of May 2006.
He shouted when the prefecture arranged the dissolution of the municipality.
He was interested in the vice-minister Marco Minniti, who wanted to have invented everything for political and strategic reasons, but the judges explained in connection with the arrest warrant this morning that the Piromelli-Clan had even expected to apply for an amendment of the A3 project.
From a hearing in connection with the investigations into the Dal Torrione case, the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur, who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli, has been shown to be the same as the interests of this clan."
When energy comes out of the waves, the big ones suddenly run on
It is a non-perishing source of money that covers over 70% of the planet's surface and only now seems to understand the world's large energy companies.
Waves, currents and currents are the new renewable energy sources that all are now looking at, and also looking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of winning energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and investigated for 70 years; these studies have not been significantly intensified since the first earthquake.
When the price of oil in 1980 broke down the idea of marine energy, but now the environmental organizations and the increased oil price are pushing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the global energy needs could be met by the energy generated by the oceans.
This is similar to the double energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and currents are still coming.
Giants on the attack.
The first company, which now operates on marine energy, is Enersis, which signed in 2005 a contract establishing a power plant in northern Portugal.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are now more and more companies from the traditional energy sector that focus on marine energy generation.
"Chevron examines these technologies" – the speaker of a company known as the U.S. Giant in the Wall Street Journal – and hesitates to cooperate with us."
This is about getting permission from the American Energy Commission, which is needed to start a project on the coast of Alaska.
This is a non-estimating sign, e.g. when you think that oil is still being promoted by the United States in Alaska and President Bush recently set up plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new sector; the details are not known, but observers say of an increasing interest.
Even better technologies.
Experts speak of a technology still in progress, which is not last, as the last doubts of environmental protection have not yet been clarified.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of a rather small dimension and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy to a large extent, technologies with far greater environmental impact are needed.
There are various possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of connected bojen.
The swelling of the waves that move the bojens up and down is transformed into hydraulic pressure within the swimmers over flasks and cylinders.
This one drives a turbine, which then drives a generator.
The current is sent to the coast via underwater pipelines.
So far, there are four planned facilities of this kind, which are only waiting for the State's approval, and some of the energy generated could also be used for military institutions.
Verdant Power is already producing energy for a shopping house and a parking lot using underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the ages drive the turbines that feed the generator through the rotating motion.
According to Verdant, a long chain of potential customers is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
Only the waves, then the seasons.
According to the Institute for Electricity Recovery, a particular interest is currently worth the potential that lies in the times.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the times are better predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and also waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is precisely what the federal states, such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million have already been planned for 2009.
