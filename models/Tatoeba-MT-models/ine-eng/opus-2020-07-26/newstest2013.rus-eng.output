Republican strategy against the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republic justified their policy on the need to combat counterfeiting in the elections.
However, in the centre of Brennan, they consider the latest myth, claiming that the cases of counterfeiting in the United States elections are less rare than those of a mill.
In addition, only 300 cases of electoral falsifications in the United States in ten years have been reported by the lawmakers.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on the appearance of voters.
In this sense, such actions are partly discredited by the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most governments have since 2009 adopted laws that complicate the registration or voting process.
This event was new in November 2010, following the November 2010 elections, which brought 675 new seats to the Republicans in 26 states.
As a result, only 180 drafts of voting rights in 41 states were adopted for one year.
New laws on elections require the elector to provide a certificate of identity with a photograph and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of pre-trial voting, cancel the voter ' s registration on the day of election and withdraw the right to vote from citizens with jurisdiction.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state had committed voters to certifying the identity of the photograph.
India became the first state to impose such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indian law in 2008.
The Republican authorities have been able to disseminate this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills that oblige voters to provide identity certificates with a photograph in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as a medical insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, that is, 21 million people who have reached the age of voting, do not have the identity of the photo issued by the government body of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
However, the value of obtaining the required identity certificate often exceeds a hundred dollars.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of those who earn less than $35,000, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required identity certificate with the photograph.
But that's not all.
Students - voters who are considered to be voting for candidates from Democrats, in several states, are not allowed to use the identity of the photograph issued by their educational institution.
The same states therefore allow members of the fishing and fishing clubs who vote mainly for the Republic to use the certificates issued by these clubs to vote.
By 2004, no State had required proof of American citizenship to vote.
For the first time, such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the vote of the people from Latin America.
Two thirds of Latin American voters are expected to vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, the Republican legislators introduced in 2011 laws that abolished voter registration on the day of the vote in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those wishing to register.
This restriction has not been without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the electoral registration campaign helped to list about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009 have resulted in a 17 per cent decline in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of the preliminary vote.
Thus, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33 per cent of voters voting in advance were African Americans, although the latter accounted for only 13 per cent of the total number of state voters.
The same thing happened with Latin Americans.
By representing only 11 per cent of the voters, they represented 24 per cent of the citizens who voted in advance.
Unlike the whites who formed 76 per cent of the voters, only 46 per cent of the voters voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters are actively opposed to the adoption of laws limiting the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were welcomed by the Democrat Governors.
The most controversial legislation was suspended with the intervention of the United States Attorney General.
This has led to a partial limitation of the negative effects.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the identification of the person with the photograph.
However, the new rules that have come into effect will, of course, make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Critics from Democrats condemn the preeminence of the laws that have been adopted, with a clear focus on influencing the outcome of the 2012 elections in key states.
The report of the Brennan Centre since 2011 shows that the States that have adopted these laws are 171 out of 270 votes required by the electorate to win the presidential election.
It is too early to assert with confidence that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the appearance of voters.
In this sense, such actions are partly discredited by the system of American democracy.
Screening the cancer of the present-day iron: running test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes produces erroneous, false, and sometimes false results that lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctantly dissident, have even more suspicion.
Is the test going on or not?
We asked the opinion of two experts.
Studies in the United States have seen numerous cases of infection among the study groups, and therefore it is difficult to interpret and make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found a different level of mortality among patients who had been screened and those who had not.
This study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the likelihood of metastases was 30-40 per cent higher than those who had not been screened.
Therefore, I would recommend that a test be carried out from 50 years of age or 40 if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin are also at increased risk.
A key point is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and powerful.
The patient needs to explain the risk of his or her cancer by offering possible options without compulsory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a long-term risk to life, and by choosing, in these cases, for the benefit of active monitoring of the disease.
To this day, many men with cancer will not undergo treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to life.
We will offer them active surveillance, and if the disease starts to progress, we will start treatment.
More and more, we accurately define the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo a treatment course.
I would therefore recommend that the test be carried out anyway.
But it is also important to consult your doctor to determine whether this test is necessary or not.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Mowember has created an instrument to assess all for and against the passing of the PSA test.

Preventing Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in scientific research, respect for a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people were well fed and moved enough, 30% of cancer could be prevented.
"If no one smoked anymore, this figure would increase to at least 50%," stressed Andre Bolie, the press secretary of the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cancer cases are caused by inheritance.
Several types of cancer remain unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, smoking remains a priority, despite a reduction in the number of smokers.
Smoking is related to 85% of cases of mild cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It brings enormous harm to people’s health.
"Even today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said Andre Bolie, press secretary.
The encouraging fact is that after 10 years of quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Wes
According to the CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to the occurrence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, fat and direct oxygen, food, iron and mattresses.
"Research shows that regular physical activity protects against the cancer of the stomach throughout life," they add to the Association.
Question
The Association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too many cases, it increases the risk of the cancer of the stomach.
The use of sausages should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by pressing, drying or dressing may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can harm the cells of the body and lead to cancer development," the Association explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have studied the impact of vitamin supplements on cancer development.
But at this point, the results of these studies cannot be called unanimous.
According to the SCC, vitamin E studies produce contradictory results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other led to the opposite outcome.
The impact on the development of vitamin D cancer is also not fully clear.
However, Mr. Bolio stressed the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with a doctor.
"Adequate analysis doesn't lead to cancer."
Bozon Higgs in detail
Last summer's report that scientists may have been able to detect the Higgs boson caused the present aviation - and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all particles in the universe, not much.
In addition, it is the last particle that has been predicted in the Standard Model - our best, or, in any case, the "minimum" description of nature and the behavior of matter - but which has not previously been able to find an experienced way.
But physics isn't sure until the end that this is about Higgs.
We know, without a doubt, that we are dealing with a really new particle, and that it is very fond of the Higgs boson, which is predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, although some data is not yet available for full certainty.
Let's imagine, however, what this is about, Higgs, because the chances of making mistakes seem minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is a law in this world that is completely inevitable, stating that two things cannot happen in the same place at the same time.
There's no way to turn this rule around, not even try too hard, or you'll hurt yourself.
But although the physics of the elementary particles is quite strange, it also appears that there is a law of a similar nature: the principle of the exception of Paul, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum" state, it is the "state" in general terms in some of their characteristics.
On this basis, physics divides particles into two categories.
In one corner, we are well-informed citizens called farms, who are reasonably subject to Pauli's principle.
In the other, the bozones, the ugly band of anarchists who have no respect for anything, at least to that principle, mean that they can be at the same place at the same time.
According to the site (parts, totally unusual) of the Parole Adventure Laboratory Berkeley, these bozones are divided, in turn, into two groups: mezones that we are not talking about, and "power particles", through which the main forces of nature are distributed and which some form of the Higgs bozone.
These very bozones should be emphasized, not all such exotic substances, as could be thought of.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it's because of one incredibly banal boson: photon, or "part of light", which is the "currier" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "infringes" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a stone thrown into the dust.
The “infringement” is derived from an electromagnetic wave (world, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a photon - and therefore one of the bosons “power transferors”.
More stable fields
The same is true of the Higgs boson, with only the difference that in order for this boson to appear, another field, the Higgs field, must be broken.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable in the electromagnetic field; in order to stimulate it, it has to be achieved very and very high energy, as if it were a frozen stream, whose surface could only collapse a very large stone.
That's why we need a huge particle accelerator, like the one operating in CERN, the Big Adrian Collaire, which is a 27-km-diameter ring, to achieve such enormous energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, while others do not. For example, a paper sheet will never be kept on the refrigerator itself.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (such as photon, etc.) do not have it.
So, what can we do about all this research, Mrs. Flamondon?
They are used in science to verify the integrity of the Standard Model (SM), which also enables physics to distinguish between observation results and the projections of the PM.
In addition, some of them are eager to find such a distinction, that is, a minor disagreement can open the door for "new physics" and shut down some of the Model holes.
The last thing to say is that there are still significant shortcomings without providing any explanation for gravity (o!) or for dark matter that forms about 80% of the universe (o-o!).
But until the CERN found such differences.
Consequences
The benefits of these studies for the daily life of a medium-statistician would be more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that it is not.
See: In the early 1960s, laser pioneers in Bella's laboratories couldn't even imagine what a revolution would bring about their work.
They predicted their applications in science, but no more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in Bell's Laboratories, where a laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (formerly pulsed) in 1962, said that the laser was initially considered a "laboratory gadget".
Imagine...
In addition, the annex can be found for a study accompanying instrument.
For example, the same Williard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 during his optical research.
This sensor, although not yet its original purpose, now serves as a "eye" for all digital cameras of the world and earned the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Greater Adrian Collaire will necessarily change our lives, but it just shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative assistance is the best way to die...
The Commission recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life in Quebec for worthy death.
The debate must be resumed soon and the bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this crucial area.
Long tried to look closer.
Only a few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived in his apartment in Monterey.
The cancer of the prostate that destroyed him from the inside gave him a two-year delay.
"I was five years old, I lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed at the reception of Victor Gadbua's palliative care in Belloy, where he arrived early.
"But it's always a shock, it's impossible to prepare for it," he says.
The disease is doing its job: an incredible weakness that does not allow itself to walk into the toilet and even to eat on its own.
Sitting at the table on which an appetizer is held, he gives up and agrees to help him eat.
He dares, even dares to smile, talks to strangers who work around him, bring him medicine, take him to the bathroom.
The courage before the usual death.
"My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhoea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for the disease.
"We're taught during life that a man should wash his feet," says Pierre Broder, psychologist at Victor Gadbua's reception.
Regress to the status of the child, for some unbearable humiliation.
"Everything depends on man's ability" to settle down, he argues.
As many people in palliative care believe that important events are taking place in the worst part of this decline.
Patients entering the Palliative Hospital, Victor Gadbua, are all sick with cancer.
Forecasts lead to a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, a medical team and a nurse do not provide any more assistance called "medical".
Mrs. A., 89 years old, is the most afraid of dying "in the consciousness of the ghost."
But that's why the disease made me know my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't want anything more in life," she says before she allows her to put on a breathing mask.
She is still awaiting her son's last visit from Italy in the coming days.
In the reception of Victor Gadbua, a group of volunteers provide body care and food assistance.
This is a palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, for every 11,700 inhabitants, there is one place in Palliative Assistance Institutions.
That's very little, given that sooner or later we're all gonna die.
Here life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the foster doctors.
Be comfortable physically, emotionally, or mentally.
The dying one agrees to provide oral flakings from a brandy or pepsy, even though he will ask.
We don't have to control the sugar level anymore.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought Mr. H. a beer that died tonight.
In the morning, his son got this beer in his leg and died.
"We help people as well as patients," says Natalie Savar, director of care for the sick.
Victor Gadbu's reception doesn't look like the previous day.
A number of 93-year-olds who enjoy their last meeting with their family in the yard, sitting on their pillows during the toast in his honor, tragically die a young man 36 years old surrounded by parents, wife and two little children and tried everything to survive.
"In the last half of the year, between three and five cats have always been treated with cancer at the age of 45," said Dr. Christian Martel anxiously.
53 per cent of patients admitted to Victor Gadbua's shelter are from home and 47 per cent from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is estimated that 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care provided to alleviate the suffering of patients entering the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in the hospital or in the hospital.
And some institutions, such as Victor Gadbua and the Palliative Care Society at the House of the Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in care for cancer patients.
It is this great breakthrough in Quebec's health system that causes many palliative care physicians to fear the adoption of a law that legalizes euthanasia and aid in suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by palliative care lights, Dr. Balforam Mountain and Dr. Bernard Llapont, has been circulating and demonstrating their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, the health system in Quebec is not effective enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before a transition to euthanasia is permitted.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency ward in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to relieve them.
I'm afraid patients want to die just because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists have tried to save patients until the last day, despite pessimistic predictions.
The hopes for the survival of Ellen Richard were already minimal when she had stopped the ingenious chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I was stopping the fight, she told me.
At that, she told me that my days were supposed to be!
There's no universal care.
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who ask for death are grateful for their failure to comply with their request after the palliative care team eases their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely effective in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, the director of Palliative Care in the Palliative Care Society of the Greater Montreal House, patients are not susceptible to recovery in 8 per cent of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sessions, where the patient sleeps until his death, from time to time, or at all times.
We cannot assume that we do not know about these sufferings.
More and more sick people who are unable to relieve pain will be able to have access to the palliative session.
The sick who suffer from the pain will always say the same word, "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want to be euthanasia," that means "I want to be easier for me."
The creation of this report was made possible by the Journalist Grant from the Institute of Health Studies in Canada.
Large-scale scans with real estate in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, political party collectors and Italian mafia specialists tell of what they know about the enormous "system" that is driving the construction industry, public servants, politicians, trade union officials and mafia.
Industry, which was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's a pleasure to see this system explode after all the funds have been put in place, Jack Dusheno, the deputy and former chief of the Montreal police."
It was the result of the scandal in 2011 as a result of the investigation of official crimes related to road construction contracts in Quebec, which the Prime Minister of the time of the Liberals, Jean Share, agreed very reluctantly.
The report of Dušeno established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
“From the start of the investigation in 2010, he stressed that only one Ministry of Transport would retain a billion dollars in contracts”, if some had held back their instincts from taking part.
The Sharbonno Commission “has already moved two mayors”, he adds, hoping that it will be able to “close up the schemes of individual individuals”.
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The case was linked to the Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011, which included a large state of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the staff of the Special Unit Molot, which, after 2009, had imposed Montreal ' s "star cartel ", had stopped the value of the contracts.
During the past few weeks, a series of searches have been carried out, and some municipal officials, in particular Frank Zampino and Richard Markotte, mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
In turn, Jill Vayangur, recently retired from the position of Mayor Laval, third in the size of the province of Quebec.
It is suspected of multiple receipts when placing public orders.
In addition, the formal indictment was filed by several engineers on the way to Montreal and the construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Akurso and Lino Zambito.
The last was the bomb, following an investigation into the "system" of receiving public contracts.
For several years, Zambito had given up 3% of the contract value in Montreal to a Mafia mediator who, in turn, had transferred the money to Mayor Gerald Tramble's "United Montreal".
In the 2000s, Zambito slumped his money right and left, listing more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) for the various provincial parties, mostly liberals then in power.
He also recognized that he had illegally collected funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister of the Liberal Party of Natalie Normando.
Contingents in which value has been exceeded
The "system" of corruption in Montreal worked indiscriminately.
Zil Suurprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail before the commission: in ten years he received from construction companies gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and takeovers for a total of $736,000 in exchange for sewerage contracts with higher cost.
Other road construction officials recognized that they had received 30-40 per cent of the bill with false supplements.
Then an organizer from the mayor's party, Martin Dumon, accused Mr. Tramble of deliberately closing his eyes on the existence of a parallel budget filled with dirty money.
After these revelations, Mr. Tramble retired early in November, loading Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulu was one of the first MPs in Montreal to be alarmed.
The mayor of the River-de-Preri district in the east of the island, has been opposed to the sale of a municipal site purchased for $5 million and resold for... 1.6 million for construction booms.
70 per cent of dirty money in pre-election campaigns
She said that in the investigation, which would eventually be launched, she would be “twisted behind a thread to understand the functioning of a system that was squeezing with ants to stop the gangrene and to identify the perpetrators”.
This process is described as “sick but positive”.
We are in the process of clearing the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigation team and observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
How we get home.
Regularly.
Jacques Dusheno notes that “the perpetrators have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars”, but he is particularly concerned about the role of “election officials who know about the scheme” but who are not involved in the crafts.
Given that the share of dirty money in funding the election campaign in Quebec is 70 per cent, he jokes, "I was told that it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit up to 100 dollars of party donations, but it does not say that this will change the situation: "Until we strictly limit the election costs, there will be dirty money in politics."
It requires full restructuring of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: “We can’t go down below; we can build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legitimacy, if we are courageous.”
If this story leaves a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Dusheno calls on those who laugh to look into their own courtyard...
"PES--not FK Barcelona!"
During this season, you have reached an unusual range in the PSC.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual awareness, but may also be by a new measurement of GSPs.
Big games have come.
I grow up with them every day.
Technical personnel have also contributed a lot.
These factors make me raise my game level every day.
And during the match, it's simple.
It's all happening very quickly in football.
But I don't burn.
From the very beginning at the pre-training centre of NIF in Clerfonten and until my arrival in St. Etienne, I have always been moving forward.
So you benefit from the competition established by Carlo Ancheloti...
Filling this summer is not in the news to play a very high-level match.
They also know that each training is very important.
This leads to such a game as I want to be at the level and to be taught as much as possible.
Also, Carlo Anchelotti is supporting my position.
He's been helped by alternates like Claude McKelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancheloty is the owner of the situation?
Of course.
Ancholytti respects all technical personnel.
He is not equal today in the First League and he is among the best trainers in Europe.
He had extensive experience, and he won many high-class titles.
He worked with big players.
I think he'll bring new Paris titles.
I had a very encouraging conversation with him in January.
Then I left a series of traumas.
The trust he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In the First League, Lion took the lead in us.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the League of Champions: we have effectively qualified in one eighth final.
What's the goal of the club in this tournament?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
It can be anything from now on.
We can say our word to the person with very good European teams.
We first want to finish the first in our group, in front of Porto, to be able to take a response match in one eighth final.
Can the PSC become the first-class European club in the short term?
He's got a budget for that.
In order to become a major European club, it is necessary for Paris to win titles and to secure positions in the long term.
It's not like that today.
The GSP has financial resources to make this project real.
Not taking the title in the First League, like last season, would be a big mistake?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really want to get this championship title.
Last season, we were close.
In May, we were disappointed because we had everything to come to the finish line first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points are called champions.
But the other team, Monpeille, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Despite the fact that the title struggle has taken on strong teams such as Marcel, Leon and Bordo, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media is waiting too much for the PSG?
It's normal for us to expect a lot, given how many games we've had and how many games we have.
We're all ready for that.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 against Trua at home, and we still find something to criticize, of course, it's a little frustrating.
We are asking the question of what people are primarily looking for.
We'll never be able to win every weekend with a 4-0.
We're not the Barcelona FC!
We're trying to implement the game project.
The command is formed in time.
We have proved in the Champions League that we can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, which no longer has two seasons to go to one eighth final, even though they have also spent a lot of money!
Taking into account the amounts invested, we represented you at 15 points ahead of the winter break.
That would be a disregard for our opponents and for the French championship.
Lion and Marcel, who were not high in the past season, were "stirred" by these new GSPs.
This shows how attractive the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say to ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
The PSG seems to be entirely dependent on the triumphs of the Gold Abrahamimovic.
Well, what if they say there's some kind of gold dependency?
This just means that Ibrahimic is very successful and that he's killing a lot of heads.
He's come for it and he proves he's the star of the First League.
Where he was playing, he showed that he was a great player and a world-wide star.
In the group we respect him as a man and as a player.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he did is really exclusive.
It also stimulates others to improve their game.
Her Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro-2012 with the collection of France?
It's a disappointment.
I wanted to be a part of this Euro.
Regrettably, my trauma prevented me from wasting some time in the game.
I've seen a lot of things there, and I'm out of here stronger.
Today I'm going to be able to play good cheerleaders.
That's what I've hoped for since I was baptized in the Blues.
We learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now we have to be exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Desham in the head of the Blues?
They're good for him.
He's got a good position in the lead team at the world championship.
He's a strict coach, he's close to the players and inspires victory.
How was Lauren Blanc.
But I don't want to compare.
Blan reached his goal, he qualified us in Euro.
I hope Didie Dasham will bring the Blues to Brazil.
The good one (1-1) that was fired in Spain on 16 October is a fundamental match?
This match has given us faith in itself.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that, the shock in Spain, my career was not like that.
Pay and sell without bank help - with Bitcoin
The full contrast between the current currency exchange based on central banks, the transactions recorded between the receiving parties and the commissions for their processing.
In addition, as is often the case with these technologies, it is clear that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (psedonym), is also a virtual currency (but converted into dollars, euro ...) and a protected protocol for the exchange of BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files between participants of the same level.
Some 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousand sites take the beatings to make donations or as a means of payment.
The Battle Course, reaching a maximum of 30 dollars (EUR 23) in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning to about 10 dollars today (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing is special compared to the world ' s real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in this system in its report on the virtual currency published in October.
It describes the beaticon as “the most successful virtual currency”, “competition with the dollar or the euro” and “like normal currencies”.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as “credit” used to promote video games that are working in the game or that can be bought (and sometimes exchange).
The Facebook social network has also developed such a system.
But the exchange operations always control and process a central body.
In Bitcon, all networks are also accountants, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses, like e-mail.
Only for each new payment can the user choose another address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information relating to this transaction is signed by electronic means using a double key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is possible to verify that the battles used in the transaction actually exist in the public account book distributed throughout the network.
A key step is the registration of a new transaction in this book.
It passes through a mathematical task sent to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, has the privilege of adding this new line.
This is a phase of file manipulation, that is to convert a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "take" a new transaction and add a number before "hashing" it all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (very zero at the beginning).
Once this number has been found, other angles are easy to verify that it is correct.
The transaction is thus indirectly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the sake of deception, the user wanted to pay twice the same money, only one of the two transactions would be confirmed by the network, and the other would remain unconfirmed as they had different electronic signatures.
A computer that solves the problem gets 50 beats.
In order to avoid inflation, the prize will be divided regularly by half by the end of 2012.
So the number of battles is limited by 21 million, but they are divided into one million, leaving another reserve...
The complexity of the task is also growing with increased computing power.
The life of the network has already been affected by flooding and falling.
The Bitcoin service sites were attacked and the battles were stolen from the reserves.
"The defect used does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Nouaza, who recently started Paymium, a real money-paying company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But money also has a lack of it.
Major players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept such donations.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, are allowed to do so.
Recently Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Wakeman Institute in Israel analyzed the book and found that almost 80 per cent of the battles were missing.
Giant sales were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," said Jon Holmkvist, who works in Coinabul, who is involved in the conversion of the bets into gold.
Pierre Nuaza, another author of this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in this money) or a wireless payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check transactions, so it goes cheap.
The owner better controls his personal data and may thus be anonymous.
The system is simple for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
Just provide an address that can be “photographed and identified” by the phone, explains Pierre Nuaza, confirming that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general trend towards a more horizontal revision of hierarchical systems.
"Before Bitcoin is approved, it will take some time, but 2013 may become a turning point," he predicts.
In its report, the ECB intends, in fact, to review the various risks considered to be high today in the case of the success of the system.
We're out of Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capis and Surobi).
NATO and Americans are to follow them at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, not just hope for us.
We've been affected mainly by the Afghan Crescents that we saw as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 soldiers killed, and wounded and killed.
The Taliban is made up of foreign extremists, ex-combatants hiding in Pakistan, but also often of the Cretans who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case with the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, and even join the jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbek, Tajiki.
They are patient, sometimes helping the local rebels, but they will no longer be as gentle as the West.
The departure of French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the heights of trees planted by the trees through French credits, went well.
The convoys of trucks and armoured helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no Taliban attacks in Kabul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances changed from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of fighting between different groups.
They were then taken under the control of the country as their kind of liberation, return to security.
The Afghan women paid for the darkness of these Cretans, in which Al-Qaida exceeded them, but their situation has not improved in our days.
The former Mojahedes, the Afghan Government and the present Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in subjection.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become delinquents occupying public land to resell them to return to the returnees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, using huge US subcontracts.
They are discredited; most of them, in fact, have not even fought.
People like me in the rural area want a government that would be free of thieves.
Many young people want to leave as those who have earned American generosity go: the flow of capital is significant.
Young people have stopped the war and its ideology.
They lived in a modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated its advantages.
About 65 per cent of the population is under the age of 25 and there are now 5 million inhabitants in Kabul, one fifth of the population.
State schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people who will not want to return to the darkness of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
All, including armed warriors, love mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world and that look everywhere.
There's an army right now.
Will the authorities who will command it be considered legitimate?
The old commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle have already taken steps to restore provincial women who would not be subject to the central authority.
Afghanistan, with strong local differences, must be decentralized to a certain extent, in the form of Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential authority, eliminating the Prime Minister's post that had existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, starting in the 1950s, and even before, depends on foreign aid.
The industry has not been installed on foot, nor has any platinum operated, nor has any irrigation system been repaired.
All are imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
A private initiative will be given priority.
In a country destroyed by the Thirty Years of War, State control of infrastructure would be necessary.
They heard that Afghanistan had enormous mineral resources.
This only reinforced the feeling that Western countries were present only to take possession of them.
No energy for the processing of iron or copper on the spot, no means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no profitable mining.
The Chinese have almost left the Mess Aynak residence, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers of the province.
It is also necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations in one fine day.
The release of the French military units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the maintenance of traditional assistance: for girls, for boys, the French language faculty at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, and the support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to “conquer the heart and mind” and to achieve the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the service of “military-citizen activities” at the Ministry of Defence (Chimic), which was abolished in 2012, along with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These efforts, with the intensive involvement of local labour, have been able to help keep up with the rise: irrigation, wells, drinking water, restoration of forests, fruit trees, soil protection and increased farmland.
What do we keep in mind when we spend two billion euros on military spending?
A much smaller budget would help improve the living conditions of the local population, which are very severe in these valleys, often more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural works from local communities in the province of Capis.
In order to get rid of the uprisings led by foreign groups, which the farmers wanted, as they told me, they needed little non-military support that would be well controlled and directly addressed.
Heavy births of the Constitution of Egypt
This is the new risk-taking step of President Muhammad Morris.
While Egypt was more divided than ever on the issue of a constitutional declaration, which temporarily gave it extraordinary powers, it decided to play a va-bank.
After all, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text for the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of State provided the Assembly with two additional months to complete the work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been relying on a preliminary text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only strengthened the division of the country.
In the view of his opponents, the President insists on his "autocratic bridge", continuing "to violate this word" and "to support the right".
His followers were assured that this was a way to end the institutional and political crisis by speeding up the transition process.
The referendum should be held within fifteen days.
It is a very short time for the Brothers to give up their intention to explain to the Egyptians the text, article after article.
For the President, this is also a way to restore social and democratic legitimacy, while dissatisfaction is taking place throughout the country.
Muhammad Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians voted positively, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
The more the call for an accelerated vote comes from the ultimate of the Egyptian people: " Either you vote for my text, or I leave the extraordinary powers," which are supposed to end after the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamic, voted yesterday for the text.
Most Liberals have not responded to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they knocked on the door, feeling unable to bring their opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the required quorum, 11 people, reserve participants, were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.
The commentators, in fact, have made it difficult for the fact that one of the few differences of day occurred around... time for prayer, since some members of the Committee felt that the time of the Constituent Assembly was wrong.
The text by which the vote was taken yesterday consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, article 2 has finally remained an identical article of the 1971 Constitution, which states that “the principles of the Sharia are a fundamental source of law”.
The Salafiist parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law is a fundamental requirement, hoped to replace the “principles” with “laws”, which would enable them to be more rigorously applied.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is evidence of their good will and respect for others of Egyptian society.
"Licemerie" is the responsibility of the liberals who only see a pirate in it.
Because they believe that Islamization of the Constitution is being done through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with Shariat laws.
According to Egypt's expert Sophie Memory, this is alarming, i.e. "people who are meant to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."
We can observe the birth of theocracy."
Many liberals are also encouraged by the fact that the next rector of this university seems to be somewhere less moderate than the present one.
"There is currently no specific religious interference.
With this constitution, we remain under civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not interested, but people with university education, some have been trained in the French system," says Alexis Bloe, who prepares a dissertation on Egypt's constitutional transition.
But he recognizes that “the scope of article 220 may vary as the terms used therein are borrowed from religious lexicons.
This refers, in particular, to the "fifh" [Islamic jurisprudence, e.g. order.].
And in the future, there may be a question of how many civil judges are competent to make decisions about this."
In addition to its religious dimension, the text adopted yesterday was criticized, as it gave wide authority to the President of the Republic.
Muslim brothers claim that they have been significantly reduced compared to those in the old regime.
Another controversial moment: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, consideration of the defence budget will be held, not in Parliament, but in the National Defence Council.
It will also not be prohibited to judge civilians in military courts, despite requests from human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text they considered to be harmful to freedom.
The responsibility for blasphemy is maintained, and the insult is now prohibited, which may have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
Furthermore, none of the articles spoke of the protection of women, Heba Moraef, from Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that had not appeared in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to speak yesterday evening on TV, the demonstrations were scheduled for the second half of the day.
The Heads of State, in turn, will leave the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, Pop Earth and the Sea of Dessola
The Promised Land unites itself with the grandeur of Bible truth, modern comfort, and natural beauty.
The AIF has identified five of the most important reasons to be found in Israel.
Worshiping the Holy Places
The Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized, is to be found.
It is believed that all those who enter this "purchase" will reap God’s favor.
And Galilee was a place of healing: in the same way were they converted into wine, and into wine, and into strong drink, and into strong drink.
Then Jesus appeared before the disciples and after the resurrection of the dead.
But the most sacred place in Jerusalem.
Those who believe here follow the Path of Grief or the Crossway of Jesus (in Latin - Via Doloroz).
It begins in the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria, where there was justice, and on the streets of the Old Town, it leads to the Temple of the Lord on Mount Golgotha - a place of Rusperity, the Stone of the Anointed, and a place of Jesus' burial.
Here, then, is the symbolic Christian pope of the earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be raised up in a place where, according to the Christian legend, a tree from which the cross was made for Jesus ’ burial grew.
There is also the most holy place in Jerusalem for the Jews - St. Plač, a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, people of different denominations leave notes with wishes that are then fulfilled.
Perform a vertical journey
The ruins of Massada's fortress remained secret from the enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are located on hanging rocks in the mountains at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And only those who are involved in alpineism can come to them.
The rest of this historic peak is delivered on the canath.
In the north of the country, between 1600 and 2040 m is the famous mountain resort Hermon, where in winter months there is a huge wave of tourists.
He's on a bus shuttle from the foothills.
The total length of mountain trails is 45 km.
According to the ancient tradition, at the top of the mountain, the gods of the language apparently lived.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in the country.
You're not going to all of us for one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth visiting.
Among them are the Moses of Israel, located near Knesset (parliament).
It contains the oldest Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls found in the caves of the Jewish Desert, and some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It's worth a visit to the Museum of Arts in Tel Aviv.
The exhibition presents a wide range of impressionists and expressionists, Mone, Pissarro, Renoara, Sezanna, Sisley, Matissa, Modiliani, Shagala, Picasso.
Akko can be found at the Al Basha Museum, representing several halls of ancient Turkish baths with a crowd of visitors and bankers at that time.
In Caesarea, you must go to the unique Rally Museum, where you can love the sculptures of Dali and Roden.
There are no excursion guides and souvenir boxes.
Access is free, and donations are not accepted categorically.
The fifth - the Holocaust Museum or the Jad-Washm in Tel Aviv - is one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section, the child memorial, is built in memory of 1.5 million children who have been destroyed in child lockers and gas chambers.
You go into it, and you're in absolute darkness.
The stars are dying.
And the names of the children of Jews and the names of the countries where they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Heal yourself.
The three major Israeli resorts are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each has swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanariums.
Interestingly, even in the winter months, the Red Sea is bathed because the water temperature is not below 21 degrees Fahrenheit and the air is warmed to 23 degrees Fahrenheit.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and it is bathed for a year.
This is the most unusual sea in the world at the lowest point of the planet, 417 metres below sea level.
It's a salty water that's easy to keep in the blue even if it's not even able to swim.
Landscapes around are not really beautiful.
It is here to undergo treatment with salt water, rape, and fungi, and to treat health in dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes mellitus, to bring the nerves down.
Touching the Secrets of the Ancient Age
They are kept by the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffo on the Mediterranean coast.
It was followed by the famous route of the Sea, which connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, this is where Noah built his ark, and Persia saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists are very fond of taking advantage of the narrow alleys called Zodiac signs.
They're saying if you get to the walls on the "your" sign, Fortuna's gonna be kind.
Young women coming from all over Israel and even from other countries can meet in Jaffo.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can enjoy the Roman theater, the fortress of the Crusaders.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the principal city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The heavily refurbished theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
A tourist on the note
By sending to Israel, don't worry about your imperfect English: about 30 per cent of the population know Russian.
The money to travel is better not in the euro, but in dollars that are easy to exchange on shekels (now $1 - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mainly bus, but in Jerusalem there is a speed tram, and in Haife is the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower City to the Upper.
In fact, it's a subterranean funicular.
A tour of all types of urban transport is worth 6 bicycles, which can be driven over 1.5 hours.
In Israel, the Nate was observed on the Sabbath by Jewish tradition.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops, public transport are stopped.
And on Sundays, Sundays, Sundays, Sundays, Sundays, Sundays, Sundays, Sundays, Sundays, Sundays, Sundays, Sundays, Sundays, Sundays, Sundays, Sundays, Sundays, Sundays, Sundays, Sundays, Sundays, Sunday
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without garlic, and a meal in which milk is mixed with meat.
It offers a wide selection of beranches and beef, soups and desserts prepared on coconut milk, traditional Jewish pasta humus, various sauces, malt nuts, fruit and vegetables.
There are no sailing dogs on the streets of the Israeli cities.
That's why there's a lot of fattened balls that just "play on their own."
In the evening, they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
The ants love human places and do not give up shelters.
The rental of the car, depending on the brand, ranges from $37 per day (Hyundai Gettz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
In addition to insurance, $15 a day.
And the bike's going to go to 15 checkpoints a day.
The museum tickets are on average 30 shekels.
Number in Language
In 2012, Israel visited more than three million tourists worldwide.
Most of the time, citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came to travel and rest.
There were 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists on Earth from January to October 2012, which increased by 51 per cent by 2010 until the visa was cancelled on 9 February 2011.
"Great and possible" will lead to Moscow: migrants are digging money into the language
While MPs and human rights defenders argue that the law on compulsory language testing has already been introduced in the country by counterfeiting certificates.
Every year in Moscow, Petersburg and other Russian cities, 13 million gastropods arrive.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkey.
Their only goal is to earn money to support the family.
As of 1 December, the law entered into force that each migrant worker would be required to submit an examination for knowledge of the Russian language.
While this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the field of services, housing, housing and retail trade.
In time, however, the FMS promises, tests will become mandatory for all arrivals.
Then, not only the language but also the Russian history and the basics of legislation will have to be given.
The knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed both for receipt and for extension of the permit to work.
The exemption applies only to nationals of countries where the Russian language is a State.
The law does not apply to persons who have been successful in obtaining certificates and diplomas on education until the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, objectivity and protection of rights
The network of examinations will work under the auspices of the Russian-language Institute of Puškina, the University of Peoples' Friendship, the IGC, the SPC and other Russian branches.
Migration tests will be available in all cities; more than 160 such centres have already been opened in Russia.
The testing initiative was supported by the Members of the House and the FMS.
And here are human rights defenders, before the law came into force, many times they were able to ask the press a question: what is it, actually?
What will change the obligation to know the language for Russians and for the arrivals themselves?
First of all, representatives of the Migration Service are responsible for reducing the number of people suffering from “hard slavery”.
Many are talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explained by the head of the FMS delegation of Russia in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
Protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only the organized recruitment system will solve the problems of foreign workers by 90 per cent.
There are problems with migrants without professions, education that do not know the language without medical examination.
Without understanding of the language, - sure Sebelev, - the future migrant is doomed to encounter the infidel people who will help him to remove the "road" in a narrow narrow bar, where he and his ten likes will be covered for months without food and documents for 12-14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one in their family, and when they arrive they are deceived, they pick up their passports, they don't pay their promised wages," says the Chief of Labour Migration of Tajikistan's Tolib Sharipov.
Don't pray, the inhabitant!
However, while many citizens of the Central Asian Republic are acknowledging that not only do they know the language of the country in which they are seeking, but they are writing on their own.
Of course, it is not as bad as their fault: a few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajiki can afford even so much primary education.
For their families have nothing to eat, nor do their children need to wear, wear, or wear.
As they grow older, such children are sent to work at the very first opportunity.
It's hard if the language is bad, they'll admit it.
"You feel humiliated and worthless."
True, human rights defenders have one important point in the law.
The test will only be carried out for migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be neither examination nor subsequent official work.
In the meantime, most of the gastropods continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Good to welcome, or the foreign entrance is protected"
Many of the arrivals claim that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is in bureaucratic suggestions and all the same language difficulties.
Also, legalization is worth 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
And this is a fake registration that can be made quickly and in half a thousand.
Russian police officers know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, no warrants, no warrants.
"A hundred, two per cigarette, tea," was shared with reporters from Tajikistan's Umed Huschadamov.
"Fly, don't gather, buy a candle."
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that false documents on registration were not only available to migrants.
Several “lip” certificates for language testing have already been withdrawn by FMS staff.
The sub-papers are printed on a regular colour printer.
Of course, they did not provide new owners: each of the migrants, who hoped to facilitate the test, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is twice the value of the formal test procedure: it will be passed on to the migrant in three thousand.
The main challenge is to protect the system from corruption in the near future, so that “shorts” cannot be simply bought, collected by government representatives and human rights defenders.
As long as the authorities can promise hostmen who have failed to pass the test for the first time, the time to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian arrivals will be offered in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
MDDs do not engage in the illicit arms market
The proportion of crimes involving the use of legal weapons is extremely low
The Russian MDG proposes to strengthen the law on the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: To blow fires at the weddings when the victims were killed, and the battle, built by Moscow's lawyer Dmitri Vinogradov, resulted in seven deaths.
Police want to prohibit the wearing of traumas in public places and increase the age from 18 to 21 years of age.
The idea was supported by the head of the thought committee on security and anti-corruption of Irina Jarova and promised that amendments to the arms law would be made to the House in the near future.
Not all are happy that the Russian authorities are trying to combat the problem by "crowding the hooks".
An open letter appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various public-based shooting organizations, were required to reject “unreasonable toughness”.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, according to the Russian Bureau B-bi-si criminalist Vasilii Lesnikov.
According to the IMF statistics, 142 crimes involving firearms registered in internal affairs were committed in the six months of 2012, while 1168 thousand crimes were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the tightening of the legislation in the field of civilian weapons does not place the offender on the black market.
Now, they say, any weapon at low prices can be found in Moscow.
At the same time, the MDGs claim that they control the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The Black Arms Market is filled with several channels.
The main channels are five, as told by Colonel Viktor Baranec, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and Genstaba.
Screenshot of a site that accepts arms orders
The first is an army or military trail, that is, a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in Caucasian.
"Arms are covered by Russian officers, and the caucasians themselves," says Baranec.
The next type of "black weapons" was stolen by criminals from the forces.
Baranec explained that the police had been removed and that the law enforcement officers had been stolen directly from them.
Illicit stockpiles are sold from military warehouses.
In many military camps, explosions have often occurred.
"There are proven versions that some of the fires have been made special to cover the absence," said the former soldier.
According to Baranza, they are bringing in arms manufacturers.
"Now there are private arms factories that are not competitive on the international market and that are putting weapons out of the field on the black market, including Moscow," said the expert.
Another "black" market source is smuggling.
In particular, guns and machines come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is its production, sometimes craft, and there was a mafia that organized the flow," explains the former military.
Where did the guns come from?
The experts considered what an approximate proportion of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
In 2011, the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Design prepared a report on this.
The experts analysed the reports of the MDGs and Rosstat, the criminal literature and the open data of the weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from the army and force agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market have been found there “for the sake of officials whose work is related to weapons”, the report states.
According to the researchers, 17 per cent of weapons come from armed conflict sites, 14 per cent of weapons production takes place, and 5 per cent belong to Black Archaeology.
A salesperson in one of the arms stores who asked not to call his name is convinced that no one has ever bought a weapon found by black miners - too old.
Most of the time, he says, for a new party, salesmen are going to the war camp.
By means of a gun, a person buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
It's being written off, handed over by a sticker.
"He transports it to the city and sells 900 euros here for two stores," he says.
"True, the police are in the process of all cases, so periodically, when the crime disclosure plan is being set up, they conduct a check-up with illegal arms dealers," added the consultant.
"As in a luxury store."
The seller and buyer most often find each other through acquaintances.
I've been looking at sites, on blogs, until a friend has responded, who has proposed to come to the "God" platform, where there will be a person who will take me to the "eye" where we will trade.
I only knew the price there.
Military Observer Victor Baranec
I need a know-who's out there, a salesman, a consultant, to get it.
There are vendors in the markets, but there's also to come, provided that Ivan Ivanovic, who asked me to tell him that his daughter had a toothache.
I'm even getting a couple of castes right now through a man who's convinced.
He's just putting them on me, too, because he knows I'm not gonna give it up.
Newspapers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Victor Baranec tried to be a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he prepared an article on it.
He said the schematics haven't changed.
He was given a photo album where "everything" was possible.
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," remembers the military.
The buyer, Baranza says, doesn't offer cats in the bag - everything can be tried.
I'm a potential client, I'm not just buying, we're going with a salesman in the woods, we're putting a mouse in there.
"I'm given the opportunity to shoot, and when I'm convinced that the weapons are well, we're starting to trade," he describes the expert procedure.
Smoking shop
Internet search results in websites and groups in "Intakte", where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
There is no need for documents and personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they say in the advertising cap on the "Buy a gun or a machine."
It is where users leave their applications and ask questions.
And they're selling to minors?
"No license, of course," asked the user Ivan (orthography preserved).
"Tt.Moscow Cup" is laconically formulating the Fedorenkov request.
The Federal Security Service has now launched a huge network of underground sites that want to buy weapons of war with a shovel.
People go like hungry fish to feed, and then they get the coals in Siberia.
Military observer and former military Victor Baranec
I have heard about such schemes: normally the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes a payment through the ATM.
"In response, they send a photograph and instruction, where weapons are hidden," says Dmitri Kislov, a press secretary of the People's Organization entitled to arms.
Victor Baranec claims that if you leave the application on the site, you can remain free of weapons and be left behind.

Makeovers for $100
The purchase of illegal small arms, according to experts, could amount to $100 to $900.
According to Dmitria Kislova of the Arms Rights organization, the Macarova gun can be purchased for $100-300.
It'll take a month and a half.
It is disbursed from long-term storage facilities by the management of those medium-term storage facilities.
According to the official department's statistics, compared to January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in general in Russia decreased by 7 per cent and by 22.9 thousand, while the number of detected cases of abduction and expulsion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
In the United States, fast food and supermarkets are based
MacDonalds works through all American teenagers.
In recent days in America, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in the Walmart corporations and restaurants of popular fast-food networks, such as McDonalds, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendis and Kentucky Fried Chiken.
Until nobody has to predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth wave or will be forced into an early phase.
Actions support trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to the increase in modest wages received by several Walmart workers and the fast-food system, the aim of the protestors is to establish trade union organizations in them.
Until this sector is almost covered by trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The shares started last week, after Thanksgiving, in the so-called "Black Friday", when the American economy was disrupted by the financial sales orgy, which seized millions of residents and sometimes accompanied by bribes.
On that day, some Walmart corporate workers, with 2.2 million workers worldwide working, left their jobs and took part in the company ' s trade unions and left-wing activists, whose goods are estimated to be modest and medium-sized.
Walmart sells everyone in the light, from hens, hunters' roses and car batteries to chickens, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores average from 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-paid Walmart workers are only allowed to work.
The availability and assortment of goods made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to critics, Walmart may allow itself to sell goods in part because he pays little to his employees.
The latter also complains about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of auto-loaders or hand scanners.
Shareholders in Black Friday demanded higher wages and noted that the health insurance value provided by the corporation jumped from $30 to $100 a month.
They told a typical Walmart worker, who received $9.5 an hour, not a carnival, they said.
Researchers at the University of California in Berkeley show that if Walmart increases the average salary to $12 per hour, it will be lost to a corporation of $3.2 billion.
It's about 1.1% higher than it's spending on pay now.
If Walmart completely shifts wages to buyers' shoulders, each visit to the store will be worth only 46 cents.
In a year, they'll spend some $12,39 more than they do now.
The Walmart participants noted enough that protests took place only in nine states and did not cause any minor damage to corporations.
"Black Friday" continued in her shops from 8 o'clock dinner Thursday to midnight the next day, while Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, her cash machines carried out almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The representative of Dan Fogelman argued in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post that the workplace had left a total of "less than five" Walmart staff, and that the protest was the "special pirate trick" that organized its trade union.
"Free box!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where they were not the university of Walmart (which is not being complained about in this progressive city, and is why they are not here) and McDonalds and other cheap restaurants.
MacDonalds says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you hospitals and doesn't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaine Williams, a member of the New York Forest
At this point, the minimum wage, under federal and New York law, is $7.25 per hour.
The fast-food restaurants increase it over time, but do not know, and on average, their number of workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one earns less of them in this road town.
As there can be money in New York, it's impossible for me.
At one time, the MacDonalds have been able to hear about four American teenagers who have been working after school for them, living with their parents.
Few have seen this major source of supply or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I'm constantly going to interview McDonald's employees, who complain that they have to live for this salary and sometimes even feed children on it.
On the other hand, in the Wall Street Journal forum, a comment is hung, whose author notes that to produce children without responsibility if you don't know what you're going to feed them for.
The protesters, who started at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonalds on the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-food farmers start paying at least $15 an hour, more than doubled their current minimum wage.
They also called for the establishment of trade union organizations in the area of fast-food.
The American Act prohibits administrations from preventing and punishing trade union activists with harassment and dismissal.
On the other hand, the administration rarely facilitates their lives.
But it's difficult to get fast food from the trade union for objective reasons.
One of the main features is the unusual flow of personnel.
Non-conformity
The noise protests took place on that day and in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of a meeting at McDonald's next to the Times Square, where several local Democrats, in particular a member of the Jumein Williams forest, who said: "Macdonalds says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you hospitals and doesn't pay you for your honest work."
Other prominent New York democracies were supported by demonstrators, such as Bill De Blasio's mayor, who said that "we should join fast-food workers in a friendly way so that they would receive a fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves."
As described by the New York Times, it was the biggest action of this kind in the history of the American field of fast-food.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, but not all of them were workers of a rapid society in which tens of thousands of people were employed in New York.
It's not clear if this spark of mass movement is going to give rise.
"To deceive the brain, it's a medium."
A popular theme for modern technology lovers has recently been accepted mainly through the perception of special points.
In the summer at its annual conference, Google showed the current model and then in November it became known that Microsoft had also submitted a patent application.
However, from the interview with the leader of an interactive 3D technology group in the Cambridge laboratory, Microsoft Sharam Izadi should be able to see that the company's researchers are at a loss.
Their perspective is to manipulate virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Tell me, please, in general terms, what is your research team doing?
- We are involved in human interaction with machines, but we are trying to move the boundaries of this interaction.
While mankind in the mass was stuck in a phase of work with pixels on the flat screen, sometimes rubbing in them with their fingers.
However, we want to look at 5-10 years in advance and to anticipate a dramatic change in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect, because it's all interestingly bad governance.
- What else is ahead of us?
- Despite Kinect's physical interaction, many are still on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data) and the conclusion has not yet been much.
We're trying to change it, we're working on really three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projectives.
It is necessary to release the computer world into our physical world to make it more vulnerable.
To do so, however, we need to recognize not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more comfortable way.
And first of all, these stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voting?
Popular stuff, but aren't they reevaluating it?
He certainly cannot be called a panacea - a matter of privacy, because he does not always want to tell the environment about his actions and intentions.
Actually, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each one in his nest.
For example, to manage devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought of gestures, but not of masks, but of such expensive, short ones.
The gesture was taken not by the device camera but by the hand bracelet that fixed the movements of the bones and muscles.
As long as it's large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the manual hours.
But in general, the future for a mixed type of management, for example, a gesture+voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to transfer this paper bank to you?
You'll say and show at the same time.
- I'm usually just saying.
- Oh, it's gonna be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to make users adapt to what the machine might or may not be at the moment?
- It's not mandatory, but it's a mutual relationship.
I think that soon we will have to work mainly on developing new types of sensors that will enable us to more accurately identify human reactions.
These can be laser sensors, for example, they give the wrong depth clearance, it's very important.
- Speaking of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims to modern cameras?
Not enough permits, depths, or anything else?
In principle, the present generation is what can be removed from our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 k/s.
But it's not in the megapixels itself, it's like a matrix and a depth.
Finally, all the current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds to the work of algorithms designers.
So we need to remember not only the X and Y axis clearance, but also Z.
It's also a very important speed, the number of staff per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 k/s is extremely small, especially for gestures.
Steven Betisches from our Redmond Laboratory made a sensor for a controlled delay in processing from 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between humans and machines.
I would very much like to work with the equivalent of such a device, but it does not require relationships to increase the number of staff per second.
- And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared detector, and the other is a signal receiver.
And here's the third camera, that's actually the normal sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A potential greater number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or increase it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the camera's curve and see how this would help in the three-dimensional definition of the situation.
How much I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present her eyes to the audience.
Don't you think that the daily use of the technology of the added reality of the eye is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, all the time, I keep the smartphone in my hands, it's not very comfortable, but that's what I think: the coolest option would be the "walking" added reality when you could switch from point to point to point to the smartphone, the projection display and beyond.
Eyes are a very personal device, with their strength (private things only you see), and at the same time the weakness of the additional reality based on the points will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a minute that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from the Iron Man, but also to the mortal.
There is one problem that criticism often points to: There is no tactile response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What are your team's responses to this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that the added reality is the seventh in terms of breaks in human interaction and machines.
I think the eighth could be an addition of tactical sensations.
While one of the interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a self-imposed imagery.
She's making a great record of the shocks!
But there are technologies that are really aimed at assigning these "air-carts" to occupiers -- for example, the interference of several ultrasonic devices at a certain point where there is a finger -- gives you a feeling, but while it's very weak, it's like you've been hit by a finger.
There are also braces that affect nerve endings in your fingers, as well as a promising course.
- Did you try to deceive the brain?
To make him think he feels what he should feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried to do that yet.
There is another challenge that is still to be fought - as to force a person physically in a very limited space, to believe that he is going on an open, almost endless path - and to work on the concepts of runaway roads (not at all, such as clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge layers.
While the brain is being deceived on average, work is still very much for many years.
This is what works on the virtual reality of such attractive to the researcher - many things in an absolutely initial state.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the Peterburg Avant-garde project, which focuses on the citizens who are in advance in the cultural and artistic avant-garde.
The list already includes bright figures of the Petersburg art scene, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe by passing on universal knowledge.
The new "Rosbalt" hero is the epitome artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known as Cyril Miller, a bearded man dressed in all red that meets in the Russian Museum, in the summer now, in fashionable tusks and reindeer.
Kiril Miller's paintings always gather crowds of spectators wherever they don't show up.
Kirill Miller is one of the fundamentals of the Petersburg socio-philosophic historians, who created new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright man from the late '80s to the late '90s.
He is also a man of the city, with his appearance on the streets, who smiles at the citizens, who lifts the whole mood.
He had recently taken a charm and became a peterburg charmer, for he had created for this difficult role all his divine existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why are you still walking around the city all red, not yellow or bijous, for example?
- I've chosen a red color as a model of a kind and an image.
In this world, the red color is a compromise between an artist, an imagemaker and a society.
Although everything in society is not serious, it causes aggression and a lack of good qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to a discussion.
- And when did you realize it was supposed to be an artist?
- At the exhibition at the D.C. Nevsky, where my work was exhibited.
I knew this was my way.
Then the wave of old free informal artists passed, and the new, free-type types were untraceable to me.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gason girl who led to Puškinska-10, and there was no more waves.
I'm left in the theater, in clothes, in music, in all genres, except for words.
And all of this has been brought together in your Art Clinic... and it was important for me to feel at the center of Petersburg's culture, where all the best creative forces must be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied the territory in Puškinska-10, and there was a music and art club, a divine club, a peterburg house.
Many were born there: Nomi, Tequila-Jaz, I remember Shnura bringing in the "Echo Van Gogh" project.
Snur and his friends sang light songs under the flag, they were in a twisting trick, among them was the modern composer Igor Vdwin.
When the group played live, she became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the leader of many programmes prior to Hali-Galivian times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and we took him to a big career, and he got us basic education and education.
Gallery D 137, Griboedov Club is from Art Clinics.
That's where our workers and they've gone forever.
I'm a hero of yesterday's century when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the award was "The People of Our City".
In the name of "The Year of God" I was named, my culmination ended.
In new times, it's not easy to work on old rules, I'm a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are divided, it can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your job is a familiar way.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a clear sense of relevance and sharpness.
I'll have a program show, the Russian Museum in the clowns.
Clowns are temporary category.
I used to be social, and now it's painful and scary.
But the clowns are getting sick, and the tragedy is getting worse.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of peace through totalitarian change in order of history.
They're now wearing clothes, focusing on external mechanics, not on internal people.
Maybe he can't get his hand on the rose and spit in the rose.
And the lie will be taken away by means of a refurbishment.
We've recently seen you as a city charmer.
To whom, like me, they are.
- Can commercial art be beautiful, too?
- Commercial art must now be accurate, tactical, sweet.
It's going to deintegrate cultures.
People used to get into a room, a god loved each other, and a god loved each other.
Now it's all broken down into a micro-society, and now it's gonna be hard for everyone to enjoy.
I'm not a carpenter's paper so everybody likes it.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now every cult hero has 100 worshipers.
- And Stash Mikhailov's coming for a few thousand!
- He's coming up with the booklets. There's a sex-social field.
And 300 people will come to the cultural soil, and 10,000 won't come, and as a result less management, money, it's all gone.
I have worshipers, chiefly, who don't lie to them, who don't export the stuff.
In my youth, I wrote such paintings that one collector had them on the wall next to the Falco and the Lareon hangings.
I started with a painting that usually ends.
Now there are often misunderstandings.
They say: spiritual culture, consumption culture.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I was a man of yesterday's culture, grew up in the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, who refused money to paint paintings.
I'm for that kind of culture.
- Kirill, what's wrong with Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
That's the idea: an official of culture.
But not all of them can be cultural.
In the case of the right kings, kings may not have understood much in culture, but they understood that they needed to keep the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in Petersburg who might be experts, but they're confused, because they need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and guide them.
Now it's a taster's flower.
The same is the case with Erart, but they are distinguished by the fact that they say honestly that we do not take all modern art, there are artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's the matter with you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not a cultural capital, much more culture in Moscow, there is soil.
And on our rocks, it's hard to grow.
We need cultural soil, and we have writers now more than readers, that's wrong.
There are a lot of interesting people in Europe who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We've got this layer of ton.
We need to do modern art, as it was in the beginning of the last century.
Project implemented by St. Petersburg Grant
To be born into space
Earth's in danger.
Global warming or collision with the killer asteroid.
Spaceships with land on board are shipped to search for a reserve planet.
In order to preserve mankind, is there a major question about how to continue the birth of a newborn or on the same planet?
I think it's a small choice.
In fact, the present planet is only two that can be assumed at least hypothetically.
“This is Venus and Mars” is considered the senior scientific officer of the State Astronomical Institute, P.C. Sternberg (GAISH) Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions in Mars are more suitable for life, then the surface of Venus is 500 degrees Fahrenheit [500 ° C].
You can only live at high altitudes or at the orbit of Venus... in space.
It's a matter of reproduction in space starting with the flora.
More than half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
The four generations of the great ones who grew up in orbit were nothing different from their earthly varieties.
Then it's the extraction in the orbit of insectic, tiny fruit flies-drozofil.
In 1979, eggs were sent to space to check the development of embryos in pregnancy.
We're getting a perfectly normal bird out.
And that's where the problem continues.
"The problem of this bird's need to find resistance must rise to its feet and begin to move," explains the founder of the Institute of Medical Biological Problems (IMBP) RAN Vladimir Sichev.
I didn't find any resistance, the birds were indisputable.
In 10 hours, a complete atrophy of instincts occurred among newborns.
The birds did not respond to light and sound.
And the trouble was that four days later they just died.
"And twice we've spewed the birds, and then we refused, because it's just impossible to work with them there," says the experiment with the birds in the space of Vladimir Sichev.
With animals, the last time a biological miniach flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, on the Bion biosphere, there will be only one-sided persons.
There was a crisis experiment that had already been sent to space with fruit.
In principle, they didn't find anything supernatural.
"This was once on the biospheres, but again it was a single experiment, and such studies should be carried out," notes Vladimir Sichev.
After the landing of the space cruises, a seed appeared.
But to come to the problem of reproduction directly into space is not yet possible.
It's a simple task.
Animals, losing, the normal environment of their home, simply cannot achieve their sexual instinct.
But man, unlike animals, in principle, may.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking and able to create an emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not conducted.
But women in space have been flying for 50 years.
The biggest risk was in Teresco.
And the most precious thing about humanity is that it's a female organism.
Our Chika flew, and no one on Earth could say if he would keep it after flying into space.
If she's going to have a baby after this flight.
"No one has answered this question," says a veteran rocket-space industry in Wachtang Wacandze.
In June 1964, just a year after the flight to space, Valentin Tereskov's first female cosmonaut gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child Andrian Nikolaev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, Svetlana Savicka, a second cosmonaut, had a son who was born twice in orbit and even worked in open space.
However, the risk remains.
We don't have any units of cosmonauts that have all come up after long flights, and a healthy generation grows.
"And if more, it's dangerous even in orbital flights," is the result of the Cosmonaut Flyer, the Hero of the Soviet Union, the Hero of Russia Valerie Polakov.
However, mankind needs to look for some new ways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPC Hydrolaboratory is a mandatory phase of flight preparation.
Here, in a zero floating state, the cosmonauts develop open space working skills.
Water imitates virginity.
If for adult water, let it be comfortable, but still a stranger to the environment, then for breast-fed children, it is a natural nature.
Small self-esteems confirm that life on the ground has come out of the ocean.
There is a connection between having a baby for about 9 months with a mother in an incubator’s fluid, making it easier for her to get used to the shower later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the time of birth, from the time of the first bath, only two weeks have passed.
"It's very small to forget something," says a nurse named Marina Axenov.
In a word, if the baby's virginity is more natural, a woman needs gravity, the force of gravity.
Very quickly in pregnancy, the muscles of life, the taza, fall into the ability to extract the fruit.
All right, let's drop this by relying on birth control.
Of course, in a special camera, she's gonna pull him out.
"And what else?" asked Valerie Polakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling earthly tension, the organism does not form a skeleton and a muscle system.
It is not possible for a newborn to wear a special suit for training as an adult.
He's just going to be deprived of what he's going to need.
"And this experiment that we're going to go to, allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring a disabled, totally deadapted person to Earth," said the head of the Committee on Bioethics IMBP RAN Igori Pestov.
While the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
In time, however, it will be a reality when the land on their ships will go to a distant planet that will become a home for their descendants born in space.
Chief of the Chief Audit Office: Checking the system of fraud has failed on the part of politicians.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the availability of quality legislation, remains in application.
This is Miroslav Kala's statement, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office, in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think is not enough," commented Kala's current situation.
Such findings provide a joint inspection of the Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of wrong practices, Peter’s approach to the so-called fraud system led to what is called a fraud.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the GDP (Graditional Democratic Party) would not concern entrepreneurs with checks - is this prohibited or allowed?
“The law should be established in any way, and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of the institutions that are obliged to verify and strive for the fulfilment of the obligations,” says Cala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you discussed a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which compared public procurement legislation in both countries.
What exactly was this about?
There's a parallel check that we started two years ago.
Simply stated, that European legislation affirms how public procurement should be carried out, and national legislation should be followed and then applied in practice.
All the information was collected and, even when it was not yet finalized, interesting differences were found - simply to say, we could have the legislation "exactly and unequivocally", but in practice we are applying certain parameters to Germany.
Therefore, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself that it is not enough to establish more and more detailed rules.
And actually, how can this project help you, what does it mean to you?
That is what joint control can contribute to the efforts to stop the clarification of laws, reduce and improve restrictions, as this does not lead to a positive outcome.
The economy means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid wealth and possibly criminal behaviour.
But it's not the fact that we're going to achieve this by reducing the restrictions on orders.
It may be that the system will be overloaded with "bungague" so that those who want to find a lasagna in this system will find them much easier than if the restriction had not been reduced.
You are talking about the internal problems of the practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the German control system work?
Is there an organization such as our CIA (Control and Audit Office) or is it working otherwise?
As for institutions, there is also a college that works a little differently, but mainly both institutions operate in a similar way.
In addition, the powers to a certain extent are similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units and at federal land level, their system differs somewhat from our system.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal accounting chambers.
With regard to local legislation, is that just what we have?
Actually, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a model, but it cannot be said that it is best in all.
That's because they're better at controlling?
It's definitely not, but I repeat, I don't like these comparisons.
But it must be said that even exemplary countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't benefit from cooperation with our office, would they?
When it comes to domestic legislation, how has the amendment to the Public Procurement Act affected your institution, in some way have consequences?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is short enough, it has not yet appeared in our monitoring work.
As we control the fact, some delays need to be taken into account.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future verifications - we have started using our new instrument "Discovering the risk of inequality", through which we have pursued nearly 14,000 public contracts, we have analysed them, and these changes will, of course, take place because restrictions change, changing the conditions of some types of tenders and so on.
Do you think the adoption of this law would benefit or further burden the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules “will become worse” and will be impossible to comply with.
In the operation of the previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes with the regional council) that any non-compliance with the Government Procurement Act means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be strengthened in such a way?
I don't think so.
The system should exclude those who want to seize and abuse but not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the solution.
Such a system will only create an even greater pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this situation?
Let's be aware that this path will not lead anywhere.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the GDP will not concern entrepreneurs with the checks of the so-called fraud system.
"Swarz-system" prohibited or allowed?
The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of the bodies that are required to verify and seek to fulfil obligations.
We can say, "We change this law and let it go," but we can't say that we're going to pretend nothing's happening.
The Public Procurement Act contains a rather strict rule, as it should be formally implemented, and that is correct, which protects public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when a candidate with the best proposal is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think is not enough for us.
Roads are rocky, but mostly passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and snowy.
They're mostly passing, but they're somewhere more careful.
Carlow's Land
This morning, the roads were passing through the Carlovary coast, but they were frozen and snowy.
The temperature dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day it has to be slightly warmed.
The snowfall in the region ended only in the lows.
However, on the hills of the Red Mountains is about 30 centimeters [30 cm] of snow.
From the information received from the district road workers, it was known that the areas were less visible because of the fog.
The R6 high-speed road and first-class roads in the region are now underway without restrictions.
However, caution is needed, for example, on bridges where surface may be freezing and rocky.
All roads relating to the second and third classes, including mountain trails, are also accessible.
But in some of their areas there are still the remains of the frozen and the places of the frozen snow.
Special attention should be paid to the roads on the highlands.
Pardubic and Royal Landing
The Czech road and highway management on its websites informs that some of the Czech East's roads are in danger of ice, while on the high roads and high roads there may be a snowy layer.
Local road workers warn drivers of the ice which can be trained especially at the heights of the Paradubic coast.
Goloved can be around Lanskroun, Usti-on-Orliki, Polički, Switavi or High-Mito especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
The routes I/43 and I/34 located in Switzerland are treated by chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads of the Giant Mountains and the Orlick Mountains.
The snowy layer is located on the roads at the heights of Rihnova-on-Knejno and Trutnova.
In East Czechia today, there is a changing cloud with no precipitation.
The temperature usually varies from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, a light wind.
Pulsanian border
The roads in the Pulsen region pass this morning, but places need to be careful and adapt to the weather.
In the morning, the temperature fluctuates from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places, it may be rocky.
Drivers may encounter the fog but visibility will gradually improve.
Regional road workers provided information.
Shosse D5 is now almost without restrictions, but expensive managers are recommending caution between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of the first class roads have a dry and exhausting surface.
The frozen areas can be found in southern Plsa and Tahove.
The second and third class roads are wet, and in this case there is also a warning regarding the possibility of rolling sites.
Leaders should be cautious, especially on the few roads used in the Shumawa area.
Olomoutian border
The leaders of the Olomoucco region should today take into account snowflakes on the road.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Red Sea and on the road towards Videl Krsich.
On the night of the snowflake, the road workers, according to information from the road, dropped about three inches [3 cm] of snow in Shumperka.
In other parts of the road, there are usually no restrictions.
"On the heights of the Shumperka lies the remains of the snow.
Leaders on the side of Esenika must bear in mind the presence of snowflakes in the Red Sea," CHAN (Czech News Agency) today reported to the public of the Shumperk Road Administration.
At night the roads were cleared and their colleagues from Essenika, convinced them that the roads were bare and wet after the chemical treatment.
In Olomouce, roads are unrestricted, but in Sternberg, drivers must be careful at forest sites where moisture remains.
Ossetian border, Liberian border
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that a few difficult places remain.
According to information from the police database, in addition to several ice-cold or snow-cold areas, the mountain road is closed at the Telnica station in the Usteck region.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lows, so there is snow and ice on the roads, and in the lowlands, especially in the south-east of the Czech Republic, there is no problem, the roads are mostly dry.
The roadside difficulties are not yet reported.
Road workers report the rise of the ice in the county of Štety.
Meteorologists say that the ideal conditions for his education were created at night: the rain and the cover of snow all day, the sky was brightened at night and the frosts began.
Unfavourable conditions are reported on the main road and on track I/13 on the coast of Usteck and Liberia.
Because of the snowy layer of trees related to the road itself, it was necessary to close the road in Telnica at the Knica.
Simon Ornest: At the concerts we want to store positive energy
What do you think, less than a month later, should be the end of the light?
It's just one of the many disturbing news that we, people, are so easy to look at.
Together with the The Tap Tap Group, we are constantly shooting at this topic and we are saying that we are the only group in the world that will be able to collect enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Would you like to tell the readers more about this?
This is a national fund-raising event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing capacity of the May calendar, which was announced at 11:10 on 21 December.
On the day before that event, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava will be held in parallel on 20 December at 21:00.
They're going to end, hard to say, at a time when the May calendar will end in the Pacific island of Kiribati, the time zone of which will be 12 hours earlier than we have.
Who's got that idea in his head?
That was my idea, and we've all come up with our artist González Augustine.
In addition to the fact that we want to store enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about how we will ever hand this world over to our children.
In the event of the end of the May calendar, we have created a unique collection of items from shoes, shoes, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These items can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz and thus provide support.
The Tap Tap Group, along with other musicians, also filled the gymnastics against the end of the light, which is called "The End of the Light Off".
Will your favorite YouTube audiences sound gimmn at these beneficial concerts?
Of course, in the end, if the end of the world does not come.
It will be held by all performers at all concerts at the same time.
Gymnasium will also sound in the direct air of Czech television.
The words to this song were written and played by Jesus in the clip of Thomas Ghana, also participating in the performance of Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We also cooperate with other people in Czech cultural life, as we conduct many charitable activities and concerts.
We are trying to actively link them to these projects.
It turns out that a lot of people like to work with us, they're interested.
What's the big deal going to happen at the end of the world?
For the purchase of STUDEO's wireless educational centre, we have been working this way for the sixth year with the Tap civil association at the Edlikka Institute.
Teachers regularly visit students at the Edlicka Institute and conduct fun and interesting activities with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and we are trying to give them this opportunity.
As part of the project for the further construction of the Edlikka Institute in the future, there will be a separate building in which we will move with the project.
There will be several music groups and performers at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We have sought to establish a programme that interests all generations, including children.
For example, there are Chinese, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Irži Suhi in Prague.
Both details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any such “magnificent activities” in the future?
In May, for the first time, we will take part in the Prague Spring Festival, and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
The following year, we would be pleased to have a presentation at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we were in the United States, would very much like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
In view of your serious plans, you have already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap Group is a group of people with limited opportunities.
How do you deal with the cost of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it looks at first sight.
We have five participants in electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs must travel to the luggage office, plus a large number of trucks and boxes.
The Czech ČSA and British Airways have always been excellently prepared for us, and I have been surprised to see how many times I have been surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we've just been back, it's all gone without problems.
By going abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public relations with disabled people and so on.
What have you been up to now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we do, in Russia we have witnessed that there is still a basic level in the east.
Compared to Prague in Moscow, there are many barriers, and there are still people in the wild on the electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
Also, there is no such thing as walking the path of the disabled in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already public organizations that are trying to draw people's attention to the problems of people with limited opportunities.
What, on the contrary, should we always reach out to the best countries?
There's a lot of stuff that's far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it's perfectly normal that people with a severe form of disability move on their own in the streets, can go to the bathroom, in the museum, wherever they want...
It is not very common that a large number of people with limited opportunities are actively involved in public life, and in this we are a little out of the way with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or freedom of the public is one thing, but at a time when we have famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, everything will really change.
As long as it's a single case, it's people with a strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is currently very popular, but let's go back two years ago, what made you organize it in 1998?
I went to the Edlicka Institute as an educator, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician myself, and I'm also playing on the saxophone, I've organized an interesting music circle with my colleague.
Well, in time, as our leader Lady Angelovic says, it's a little out of control.
The popularity has come only in recent years, or am I on the way?
That's true, it helped us to start joining famous singers and work actively on the propaganda of the group.
We have come to the conclusion that the work that no one can assess is essentially as if it did not exist.
Through the means of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Did you have the goal of breaking the Tap Tap so well?
From the beginning, I felt their potential to do something unusual.
The show business is full of things that reflect each other.
This is logical, everything is taken with caution, and it takes a long time.
There are very few things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us is, of course, pity, it's natural...
But this grief is far too much, because people with limited possibilities are not some suffering and all the abandoned persons we should regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities get something, it's not just for them, it's for society as a whole.
Have you been successful in being a strict leader, as many consider you to be?
If we want to work qualitatively, we must be in a lot of uncompromising and have certain discipline.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and fly in the clouds, and when they know that twice a week they have to go to rehearsals, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose their enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently, the Tap Tap Group is composed of 20 people.
How many were there in early 1998?
Only one Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's impossible to prevent.
For those who have the will and the power of will, our doors are always open.
It will be held by day before the expected end of the light, on Thursday, 20.12.2012, at 2 p.m.
The concert will take place in Prague at the Incheba Stadium, in Brno, at the Fléda and Ostrave Club, in the centre of Plynoj with 12 groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are joined by a telecom at the time of playing the song group The Tap Tap "The End of Light Is Off".
The objective of the project is to raise funds of SEK 25 million for the purchase of multifunctional wireless equipment for the educational centre STUDDEO at the Edlicka Institute in Prague.
The ticket is 400 kroner for children under 12 years of age free of charge. Tickets can be purchased in Bohemiaticket in advance.
Poland and space.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as a second country from the former eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ECA in 1994 and participated actively in a number of Agency projects over the years.
But the way to the cosmos of Poland began a long time ago.
By the time World War II, Polish enthusiasts had made their way into space, but this was not always understood.
I recall, for example, the lecture A. Sternfeld, which presented to the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933 an idea from his innovative work "Introduction into cosmonautique".
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the audience with an equal spirit, and after several years Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won Robert Esno-Peltri and Andre Luis Hirsch's "Introduction to Cosmonautique".
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a major advocate of astronomy and cosmonautique.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
The Chadomian became known as the world propaganda of cosmonautique, and his contribution was assessed, including that one of the craters on the other side of the Moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925, a railway drench was built in Poland, equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as was the project's details.
Not even clear, a rocket should have been used to drive or to power the body.
Information on this site is only known from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery has begun to think about missiles.
The study was conducted by the Arms Technology Section, in cooperation with Professors Michislav Wolfke and Gustav Mozzicki.
The remaining materials show that the studies have been carried out in the course of practical tests.
But with the arrival of the German forces, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the specialized press came up with the idea of a photoretardant rocket, proposed by the Rogozinski engine, and the following year, the work “Air Torpedo and Air Missile Bomb” was carried out by the author of Leviva-Czeibolocko.
Both projects were designed for the military use of missile engines.
Prior to the war itself, all projects of military use of missile technology were undertaken by the Temporary Scientific and Advisory Committee (Tymczysowe Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work, the work was completed due to the beginning of the war.
The next scientific work on cosmonautique appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautique Society (Polish Society of Astronautique).
For the first time, the issue of society was mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the “Problems” magazine, which published four volumes of articles on astronomy.
In one of them, Professor Sobotovic proposed to organize a society that would deal with cosmonautism.
At the time, the projects of artificial satellites were already underway, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (POA) has tried to enter the International Astronautic Federation (based in 1951) and has already become its true member in the autumn.
And next year, the first President of POA Kazimej Zarankevic (1902-1959) became Vice President of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained in the post until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the POA has made a significant contribution to the development of a very successful meteorological missile RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which has become the first Polish rocket to conduct a scientific study.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first started on 10 October 1958.
The rocket capable of overcoming 1800 m was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
An improved version of RM-1A was subsequently built, and two-step RM-2 rocket tests were conducted in the Bledwood Desert in 1959.
The rocket was about 1.4 m long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already capable of carrying out the current scientific work - the RM-34 missile could exceed 14.5 km, and its task was to monitor the high winds.
But further development was suspended in 1962.
The first RM-type successor was the Meteor-1 missile, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed to be two-step, its overall length was 510 cm, and the primary weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (defined as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which were different in size from the camera for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket had an area of 0.4 l, Meteor-1B - 0.34 l, and Meteor-1C - 0.62l.
The maximum length of the flight in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, and its first summer tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with an initial weight of 380 kg was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
Then the Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland ' s accession to COSPAR in 1960 and the establishment of a national committee of COSPAR two years later.
In addition, as part of the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in space research on Soviet artistic satellites, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslav Hermasevsky became the second intercosmonate after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Law on Public Works is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the Law on Public Works.
The decision led to a lively discussion in society.
It would certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of multidimensional, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This relates to the principle of free trade and to the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, along with unscrupulous financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the value of the labour force (wage) there is a price tension.
The concept needs to be understood when the manufacturer, through the delivery of the cheap goods, tries to stay in economic competition by "screaming" the value of the competitor in order to take up most of the market and thus increase its own income.
In general, this means that for most entrepreneurs, whether the transfer of production abroad or cheap purchases abroad, or the disappearance thereof, unemployment is increasing in countries where the value of labour is higher than in others.
Since private capital does not bear any social responsibility, including for its unemployment, the inevitable costs of the State increase for social needs.
In general, the situation is exacerbated by the unwillingness of employers to pay taxes and thus compensate for the social and economic damage they suffer in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well-known that there is no need to provide specific statistics.
Non-ceremony methods of private capital create at the level of economies of individual States where Governments of countries are forced to compete with each other to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, Governments are giving their own population a lease of private capital, despite social decline.
This is reflected primarily in the changes in existing legislation.
The objective is to make its people economically subject to the dictatorship of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This acts as an economic coercion system in the case of long-term unemployment while at the same time serving as a tool to cut workers ' rights in the field of labour law.
As a result, poverty is increasing, while the difference between the poor and the rich is growing.
For several years there has been a public distribution of food to poor people who are unable to feed themselves with their own labor.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
In the context of increasing competitiveness in the German economy, there are always cases where workers receive such wages that the State must pay them to obtain a minimum of living.
A similar scandal has also been reported to the public in the case of additional Bundestag workers.
Economic measures in almost all of the EU's southern states undoubtedly result in the same situation where people under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in social status are forced either to migrate, as in the 19th century, or to have a poor pay at the expense of society in the hope that private investment will ever come into the country.
But where is he to be taken from?
If the capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as the Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians, Africans still work for European wages.
It's all Latin America.
The liberal theory and the mass media claim that the State is unable to participate in the ownership capital, which leads to an economic catastrophe.
The private capital insists that the State should not be involved in the economy by administrative action.
Should we further respond to the question whether private capital, now practically governing policies and thus the entire State, is in its own selfish interests?
The only answer is yes.
Evidence is the existence of nearly all-powerful and remote lobbying in all States.
As a result, we have an inexhaustible situation in corruption, mutual benefit, legislation where almost everything deserves punishment, but it is not a crime.
In FRG, the situation is that public ministries, due to the lack of funding, have been entrusted with the development of draft laws to private legal firms that are closely related to industry.
The bill then approved the Bundestag.
All power is not based on the people, as the Western Constitution states, but on financial and power groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal democracy is now rapidly emerging in the situation described by Appian in the creation of "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey": "The State has long broken down, and the institutions are engaged in violence.
Takeovers, illegal receipt of mercy through stones and swords.
Encouraging and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people went to the election with an earlier vote"...the ordinary people did not at all get into the office of governor, at the end of the day the State remained without a consulate for eight months........................................]]]] ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... for the was spent spent for the was spent for the was spent for the was spent for for the was spent for the spent for the last for the last for the last spent for the spent spent for the spent for the spent for the last spent for the spent for the last for the last for the last spent for the last for the last for the last for the last spent for the last spent spent spent for the spent for the last spent for the spent for the last spent for the last for the last for the last for the last for the last spent for the last spent for the spent spent for the last spent for the spent for the last spent for the last spent for the spent for the spent for the last spent for the last session for the last spent for the last for the
As in ancient times, in today’s society, selfless interests prevail, without taking into account public interests.
Private capital is not, in fact, intended to be used for public purposes.
The present result is not different from the past: the disproportionate decline of the elite without any effort to reform deeper.
That is why the fascist and communist regimes have been established, and we must look for the senseless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal democracy can be seen as a certain break, followed by the next round.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of future victims, the humanitarian and social disasters that we have already seen, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Law on Public Works is not a decision or, at least, not always.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and national and European levels, the Czech Government will have to continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the State ' s left participation in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the governance of the State, and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Trouble lab.
"There will be nothing out of violence, and there will never be a way out" is Sting, the song "Hrunky," where the main text is, "We don't forget what we're crooks."
"If my sons hadn't wanted a war, they wouldn't have been." The dying Güll Schnaper, Meera Amschel Rothschild's wife.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, caused many reactions.
Some speak for Israel by arguing that it has the right to self-defence, while the Palestinians act as terrorists, while others support the Palestinians by arguing that the Israeli State is racist, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is attributed to the role of a terrorist State.
I do not want to think about who were born in these periodic repeated killings - a criminal, and who, at the end of the day, the Israelis, including self-government territories, were born at the moment of the current political situation, and were not witnesses of the beginning of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look at the entertainment, to look at those who have been serving above all for the past 95 years (regarding the signing of the Balfort Declaration in November 1917) in a small area of the Middle East.
Some of my discussions are supported by historical facts, some of which are based on my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily the history of the struggle for power.
In each age, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What's not so clear is whether these people have always taken their own steps or stood behind their throne by someone who has led them to the pre-destined goals.
We should be allowed to live at a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of several people, and that the concentration of money and the resulting power could not have occurred for the life of a single generation.
Among the astronomically rich families there is one that could be seen as the head of the floor (I don't know if anyone is standing over them, but it's not going to be off) - Rothschild.
They don't write much about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) has already purchased in the 1990s to stop hearings linking them to criminal acts in the higher spheres in which they were in darkness, which have always led to their strengthening of power, increase of wealth or at the same time, and to others.
They have large stock packs in almost all central banks of the world and against countries in which central banks do not have their share, hold or prepare war (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the Kadhafi merger there were only four, but at the same time the Russian Government took the central bank of its country into its hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain the status of the central bank for the Rothschild Bank of America, and during the civil war he began to issue his own (governmental) money and was killed in the theater in 1865.
John F. Kennedy began to issue his own money and wanted to cancel the FED (Federal Reserve System), was killed in 1963. Deputy Luis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to bring the FED to court for the resolution of the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their desire for world power from 1859 to 1871 led to the development of a plan of three world wars, established by the 33rd-large mason Albert Pike.
The task of the first war was the destruction of the monarchy States in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially Britain, and the third was to bring about a reduction in the world population of about 0.5-1 billion people (a number of slaves will be sufficient to ensure their comfort and shine, and they will not need many resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism can be nothing but a prerequisite for such a project) and the final seizure of absolute power.
The method used by the group of the richest families in the head with the Rothschilds is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent proposal for solutions (order ab chao - order of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of the EDF, which was to prevent the recurrence of the crisis they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they were able to unravel World War I through the murder of the Habsburg heir to the Austrian Hungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Imperial Russia, starting the multi-wisdom revolution.
The first world war ended suddenly, unwarranted in the military and economic respect of the capitalization of Germany (there was no need for war to destroy the king of Russia) and, as a result, the Central European Power, Austria, was fragmented.
In order to facilitate the deployment of the Second World War, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation by imposing huge military repairs on Germany, rather than creating a prerequisite for the radicalization of the depleted masses, and then it was only left to push Germans with a strong, responsible and offering simple solutions to the leader, to further create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and indeed to play the function of the fifth column in the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, Rotschildi provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one of which sought to establish a Jewish State, preferably in the area of historical Judah with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfort declaration provided a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks have taken place on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, it was difficult to assess whether Hitler had been expelled from the ranks where he was originally held by the bankers, or all he had done was planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, as Germany was driven by military repairs to the Second World War, the State of Israel had been declared to be a means of creating a front of the third war.
If the international bankers can untie it, the Jewish people, as in the second world war, will be the victim of the war on the front, now with the Arab or, more simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of strife and chaos not only within the country, but also at the international level (to take only a sharp division of people against Israel's opponents and opponents).
Who is guilty, and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where the insult is the result of an endless chain of violence if it all begins with the desire of individuals and their desire for the world power?
There is a need to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders here, because, as we do, international bankers are urging people to vote on their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister of Israel, Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international banker, who is doing all he can to start war with Iran, which, through Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to become a world conflict, and taking into account Iran's control over the Ormous River, which contains 20% of all world oil stocks (the sea corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a common crisis, and people will receive a new world order."
The new world order in their presentation is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serve a harsh financial aristocracy that enjoys comfort.
A world where every birthing organism is implanted by a chip with which it becomes a material under total control.
"And compels all small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to have on their right hand or on their foreheads, so that a man who is not marked by the name of that beast, or by the number of his name, may not buy nor sell.
Here is wisdom: Anyone with reason can calculate the number of animals.
Because it corresponds to the human name, and the number is sixty-six.
"Operation Argo": When something's worse, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamic Protestant students seized the US Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats into custody.
They had to be released in exchange for Mohammed Reza Pehlevi, a renegade after the U.S. revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the US administration, the positive outcome of the situation was not expected - it was unable to allow itself to throw the chess on board because it could undermine the trust of allies in other countries.
However, to achieve the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not in a position to do so.
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by an unsuccessful attempt to free hostages by force.
The diplomats were finally released 444 days later, after negotiations with the Government of Algeria.
Their fate caused the house to be filled with solidarity and anti - Iran.
The defeat in Iran greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980s presidential elections, which ended with Ronald Reagan.
The film by Actor Ben Afflém "Operation Argo" describes one of the episodes of the story that brought small victories to America.
Soon before the occupation of the Embassy, six workers were able to escape.
After a difficult period, they completed their journey to the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, with the help of an extravaganced cover legend that they had gone to Canadian passports as members of a semantic group searching for a place in the country for a science and fantasy era.
Group of genders
The plan that invented an evacuation expert, Tony Mendes, demanded the cooperation of Hollywood.
In order to be credible, specialized journals wrote about the film project, held press conferences, and the proposed production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept in secret for a long time, a film based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
The Aflek film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political thriller, called the movie cinemapus, is the story of a successful mystery, and the affair can be an example of a number of movies about the friends of Ouchen.
The film is constantly changing - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (the headlines show significant historical photographs of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no major differences in that).
On the other hand, light-headed Hollywood cracks that cross with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions, the men in the costumes are discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, on the desks of the institutions, on the phone ...
Ben Afflek has been able to make a great start in his career.
From an actor, he became a respected director, and his game ceased to be an object of laughter.
Operation Argo his third full-meter film, after the dark detective "Perish, child, forgive" (2007) and the Triller "Gorod" (2010).
At the same time, this is the first film of Afklek, which is not recorded in the hometown of the director of Boston.
The feeling of the local atmosphere is related to the qualities that have increased the director's earlier films over the Hollywood standard.
And Aflek shows it in Argo, where Tegeran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, when real events are reconstructed, the introductory scenes of the message drop impress their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when history suddenly changes.
The same effect is achieved by Aflek and his colleagues on the stage of the inventions (partial headquarters in the Tegeran base).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the report did not imply the number of cinematographic scenes.
He's working pretty well with this little one, sometimes something he thinks -- it's not so elegant out there (the scene in which a phone call in America prevents an overcrowding crisis at Tegeran Airport, and the airfields look pretty clever).
The lack of Argo is a dissertation associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood colleagues are indeed very promising, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are far from unique in the film.
The Afleka film is not full of dramaism, it is a film that can be viewed with moderate interest, evaluating the situation and the retro-style that re-establishes the seventies.
But he's busy.
However, this is enough to remind us of one, still known in the sense of living history, as well as to give evidence of the exaggerated perceptions of all-powerful and knowledgeable specialized services.
Airplanes, bananas and circuses
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual survey of the most absurd banking collections, has now decided to announce a competition for "the very absurd order or project from the Master's EU".
"We have been encouraged by this latest event, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of large European companies," said researcher Patrick Nager.
Among those already nominated for absurdities is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the rate of insurance contributions for men and women.
To date, women have had life insurance benefits, because insurance companies are at a lower risk objective.
"Further incredible ideas from the Master's EU can be presented in competition by the end of this year.
The vote alone will take place by the end of February 2013," Nager said.
The EU's contested orders include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which results in damage to nature and the prohibition on the use of reliable mercury gradients only because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances, or a directive on the size of the chicken cell, resulting in substantial egg travel this year.
Critics have also been prohibited from using the term "butterbrown oil" or from selling classical lamps.
Quality bananas shall be 14 centimeters long.
A common European apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of a trade or industrial lobby whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by a State or a group of States (the Czech Republic is now even at the risk of a vetting the requirements of its banks).
The interests of the lobby are: for example, the top quality bananas in the European Union should have reached a length of 14 cm and should not have been "anomalous".
However, the European Commission was justified in harmonizing only the existing different national rules that made trade more difficult.
The EU, despite the resistance of some States, has nevertheless softened the standards for fruit and vegetables, recalling that the existing directives will lead to product dispersal.
The candidate for victory in the survey may also become an EU last year ruling that the air-sellers must be required to provide a warning that children under eight years of age cannot push them without adult care.
The EU has referred to American studies that the air bubbles in the game are a potential cause of the death of children by drowning.
Such a restriction is now extended to children under the age of 14 who are not allowed to go to jail.
Fun ideas are born at home
It is absurd enough to rule on the European officials themselves: everyone who holds an official position in the EU cannot, given the sensitivity of the subject to Greece, use the name of Macedonia and should instead speak "BURM" (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com portal, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists, Laissez Fair, proposed a vote, in addition to several of the above-mentioned absurd rules, such as the EU food stock rule in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has established the maximum amount of food stocks that may be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union.
The Czech Republic subsequently exceeded, for example, the quantities of preserved mushrooms, for which it was threatened by a large fine.
The organizers of the questionnaire also had an interest in paying some countries for their lack of sea and the idea of granting grants to the grant application.
But these ideas came up in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We're in a bad situation because we don't have a sea.
We will ask for compensation from the European Union," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (HRDP) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the country had a high crop of grain, and as a result of so-called intervention procurements, the State had full stockpiles that had to be exported.
Because the Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to the Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission met in the Czech Republic and organized a tender for the purchase of seed from countries that did not have access to the sea.
Grants for grants were proposed by the Ministry of Regional Development, led by the Minister Paul German (US-DEU), in particular, such grants had to be made for a grant application from Brussels.
EU: Amazing orders are an exception
While decisions in Member States are easily criticized, the EU's regulatory efforts, as well as the more efficient functioning and development of the European Union, in the opinion of many experts, deserve greater recognition.
It is a serious problem, in the opinion of the experts, that EU grants to projects that do not even have a clue about something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which Member States have achieved in the discussions on the budget.
The Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, as well as in other countries of the European Union, and it does not always win the competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with Germans and Austrians, retained the name "Olomutskian Reds", but "Tuzemski rom", whose traditions in our country are rooted in the 19th century, our producers had to be renamed "Tuzemak".
The name of the rome may be limited to the products of the rosary distillate, not of the sugarcane.
The official list of EU registered products, along with the world-famous raw materials "feta" and "gorgondzol", a marzipan from the German Länder or the Parma vine, has already been produced, for example, carnivorous sugars, peas and peacocks and jasmine.
The EU's trade mark can also be proud of a pardubic cleaner and bitter pipes.
People want me to keep a republic, but I'm a fan, says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a man come to the head to be a president?
I don't think about becoming a senator or president.
If we had all worked out in the country, I wouldn't be in trouble.
But I can't see how the country has developed over the last 20 years, how the holes are going, people are raising taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to figure out how to change it.
And since I'm forty years old and I'm an independent person who's not a party, I have no other way to influence things than to be a senator or president.
You fell into the Senate, but soon you went to the President's castle.
Will you not then turn your backs on the people who have chosen you?
I have always said that I am involved in the fight for the presidential castle, depending on the outcome of the Senate elections.
Later, I made it clear that if I was elected a senator, I'd be in the presidents.
My goal is not a post, a post is an instrument that I can use to carry out my views.
That is why I need the most influence and the most extensive powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we're like a nation in our own bar or TV, but that we're willing to melt everyone who's trying to change something.
This is added to the media that black people and that distort freedom of speech with the freedom of the lie.
For example, I was told that I'm giving a reception to the journalists, or that I was a adviser to Irji Paroubeka.
Let's go to your views.
You have begun the fight for the presidential castle with statements about the material and criminal liability of politicians and the return of property declarations of more than twenty million.
In order to do so, it is necessary to amend the law.
You have no such authority as President, and only a whole Senate can propose laws.
How would you like to solve this problem?
When I, as a citizen, lobbyed for excursions to become a free enterprise, it was possible to move forward.
The problem is politics: when someone comes with a good offer to the left or the right, he is deliberately hampered by obstacles, and this prevents citizens.
As an independent non-partisan, I have much greater capacity to receive support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can, without a lot of stock, take what is best for our country and apply it to each party without looking at the dogmas.
Do you view yourself as a person who is more concerned with the right or the left?
From a Czech point of view, I think people are more likely to treat me as left-handed.
It doesn't matter to me at all - a little left or a little right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
It's not about someone being right, but someone being left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any good solution for society, whether it will be proposed by the CPCM or by the GDP, and I will be against the wrong idea.
You get angry when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
It can be called populism, but all the suggestions I'm talking about are already working in the world, or are spoken of by prominent experts.
But without Parliament's support, you'll be left with only slogans.
And that's why you won't be in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to carry out criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have another chance.
Just convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to turn them on their own, so that we can achieve our own.
If I had been elected President, it would not have been a problem to organize a direct television broadcast, in which I would appeal to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legalize material and criminal liability for politicians, public officials, judges and prosecutors.
And if they don't, they'll have to report why they don't want to.
If there is a strong person who will sound abusive, political pressure can be put on the scene.
Take the President's direct election - it was a public pressure.
I'm telling you, I'm not a fan, I'm not a genius, I'm not an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies to resist my beliefs and views.
I am only a politician, and I am trying to get the support of the majority for my programme.
I am trying to move on my own; in case this fails, I will end up in six years and return to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura's supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything, so I've visited a number of famous people with a proposal to be a member of the Senate.
I went to Radi Janchure, he gave up a lot of work.
I also supported at least the leading investigation by journalist Jan Laurentzov, who exposed fraud with light fuel products.
I put out my candidacy because people are really unhappy, but now I feel like I'm pregnant.
Sixty per cent of the people did not vote, but the majority of those who had elected representatives of the institution.
Only two of us are independent in the Senate.
People chose the Senate so that changes would be made with difficulty.
In spite of this, I will fight for my views, such as the direct election of mayors and governors.
You think about the basis of your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the purity of the past of every potential proponent, and I don't have the money.
There's no money on the presidential campaign, only twenty thousand crowns on my transparent account.
You don't have the money?
You're talking about property declarations, and how do you deal with it?
Personal property is estimated to be approximately 60 million.
I have a site in Prague worth about 25 million, a 10 million apartment, another 8 million apartment, a collection of art produced about 10 million, aston Martin by 3.5 million, and Skoda Superb by a million, plus a few million on account.
As for Aston-Martin, I showed up because it was my little dream - I always liked James Bond, who rode in the car, was gallant with women, and at the same time fought against dishonesty and lawlessness.
You're driving to Aston Martin, you own 60 million property and you don't have any money on the campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million on the campaign.
Should I go into debt?
I've already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that my program is not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for a pre-election campaign from my dress.
The campaign costs me in fact will cover the senator's salary.
But I wouldn't live on that money, for example, I couldn't pay my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't have gotten into it.
So you're going to keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd cut down on this activity?
But it doesn't depend on the size of the pay.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, the director of the tourism agency will be my deputy in the spring.
People would like me to be an unscrupulous man who will keep the Republic.
But I also need to live for something.
How much, as an entrepreneur, did you get used to it every month?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, that's what I get.
And if I were to become president, I would end my business.
You'll find a full interview on Saturday's issue of the "Right" newspaper.
Architects of MVRDV prove that these adventures are not only imaginary - for example, Speikenis and his recently built Book Mountain - 2 photos
"I think this building is fun, it looks futuristic, and finally we can see something interesting again," says Lisette Verhaig, walking on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist in the vicinity of a large company, thinks, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I wonder, why do we have another library today?
Everyone has Internet, iPad and electronic books.
Now no one volunteers to go to such old - fashioned libraries, right?
Speikenis, a small, sleepy town under Rotterdam, is an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
A few years ago, it was decided to contribute to common education and to build seven imaginary bridges, which are shown on euro banknotes, in the form of beautifully decorated iron-beneficial miniatures.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city’s fathers realized that they had the only opportunity to resist the statistics: to build a library here!
Vinny Maas of the Rotterdam Architectural Bureau MVRDV, master of bold column charts and author of bold, sometimes even cynical structures, addressed the challenge of his normal incompetence and appeared at a competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under the mouse and the perversion of the face.
As long as the jury's members looked at and ate with their shoulders, the tough Maas put out of his original pyramid gift and concluded his project's defense by saying, "Dear citizens!"
That's my proposal: "The Book Mountain" in Spain, so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain was worth 30 million euros.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes a underground garage, a supermarket, mail and a number of houses and taunhauses belonging to it, with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Book Mountain was marked by the second award of the 2012 Lucerne Library of the Netherlands.
The project also participates in the 2012 Dutch National Timber Competition.
Thus, the unique prefabricated area, which had previously been able to offer nothing but a postmodern pedestrian zone and an amazingly unpretentious rat, with white facades referring to the dairy industry, has become richer for a modern construction of architecture.
But the main thing is that Spain was the first in the history of this city's public cultural destination building.
A Long Path to a Book
First impression: the book Eldorado under the cheese cup.
There is only one elevator in the center of the mountain massif, because the present worshipers of architecture and reading would prefer to study this location on foot.
From all sides, the room is bright and easy to see, the fields of the worshiped brick and elegant street flags create a sense of public urban space.
The city environment is restored perfectly.
Looks like they're looking for rocks, dogs and football boys and girls.
And everywhere -- books, books, books.
"The bookshelves usually stand along the facades, and there is a large dark hall in the middle, usually impenetrable and indiscriminate," says Vini Maas.
We put the classic configuration of the space from the head to the head and pulled out the area to read inside.
The interior area of the Book Mountain has been well used: the centre has offices, internet libraries, chess clubs, environmental centres and technical facilities.
In particular, the black bookmakers who serve the wall section, the parapets, and the lattice pearls rejoice.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even experienced architects and construction engineers are lost in suspicion, which is for unknown material.
"We tried to work with secondary materials," explains Jop Trauborst, project manager representing the Speikenis community, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once on a farm in Frisland, we met the right side product of agriculture.
For many years, in carpets and fields in the Netherlands, the artificial fibre material of a millimetre thickness has been used as a base under the root.
It's cheap and saves time.
A thin textile serves one or two seasons, then it can be removed.
For the library, this canvas was pressed in four centimeters thick for the first time.
Under the heat and pressure of the so-called Landbauplastics (KLP), it becomes a dark, uniform, durable material, with a bit of a new car and a bit of cross-section.
There's 105 degrees to the top.
Those who cross the road nearly 500 meters long will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city but also with Dutch croquets and wooden figurines in the hills.
They are concerned about the atmosphere and, above all, about the correct humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
Costs per new soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite the many glass surfaces, is a model eco-project," Trouborst says.
The heat of the earth is used for heating and cooling.
Although the Book Mountain stands under a glass cup, even in the bright days of the sun, it is only for a short time.
Large wooded farms, which have a perpendicular glass facade, provide shade and absorb most of the sun’s rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is provided with fully automatic wheelchairs.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned earlier, has already visited a new library.
Lisette Verhaig was here, too.
And also a professor of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogard, who called Bukenberg "the soul of the Spaniards, which has long been unfathomable."
Reason: A few weeks before the opening of the book, each person received an invitation to offer a book from his own congregation.
These books were to be held in empty spaces on the shelf, not yet fully equipped library - at that time there were 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The poles are stuck up.
"There's nothing worse than a half-storey library," says architect Vinny Maas.
"I think that, by our invitation, every resident is somehow connected to this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if she serves only for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV was able to solve a royal task, which is called the creation of identity in the professional jargon.
Spakeniss wrote his literary story.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It's just the starting point for identifying.
Sabo: "Germans must play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Sabo, an expert on U.S. and Europe's links, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first admitted that it had voted against the Palestinians ' request for observer status with the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
Why?
Stefan Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be cautious about its special relations with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that she does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, while not being too critical of Israel.
During the rise in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the introduction of a restricted zone for flights.
As a result, NATO made this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The case is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, that is, from a policy that, in effect, has been managed by the United States to a German foreign policy.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that Europeans do not have a unified policy.
Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that as long as they do their part, they are on their way to "more normal" foreign policy.
Such an external policy by France or the United Kingdom.
What specifically does "normal" foreign policy mean in German terms?
It is a willingness to take a position that is not dependent on the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, on exports and connections to certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany ' s economic interests differ significantly from those of other major States, and Germany should therefore protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has major markets for sale in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
It therefore needs to be careful not to offend the public and the elite in Arab countries.
In any case, it plays its part.
But I wouldn't give that too much importance, it's not a completely unilateral connection.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Did Germany harm its relations with the United States by refraining from making important decisions, such as the Palestinian vote?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States, there is an understanding of the German position.
So I don't think it was the same dramatic fate as in the Libyan question.
Germany may even gain some respect in this way.
This signals that it should be taken seriously as a game in the international arena and that its interests should be taken into account.
There are various views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States of America, on the other hand, has made a clear statement about the veto.
Is there a distinction between the United States and many European States?
Because of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama Government in depth has sufficient understanding of the European position.
However, in view of the local political situation, the Government cannot, of course, take such a position openly.
I believe that substantial differences in opinion are not as significant as it always seems.
If you are considering the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, note that Obama is not at all in a hurry to the policy of Netanyahu.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the situation of an important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for Germans.
Of course, Germans would be somewhat simpler if there were a single, non-controversial European policy, but that is not the case now.
Therefore, they cannot take a broader approach and are forced to act instead, based only on their own vision.
That's what they do with the euro.
I think that Germany will play a leading role in developing a common European position in the future.
It is understandable that it is not easy for Germany to do so, at least in connection with Israel.
That was always a bit of a subject.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, won't it really play a major role?
Or is the leading role still difficult for Germany?
Germany has not been used to this, and it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany assumes an important role, the most diverse anti-German feelings appear.
The Germans are not just dealing with this.
Actually, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the United States.
It should take into account the different neighbours and views, and that was not easy.
So, the impact of the United States on European politics is constantly weakening, but at this point the EU does not fill this vacuum, which then remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
Even if you do not like it, it makes you feel uncomfortable or makes you feel uncomfortable.

"Protection of trademarks" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren - too.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is a very officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the companies from which it is established.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names submit a claim.
However, it is not clear if they will be able to stand up for their rights.
" Foreigners are becoming increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer of Taylor Wessing, who specializes in violations of the trademark rights in the Far East.
On my desk every week, there's a new case of this kind.
To the simulators it is sufficient to add a few letters to get the right to register their trade marks.
This is how Lu-Gucci gets from Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German companies are legally copied, such as the Puma manufacturer of sports goods.
The folder shall be opened with the registration office of the trade mark in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, the Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trade mark, which also uses the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zenga.
The fact that the Chinese are the world champions for copying and violating intellectual property rights is known.
In large cities, there are multi-story universities that sell almost exclusively subcontractions.
However, Pattloh's case is not the case, and according to his creditors, he is opposed to the fact that the Chinese companies have been officially granted the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere from the registration of trademarks.
The Chinese call it the ban minipai, the passenger brand.
This word is associated with the "ban dakuan."
That's what they call women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not accept guilt
"It harms the business, and it has to be fought," Pattloch is convinced.
"The trade mark is missing, the unique situation is lost, the image is very much hurt."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected sectors are estimated by millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China sells 15 billion euros a year to the third largest and fastest market for the sale of luxury items.
However, it is difficult to remove the questionable entries in the trade marks register, and it is worth it.
The process can take up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Pattloch tells of cases in which the court dismissed the claims, since after a long period of time the contested title became "the reality of the market".
If the applicant fails to do so, he will even have to pay the plagiarism because he has damaged his trade mark in China, Patloch says.
Sometimes the jungle law rules here.
There are also famous cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had a court dispute with the manufacturer of Sany’s construction machines, an enterprise that had recently acquired a Putzmeister concrete-producing company.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The previously-bought Volvo Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
The fashion product manufacturer Lacoste lost copies of Hong Kong and Singapore in China, where the famous crocodile looked on the other side.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves to be guilty.
The notice of registration of CTMO trademarks in Beijing confirms that in 2010 there were difficulties due to the lack of staff and equipment in the premises.
But last year, there was a "return from the emergency to the normal process".
Thus, the number of unprocessed cases of objections decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
At least 81,500 claims are still pending in the department.
Fighting this price is worth it.
As often as in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, more than 1.4 million trade mark protection applications were made to CTMO, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record means that China has, for the tenth time, managed a list of new registrations worldwide, reported by the department.
The same applies to the total number of actual trade marks, totaling 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan fees were paid.
To simplify, this means that each registration is worth an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
It is worth a lot more, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the concert has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarism.
The Germans were able to obtain that the illicit production of their false car details had been eliminated.
However, the copycat secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trade mark.
This was its own omission, as the Germans were not protected, says Hanno Ventcler, president of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities government in Munich.
And the CTMO trade mark registration agency rejected the Munich claim.
True, Freudenberg has won in both of the following instances, but the opposing party continues to fight so far.
Need to be on the lookout
The question is now before the Supreme Court.
Ventcler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and commends the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money, and nerves."
The company's archives had to review even the centuries-old acts to produce evidence if internal costs were not being taken into account.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unresolvedly proposed to the opposing party "a large six-digit amount in euro" for a settlement.
"From here it's clear how much it costs us," says Ventcler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten even to move to Europe.
That is, if the simulators register unprotected trade marks there.
Thus, one Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long ceased its production in these areas, but has been able to prevent registration.
"We need to wait," says Ventcler.
Both he and Patloch's lawyer recommend that German companies be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international provisions for the protection of trademarks; foreigners should rather “all that is to be protected, also registered in China”, says Ventcler.
Otherwise, it could be much more valuable than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses his trade mark drama in the last act, he will have to pay the other party's license fees for his own name, explains Ventcler.
Otherwise, we're being driven out of the market in a controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: To drown, sing, help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi chorus repeats, and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans rejoice.
The history of relations over 8733 kilometers.
The first is a flood: cowboy shoes, basketball crosses, ladies' refrigerators and men's balls pick up tats on the parquet floor and quickly find them.
Two-three-four.
Only after that will the voices of the singers grow slowly -- Alt, bass, tenor and soprano -- they come up, charm and follow each other.
And Fitz Hopf, a 29-year-old driver, doesn't jump out of his motherly shoes when he drives them with flexible and expressive gestures.
On Monday evening, the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberge Choir Imbongi repeats a new song.
Fifty participants from 23 to 69 years of age, from human genetic experts to the court.
"Om "Obani" is a simple thing, every voice of people has its own text, as well as in a completely foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Self - Help
According to the United Nations AIDS Programme, the world has some 34 million HIV-infected people.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245,000 AIDS orphans live.
More than 40 per cent of the population are HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Estiheni, the Association of Voices for Africa found heads in Germany.
70 of them attend a school that prepares for further training.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take the lead.
It guarantees the child money for school, school form and daily hot lunch in the Goo-Centre.
Imbonggi in Zulu means a storyteller or an admirer.
There's no running around in this room, so they can sing.
Almost ten years of chorus explores songs in this foreign soft language and from time to time brings them back to where they first appeared: South Africa.
It is 8733 km from Heidelberg, in the north-west of Swaziland, the village of Estzeni, which depends on the voices of the German people.
Forty per cent infected
There are about 2,000 people, some of whom are still living in the plains of clay and straw, among the inhabitants of many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died of the IH virus.
The highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest expected life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF, is the highest in Asia.
The cutoff of male limbs, which is proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, has almost not been accepted among the population.
More than forty per cent of the population in Swaziland have a virus of immunodeficiency, death in the middle of the fourth decade is not rare.
Hor opened this village on a joint trip to Africa in spring 2005, but before that, Imbogni saw a number of children on the streets who were not only concerned about parental care, but also simply: food, clothing, education.
Without school education, people in a poor country have no chance at all.
It was initially a private obligation of individual participants - for a few euros a year to send the child to school and give him an opportunity to get hot food once a day.
But a year later, Choir founded a "Voices for Africa" which has since been professionally concerned about AIDS orphans in Estonia.
Facts of sexually transmitted infections
What are the major sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial PPPs include syphilis, chlamydiaz and tripper (gonorrhea).
HIV, Human Papilloma Virus, Genital Herpes and Hepatitis are common viruses.
Lobby pedicules and garlic are part of the parasitic RIP.
What are the main targeted groups?
Syphilis and honorary encounters mainly with men who engage in sex with men.
The Robert Koha Institute is based on the fact that at least four of the five cases of syphilis registered in Germany are reported as a result of sexual relations between men.
Heterogeneous adults often experience sexually transmitted diseases such as Chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (frequent), honorary and human papilloma virus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of the new HIV infections are present in this group.
Chlamydia infections among young people are much more common than among other groups of the population.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections are reported to have affected young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
We also have a human papilloma virus among young people.
How has the number of cases of infection changed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory registration.
Syphilis disease, according to Robert Koh Institute, has more than doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
It's about a tenth less than last year.
What symptoms suggest a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause genital damage, wet discharge complaints, redness, lowering of the body, and mucous membranes or emulsion.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain undetected.
How can we protect ourselves?
Preservatives can reduce the risk of infection but do not provide a percentage protection.
For partially transmitted sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread through contact infection and with close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend a regular survey, especially when sexual partners are frequently changed.
Early diagnosis can cure the majority of WFPs and avoid remote consequences.
Chiefs, donations, and not least the fees for people's speeches throughout Germany, make it possible to collect something.
"We have already sent about 200,000 euros to Estonia," said Annete Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village itself, money from Germany is available to the Codwa Dlamina, a conscious and active woman.
She also takes care of the welfare of the orphans, such as one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as they call Zulu's old women, is the village's resistance.
Some of them took up to 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and took care of their children in the form every day.
Those who have not yet had a family come to the home of Hanisil, a single woman who receives a payout from the union, as well as two meals that each day prepare for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, the "Voices for Africa" association organized a Swiss school, built two smokers and, in conjunction with the American PSI Health Organization, organized an HIV analysis for many residents of the village.
It's hard to imagine, but the disease, which is so obvious throughout the country, prefers to be deeply silent.
King with 14 women
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it relates to sexuality."
It is quite unusual for a country in which the king has 14 women.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswat III, is known for his love of desertification.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, the lifestyle of such an authorized State is also responsible for the spread of the IC virus so rapidly over the past years.
But it's also on the shipyard workers who spread the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they're almost out of use.
Another culture is the flesh to the flesh."
In order to support a little cultural exchange, Ibmogni Choir every two to three years travels south of Africa and sings songs, full breasts, war spirit, confidence and black self-awareness, which many on the south side of the Black continent have known since the time of apartheid.
A bus full of white people who sing in black - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but has even caused tears to the eyes of heavy frontiers.
The trip is always done in Estonia, where singers visit undershepherds.
Although a small village with difficulty can be found on the map, it is more known in the Eculven Valley.
"Go to Estonia, there's the light," people say.
And after a 8733-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, when the warm-up singers return to the Reception Hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is also burning here.
Messenger: NASA opens ice on Mercury
"Messenger" Zond found evidence that Mercury has ice.
The ice cover may have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The United States Space Agency of NASA has proved that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
Although located close to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as shown in the three studies published in the special journal Science on Thursday.
The "Messenger" Zond has found evidence that the ever-increasing region of the planet will be covered by ice.
Its thickness shall be at least 30 centimeters and possibly up to 20 metres.
It is likely that the water comes from comets or perhaps the asteroids that encountered Mercuria.
No one connects the opening of ice with the existence of life on the planet, says Science Director Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these openings could help explain how water and other building elements of life have fallen into other locations of the solar system.
For the inhabitants of the Earth, there is no record of the wisdom, telescopes and small robots, such as Phoenix, which are studying the depths of the Universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: small cages in endless domes.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Plank Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the Carlic Planet of Cerra.
Like Pluto, which is around the Sun for Neptune, Cerera, as a new definition of the international astronomical union since 2006, is not “planned”.
This fragment of the infrared photo of the Telescope Spitzer represents a family portrait of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in blue dots, more difficult to identify in a star circle the pink "born" stars.
This region of star formation - scientists call it W5 unromantically - open telescope "Spitzer" in the constellation Cassiope, over 6500 light years.
This passing flame of dying star was photographed by NASA's Spitzer Telescope.
It looks like a ring is made up of material that the star emitted in the process of dying.
In the vast fog of Trifid, at 5,400 light-years away from Earth, new stars and dust emerge.
NASA Telescope "Spitzer" took this photo of the Galactic Birth Hall.
The constellation Pleiade, also called the Seven Sister, can be seen by an unarmed eye at night.
Of course, the color telescope gets better.
As a red eye, the observatory's fog on the infrared picture.
It is located at the distance of 700 light years in the constellations of Water.
The similarities with the Earth's continent have brought this fog to North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photos provides expressive colouring.
This new star in all beauty was photographed only with the help of the Spitzer telescope's infrared sensors.
Saturn and his ring: How did they come up is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
It's probably Saturn's moons, which suddenly disappeared 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and clearest pictures of the Hubble telescope: the Waterworth galaxy
Depending on the colouring of the pictures of the spiral galaxies, they are transformed into the present works of art.
The European Southern Observatory shows the darkness of Trifid in the constellation of the Arrow for several thousand light years.
The name Trifid is derived from the Latin word trifidus (triangular, triangular), since the dark poles divide the dust into three parts of the broken heart of the star.
In the constellation of the Star, astronomers photographed a space collision: at the distance of 400 million light-years from the Earth, the nucleus of the two interlocking galaxies is visible to each other, and it is inevitable that they will meet.
This was the birth of the Hubble telescope in the M83 spiral galaxy.
A person who does not like technical reductions may call it the Southern Crowd.
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows the fragment of Iris' ignorance in Cefe's constellation.
Darkness, which has been removed for 1,400 light years, consists of dust particles, ranging from 10 to 100 times the size of normal household dust.
This image was composed of optical and x-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, which is 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 photographed the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The largest spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
There is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The star bell keeps creating new stars.
This starry cloud associated with Rosetka's darkness is also constantly creating new stars - over 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this bright glowing galaxy with a small black hole, only gas is not drunk.
Researchers suggest that it occurred shortly before the Great Exploitation when there was mainly hydrogen in the universe.
Our Opinions in the Universe: Key Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented by Hans Lippersgeem in 1608, even before Galileo began watching the stars a year later.
From that time on, optical telescopes have become more and more accessible to their view of space.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in the Palomar observatory under San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror shown here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Big Binocular Telescope was set up.
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
"Gran Telescopio Canarias" has a giant internal device - a single mirror diameter of 10.4 metres.
The Great South African Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to reduce its value.
However, it reaches about 11 meters in diameter.
Lack of low-cost constructive performance: the telescope is firmly anchored below the vertical angle, which limits its movement.
The Hobby Eberley Telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its speciality: high light-collection capacity.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the largest world telescopes.
Radiotelescope in Aresibo (Puerto-Rico) enables researchers to listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.
Radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
By participating in the "Exterior Mind Search" project (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing his computing power.
Type of European Astronomical Service (ESO) observatory in Chilean Andean.
There's "The Big Telescope" here, which is entirely in line with its name.
Its four mirrors allow the visible tube to illuminate even the average infrared spectrum.
The Chilean ESO Observatory also plans to establish a European Large Telescope Assessment.
Its main mirror must be broken down by 42 metres and will consist of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, photographs should be expected not before 2018.
By 2007, both Kek telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano, Mauna Kea, were considered the world's largest.
They have two mirrors of ten meters in diameter.
The Kek Telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory, which is also viewed in the sky with the help of the Subaru telescopes and the IRTTF.
In addition, there must be a new giant telescope on Mauna Kea, with a mirror of 30 meters.
Here they can fall in love with the illustration.
However, the most important species in space is provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, it has provided pictures of far-reaching worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for planets outside the solar system, especially those on which life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1235 candidate planets had been detected since the beginning of the mission.
The photos feature the latest preparations of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webba Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to space not before 2018 on board the Arian 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the Great Explosion in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists assume that Mercury has ice on the southern shelf.
However, there is no reliable data on this, since "Messenger" is heading closer to the North Pole of the planet.
Radar measurements over decades indicated that there is ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the wisdom "Messenger" launched in 2004, the first to come back to Mercury, scientists are now convinced of this.
Drink oil every day - and live for 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a more Biblical age of respect.
There's even a museum of longevity here.
Looking for a reflection in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a more Biblical age of respect.
There's even a museum of longevity here.
Looking for a reflection in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
A trip through the Tales Mountains can be called a wild and romantic trip.
The minibus with its thunders prowl on the steep road beyond the dense woods of hills, stormy lakes and simple cretian houses.
It's so green and it's bright to think you're in Schwarzwalde.
But it's the southernmost border of Azerbaijan, and the Iranian border is only a few kilometers away.
The people of the towns live here, one of the people of the Caucasians, who have little knowledge, is it only that they speak beautifully in the Persians and Azerbaijani, and they are different in age?
The final item is Leric.
The small town boasts too heavy an architecture of Soviet times, which does not at all harmonize with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe are hardly coming here, the road from Azerbaijan's capital Baku is too tired.
It's eight hours away at 323 kilometers, because the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to the Caspian Sea is here in the province until it has reached.
However, Pilate Fatulaev (48) is convinced that there is nothing to interest tourists in Lelica.
"In May Baku was celebrated by the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world," said Fatulaeva.
She's the director of a long museum, probably the only one in the world.
The biographies are documented here, about eight dozen of these places, with over 100 years of age. Fatulaeva points to black and white photography.
That's my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
At 136 years of age, he had another child
But the controversial museum is the Shirali Muslim chapan, which was reportedly 168 years old.
The birth certificate, however, is not.
And given that the older person, whose age has been confirmed by the documents, is 122 years old, Muslim age seems to be extremely questionable.
"He was born in 1805, died in 1973," explains Fatulaeva.
The man had been married three times, and he had 23 children, and at the age of 136, he reportedly had a daughter.
That's how the Muslim chaplain added a few decades to his age?
Even Rembrandt Shollz, an elderly researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostok, heard of debtors in Central Asia.
"In some areas of China, Japan or the Gulf of Hunza in Pakistan, many of the elderly can also meet," says Sholz, "a very, very old person lives in Sardinia".
However, because of the lack of documents, it is impossible to confirm age because there were no civil registers.
Each day a bottle of hot oil
Nevertheless, the fact is that people in the area of Lereica are often in their best spiritual condition.
Now 20 people over 100 years of age live here.
Why here, in the south, so many debtors?
The Azerbaijani Farid Mugimzade tour guide explains this by a special talisman genes.
The director of the Fatulaeva Museum, on the other hand, believes that it's a matter of food.
The fats love meat, bread and the most milky products, many of them drink on a hot oil bottle every day, but hardly such a high-calorie diet can be healthy from a diet perspective.
Or is it in the early life that keeps people young? In Chengeming, a fragile village close to the city of Leric, Rubab Mirzoeva lives.
At 97 years of age, she was still relatively young for these ranges.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasian region.
She's sitting in the middle with a bottle of oil, which she's standing right there.
There are eight men living under one roof, including one of the sons and the daughter of Mirzaev, who have long had their grandsons.
Two little ones will jump in the vicinity too.
In the kitchen, guests are prepared for tea, which is supplied in typical fried glass of Armouda.
In Mirza's ideally flat and strong white teeth, under the main plate, she avoids the long dark-haired hairs that her son proudly exposes before us.
I'm always my hair with milk, so they've never come out and kept the color.
"And I've never used shampoo," says Mirzaeva.
The monthly pension is enough for life
She always ate just what grew up in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, grapes.
For the rest of my life, I never bought a product at a store.
Then she tells about her husband who served in the army.
The hardest was after World War II.
But it's better when Geedar Aliev's "loving father" got in the role.
Propaganda does not often sound like an old woman.
However, the culture established around the father of the nation, which ruled by the country as dictator, in Azerbaijan is virtually unknown.
He was in power before 2003, and then his son Ilham was taken by the government.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among Azerbaijani elders.
Mirzaeva receives 230 manats (approximately the same amount of euro) as a monthly pension, for local conditions it is the amount to which you can live well.
And perhaps the long-standing son of Mirza's right: "The old people in our culture enjoy deep respect."
They live in a large family of loved ones, surrounded by caring and happy people.
No reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word “human rights” is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Contestant demonstrations in Cairo show a deep gap in the country.
The future Shariate-based constitution has met with fierce resistance.
The Egyptian President has not been bought for Paphos.
We need to create a transition.
"And his success is my responsibility before the people and before the God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but primarily to Christian graves, liberals, educated Muslims and nonreligious Egyptians.
Indeed, all of them, who have thus far been in despair, are fearful of the consequences of their opposition.
Fear of the religious State in Nile for the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brothers.
Mohammed Mursey, if you don't apologize, said he temporarily cut the constitutional court's jurisdiction and expanded his jurisdiction to "save the revolution."
However, the fact is that the 61-year-old engineer, who is a doctor at the University of South California, does not really want to save the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be powerless?
In fact, article 234 was able to pass through a 15-hour walk at night with obstacles to the Islamic constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this was partly a threat.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the caselaw is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and remains the case for interpretation, and it could be feared that Islamists would use a loose language and the resulting legal wave for a more strict interpretation of the Sharia.
At the very least, this is the subject of one new article: in all cases relating to Sharia, the Al-Ashar University Council, the most important Islamic institution of the country, which enjoys great authority in all Sunni Islam.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy oversee legislation, that de facto would result in a limitation of the judiciary.
Much in the draft constitution is the subject of interpretation
Another problem: Civilians must remain subject to the military court.
These courts, during the period of the Mubaraka power, served to suppress the opposition.
As a result, up to 11,000 civilians were in military detention.
Also, as stated in the draft, the State must protect “the true nature of the Egyptian family” and “maintain its morality and values”.
Legally, this is so unclear that public institutions can control even the content of films and literature through this article.
Open text means nothing more than censorship.
In fact, no article establishes direct equality between men and women.
Therefore the other did not harm him, nor did the Noble Messengers.
But what such insults and how they should be punished remains unclear.
It is also doubtful that it is prohibited to "hate people".
Is it enough for the president to have cartoons or jokes about the law?
The question of interpretation, as well as many in this project, which Morsi proposes for signature and which, in his words, will be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"Revolution has returned"
A few weeks have passed since opposition to the superiority of Islamists was formed.
Tens of thousands gathered in extraordinary unanimity on Friday evening at Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document even before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took the third place in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Authority, Mohammed El-Baradei, said that the draft constitution was “in a waste of history”.
Because of the short news service Twitter he accused Mursy's undertakers of wanting to lead the "road against democracy".
"If he announces a referendum, we'll go to his palace and take it off," said opposition Jasser Said.
"We haven't stood up yet, our brothers' blood has not yet been avenged," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition policy of Khaled Ali.
Many judges have also reported that they do not want to observe the referendum, which would render it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized "Muslim Brothers", in turn, called for a counter-demonstration, but, out of caution, not in Tahrir Square, but after the mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile before the University of Cairo.
It was attended by a large number of women under the roofs and the commitments of the Salafites who cried out: “The people require the application of God’s law.”
They demanded Mursi, "Clean the country," and they swore, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic place in which it all began caused the state of practically civil war.
The Morsi followers obviously didn't want to take that risk.
The Muslim brothers said that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had spoken out loud and clear.
Now is the time to allow the people to decide in the electoral order where the country should go.
Most of the Islamic project is considered to be the case.
"Human rights are never mentioned"
Hafiz Abu Saeda was angry with this forced constitutional process, which had to last until February with all the public forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (ODA) protected the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison at Mubaraka or presented to the court.
Not because he divided their views, but because human rights are inseparable for him.
That's why he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" are never found in a new constitution, he regrets in a conversation with "Welt am Sonntag".
The expansion of Mursy's influence on all three branches of government in the State disappoints a lawyer.
These measures are a clear blow to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civilian state, the President de facto cancelled it," regrets Saeda.
For democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even an international community that looks at the ideological struggle of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could be a payout.
A protestor on Tahrir Square warns: "You're creating a monster you can't control."
Norway’s Cancer: the most foolish fish in the world?
Norway's five million people have one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but in the world as well.
Could the secret of the country's success be something of a local passion for an extremely evil fishing industry?
Take a couple of round cheese pieces.
Put them in a dirty and sweaty sports outfit.
Leave them there for a week.
You're going to get the wrong smell of cancer -- one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
It's very beautiful, but in the air, there's an inexhaustible characteristic smell.
Racfisk is a pool of salt-salted and water-smelling water before the year, depending on what the soul needs to achieve.
As the sombers get cold, the Norwegian crowds gather at the Fagernes festival, which is about itself, let's say it's a fascinating event.
"They eat raw and drink water, local water," explains Harvard Halwarsen, a local fire department, and a "racfisc general", who runs the festival.
People all around us eat small pieces of fish and drink it with small portions of alcohol.
"Someone likes more aquavit than a crab," says Harvard.
This drink can break the scent.
I'll try a couple of pieces.
If you can carry a piece under your nose, it's not so bad - it's a little different from the dry portion you've been driving on the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from a totally different time, a time of poverty, when, before the colds came up, the fish was stuck in hermetically closed bottles with salt water.
Then a deep winter, when the fish had been well and well fed, had been pulled out and, as a result, had been swallowed up by alcohol.
Even in memory of the past generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and to migrate mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13 per cent of the immigrants, who are brought here by jobs, high wages and an advanced social security system.
The people of Sweden (the former rival, and not so long ago and much more congested) come here to work.
Racfisk is perceived as an important symbol, constant, even a few evil elements of previous Norway.
It's one of the most expensive local sights.
On the other hand, there will be 9 pounds (U.S.) worth of beer or sandwich.
Norway rarely appears in the world news, and most of the country ' s inhabitants seem to have it.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name Anders Bravik, the right-wing racist and extremist, last year who shot and killed 77 men, women and children.
Not to mention his name, the act is called "the 22 July".
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peace-loving country, one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and killings.
Norway's growth (from the beginning of the 1970s) is one of the world's largest oil-gas industries.
"The same oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our officer, who has a variety of long-haired cancers, a woman with long-haired bright hair and striking blue eyes, including the Nordic welfare.
We are a people like you.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English beautifully.
We don't like showing up, we're not flattering.
Norway is very careful about its oil - most of the oil industry ' s revenues are invested in a special fund established for future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when all the money they had not had, Norway carefully accounted for all the costs.
"As long as you can swim on the winter slopes and walk in the summer, that's enough for luck," Anna says.
"And there's cancer," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm sitting in the snow in the middle of something to eat, and I'm tired of the cancer.
Here's a hamburger with salmon meat, it's just exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening, we expect even more of the same kind of fish with unforgettable smell.
In my hotel there is a special meal about a crab, during which visitors vote to determine the best or perhaps the most aromatic fish.
There's a direct TV showing the lead in the Grandfather's Galshoke, surrounded by Raphais.
It looks like a song contest "Eurovision".
"So, Tor Jurgen, how did you rate the best fish there in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our assessment."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone's falling off a chair, maybe taking over the aquarium.
Maybe just by blowing the scent of that fish.
Mexico President Enrique Peña Njote is facing a challenging career start.
While the newly elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Njote, is preparing to enter the post, the correspondent, BBC Will Grant, invites us to look at the challenges he will face and the mixed expectations of his country's people.
The road movement in Mexico is now particularly in a crying state.
The city was overloaded by transport and in good time, and from Monday, steel fences were built that cut several key highways into the capital and caused chaos on the roads.
However, this was not done in order to prevent people from getting to work from the awards, but to prevent protestors from falling into Parliament's building.
On Sunday, a new head of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will make a presidential transfer and accept the ill will of the country.
He's facing a challenge.
Mexico has achieved good economic performances with Felipe Calderon, which is now in office, but the country has engaged in a war on drugs, which has already taken about 60,000 lives in six years.
"My Government declares to the people of Mexico that it is ready to fight violence," Mr. Penje Něte reported earlier this week to the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama, in the Oval Office of the White House.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal.
Prior to such statements by the President of the United States, Mr. Penja Nyeto had developed a political career as governor of his native state, Mexico.
In his family, in a densely populated and extensive state surrounding the capital of the country, the views of the new leader were divided.
A straight-line man
In the idyllic town of Vale de Bravo, for example, they remember him with warmth.
The residents deserve a revitalization of tourism, the development of the resort and the creation of infrastructure.
You can reach the city on one of the new roads built by Mr. Penjena Nyeto, which are markedly different from the roads with excavated and muds that were previously in the area.
Tables with its name depend on the modern building of the sports centre and on an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We link with him hopes for real and serious changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olver Ernandes, State Congressman of the Head of the New Institution-Revolution Party (PRI).
We expect the current and decisive changes that our country so urgently needs, especially in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous stay of the PRI party, Visente Fox was expelled in 2000.
Congressman Olver acknowledged that after his 12-year absence in the presidential court of Los Pinos, the party had high hopes for Enrique Peña Nyeto.
He also refuted the accusations of insanity that had brought opposition to the new president.
He is very direct and very committed to the integration of his vision of the future country.
He is an excellent public figure, and above all, a man who can listen.
But in the second part of the state, many people had a different idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nesaualkoitl, also known as Ciudad Nes, is the most striking contrast with the mighty streets of Vale de Bravo.
Hidden under the roads, it is, in many ways, the home of Mexico itself.
And problems in the municipality are also severe in this megapolis.
Earlier this year, troops were involved in arming drug trafficking groups in these areas; violence against women was particularly acute here.
A few dozen bodies of women killed were found in the desert near the extensive dump in the last two years.
More than a thousand women have been killed in Mexico during the reign of Mr. Penjna Nyeto, which is much greater than that in the tragic violence of the city of Ciudad-Huares, whose name has become an insult when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to opponents, Mr. Peña Nieto, he was best placed to say that he had failed to deal with the murder of women while he was in the Governor ' s office.
In the worst case, his administration was accused of ignoring the problem completely.
The people of a concrete house, like most of the houses in the surrounding area, Irina Bundiya is hard to stop, showing me pictures of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
In 2010, Mariana committed suicide.
Her family, however, believed that she had been killed by a firefighter.
"When I got to her house, it was like her body was washed away before," recalls Mrs. Bundy.
There were signs that she was killed, and the body was already on fire.
Mariana's mother is telling the story, and the portrait of her daughter is looking at us from the wall, where he hangs around with a pen, on which only one word is drawn: justice.
That is what they said was rejected by the family.
"The state officials treated me like an old brawl, a lack of peacebreaker.
They want people to believe everything they say and to belittled.
But it's wrong, it's not possible, especially when there are so many violations and shortcomings around it," she says.
With the President's transfer on Saturday, President Pennja Njote will take on an uneasy responsibility with her.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violence, and the new President has promised to make this issue a priority during his reign.
"I hope he will be exactly the same president as he was the governor," said Olver, a congressman from Vale de Bravo from the PRI party.
However, that is what the victims' families in Ciudad Nes are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning has not complained of ill-treatment, says the indictment.
Prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning's statements about the poor conditions of detention.
During the hearing, increased attention was given to Manninga's stay in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
Protection requires that the case be closed on the grounds that the terms of Manninga ' s detention were cruel.
The U.S. Army is accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Bradley Manning, who was charged with the biggest leak of classified material in the history of the United States, had not taken advantage of the many opportunities to file a complaint of ill-treatment, which he said had to be transferred to a military prison.
During a cross-examination at the pre-trial hearing in Fort-Midde, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Fain said that the weekly visits of Manning to the prison administration for nine months in Quantico, Virginia, did not contain complaints of maltreatment.
A cross-examination of the application for protection of Manning on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were cruel and that he himself had been sufficient punishment was conducted on the following day, after Manning stated that he intended to commit suicide while in custody.
The military intelligence expert, arrested in June 2010, is accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents during the service in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks did not confirm that the source of information was Manning.
During Friday's hearing, Prosecutor Faine and Manning examined the reports that were filled after Manninga's visits to the administration during his visit to Quantico Prison, where he was in strict detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During visits, prison officials asked Manningu questions and recorded his answers.
When prosecutor Faine asked Friday about the reports, Manning acknowledged that he considered the treatment of the prison administration as “exceeding” and the general terms of the sentence as “professionally organized”.
The records under consideration do not contain complaints of maltreatment, although Manninga has been directly asked about its condition, Faine argues.
Manning replied that he had voiced concern about these problems and that his representatives had discussed these problems with him and claimed that they would, but had not fixed it in writing.
"They've recorded "no problems" (after my complaints) but that doesn't mean I didn't raise this topic in a conversation," says Manning.
The military judge, Colonel Deniz Lind, also asked Manninga why he did not complain of mistreating him in January 2011 at a meeting of the commission that had considered suicide intentions, which he had written a few months earlier.
Manning replied that at that meeting, he wanted to get rid of the "trafficking prevention" regime and mitigated the conditions of detention.
Military leaders explained that a restricted detention regime, at a lower level than the surveillance regime to prevent suicide, had been introduced to protect the prisoner and to protect the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I am all right for them to abolish the anti-trafficking regime... to improve my standard of living from my point of view," Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning witnessed his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to a military-martial prison in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that thoughts of suicide had appeared to him in Kuwait, and that he once lost consciousness because of a severe fire.
He explained that psychologically very difficult when you are not told how to participate, and what is happening in the outside world.
"My world complains to Camp-Arifjan base, to the size of my prison," Manning said on Thursday.
- I thought I'd die in this cell."
While in Quantico, Manning, he said, spent most of his time in a small room at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours a day in total loneliness.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, a garment, a shirt, a few items of clothing and glasses.
He says he was trying to move, as sleeping or even simply lying in the middle of the day prohibited the rules.
According to Manning, during his sleep, he had a constant light that penetrated the outside of the camera.
If the guards didn't see him when he was back in bed at night, they would wake him up and force him to turn back.
Advocate Manning made a formal objection to the abuse of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manninga was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about the statement he made on Thursday that after one night he was forced to sleep in his room in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at the morning check.
Manning said he could not cover his clothes during the check.
In answer to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard's orders that he should throw away the clothes that he could cover, but admitted that no one had ordered him to throw it directly.
On Thursday Manning said he was forced to sleep naked last night because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reported to the officer that he could use a rabbit or rabbit to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, according to Manning's testimony, his lower white, elephants and eyes were taken out of the camera.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account what he had had to experience at the time of the detention and would significantly reduce the term of detention if Manning was found guilty by the military court, which should begin his case at the beginning of next year.
The defence stated that it intended to propose that Manningu acknowledge guilt for less serious crimes and other charges as excessive.
Resumption of the hearings is planned for these outcomes, and it is expected that the accused will insist that conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the content of arrests with the most stringent regime.
Among the charges brought by Manningu, the defendant was an assistant, an illegal promotion of Internet disclosure, the transmission of national defence information, and the abduction of public property or documents.
If he is convicted on all the grounds of the indictment, he may be threatened by a life sentence.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of the American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunity to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left because they remind the people of the difficult times in the country.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American origin are breaking up between two cultures.
During my recent trip to Mexico, I traveled on the corridor for the arrivals, got close to the border control area, and stopped at the site.
The signs were indicated in two rows: one for Mexicans, the other for Foreigners.
I've been standing in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and my whole life was called a Mexican.
It's just a conditional title, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and the New York friends call themselves Italians.
Later, I focused on the complex design of "American of Mexican origin".
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's family, there was no need for conditional names or complex structures.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than that of the linguists, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
That's why I got my American passport, and I became in line for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago, when Mexico's newly elected president, Enrique Peña Nyeto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The agenda was typical of the meetings of the presidents of those countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Peña Nyeto was willing to talk about the rise of the Mexican economy, which would enable Mexicans to remain in Mexico now, with the same success, instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to enter into a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and to establish a North American trading block similar to the Euro Union.
In addition, President Peña Njota promised to continue the war against drug addicts in Mexico, but no specific proposals had been made.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is a serious and committed issue of old age.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848 the United States had invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to abandon half of their territory.
But the Mexicans think for centuries, not for minutes, and they see memories of those events all over the world.
It is therefore only up to any U.S. State official to make a plea of criticism on the part of Mexico, in the press and in the elite of the Mexican society, that there are complaints that Americans are affected by the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the Montesuma descendants are filled with war.
Mexico's relations with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican origin living in the United States are the most complex.
Do you want to talk about insults?
That's enough.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities in that country and those who do not have such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin were only for one reason: at some point in their family history, no one - father or grandfather - had been able to realize himself in Mexico and had to go north.
Most of the time, they were Mexicans of a certain type, poor, poor, educated, Christian families.
We're their descendants, and we remember that.
In Mexico, they'll see it differently.
Today, our life is a dream of America, we've learned in good schools and we've built up a good job, but we don't forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and unclear, but we know which country to consider as its own.
United States of America.
We also know that most representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not like us.
We answer the same thing.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats, and they refer to us as the second-class people as the unreal Mexicans.
We don't speak Spanish enough, and our relationship with Mexico is not strong enough.
Our very existence is due to their failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We wouldn't be in a silky mood now, finding a secure life in the United States, but losing our spiritual relationship.
My wife was born in Guadalahara and was legally moving to the United States as a child, and this reminds me that there are certain exercises between these Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin, Mexicans understand their national identity more clearly and it is offensive to Americans of Mexican origin.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes that she belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, many of my well-known Mexican Americans do not feel that they belong to any of them.
We're listening to the Mexican group Los Tigers del Norte, but we love Bruce Springstin.
Getting the best out of two worlds, you're inevitably losing your roots.
We're Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, we're called Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my visit, as our relationships are not sufficiently confused, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want the Americans of Mexican origin to work as ambassadors of Mexico and represent their interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how well to visit it, and could convince political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
Nothing's gonna work out.
Too many attempts in the past.
And given the gap between the rich and the poor, corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not see this country as beautiful.
Excuse me, but get this straight, amigos.
And that's fair.
If a part of the Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States the way they have treated Mexico half a century ago, they will also have to accept that some Americans of Mexican origin are still in the same position as their relatives in Mexico.
Yes, it is.
Please, we're more general than I thought.
Old battles in the New Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas Group could become a fragile foundation for further peace
Can the long - term peace between the Arabs and the Israelis be achieved in the Middle East?
The main round of bloodshed is the conclusion that such hopes are ineffective.
There were ordinary, meaningless disputes about who first began; many buildings were turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians and six Israelis, were killed; the first rockets released from the Gaza Strip in the vicinity of the Israeli capital Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem were dropped.
However, despite the hopelessness of the Israelis and the Palestinians in their eternal conflict, changes have taken place in the Middle East.
This could be different, but the events of the Arab Spring surrounded many of the enduring realities and the Palestinians and the Israelis were unable to stay away from the storm that shook the region.
Their fight may result in even more bloodshed than before.
There are, however, reasons to hope that this deadly dump will come out.
War Without Winners
At first glance, the current situation does not give rise to optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on 21 November, would be carried out, the clashes that took place this week only strengthened the position of the bats on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamic movement Hamas, who came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, said that they had forced Israel to withdraw despite their losses.
Although some group leaders have been destroyed, 1.7 million people have been trapped in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is increasing its popularity in the West Bank of the Jordan River, another Palestinian territory controlled by the now more moderate Fath movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can come to the conclusion that time is working on them.
As the influence of Islamic movements in the Arab world increased, new influential and rich friends appeared in Hamas.
The emerging regional leader of Turkey, who had once been Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, supported Hamas, who followed her example by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic developing States of the Persian Gulf.
Famous supporters of Hamas claim to establish an Islamic half moon around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where hezbollah is led by a military group, to Syria, where more and more pro-Islamic rebellions are under siege by Bashar Assad, and further to Jordan, where the king's allies are threatened by Hamas.
The most significant change in the balance of forces in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood was reinforced with President Muhammad Mursi.
Hosni Mubarak, which was ruled by Egypt for 30 years, was a world dictator who did not pay particular attention to Hamas ' support.
The Muslim brothers, on the contrary, are an organization, much like Hamas, and their leaders are more inclined to populism.
In future diplomatic arrangements, Hamas may become a significant player whose voice will not silence even Israel and America.
At the same time, Israel's hardline supporters will come to the opposite conclusions.
In a military sense, Hamas was engaged.
The Israeli Iron Dome has justified the cost of its creation and has successfully destroyed many of Hamas launched missiles.
Israeli citizens can sleep peacefully, at least for a while.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States remained faithful to its unchanging position; many European countries also blamed Hamas for the beginning of the last round of violence.
Another important factor was Israel ' s economic prosperity, particularly with the Government of Binyamin Netanyahu, who had largely ignored the peace process.
Although approximately 30 Israelis have been killed since 2004, Israel has been able to minimize the problem of terrorists from the Gaza Strip, partly from a wall that is located in the territory of the West Bank of the Jordan, a large part of an unrecognised Palestinian State, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite such illegal acts in the light of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party, as part of the preparations for the 22 January elections, has been joined by even more aggressively-oriented conservatives under the leadership of Abigail Liberman, is very comfortable.
What is the point of creating and giving Palestinians their own state?
If they were to hand over all the power in the West Bank, would they not start the rockets on Israel's side, as their assemblies in the Gaza Strip do?
It would be better to keep them behind the wall and press hard on any attempt to lift their heads.
It is possible that the hardline supporters will win; however, their calculations may be contradicted by the Arab Spring.
While Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries experience not the warmest feelings of Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
The defence part of the Israeli budget is greater than all its Arab neighbours, together.
The deployment of war against the regional superpowers would not help Arab Governments to strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of Egypt's President, Murcy, who worked with Barack Obama on the ceasefire, is a good sign and may mark the beginning of change.
Israel must, at least to a minimum, take into account the long-term impact of its policy.
As democratic change occurs in Arab countries, the deprivation of the right of Palestinians to self-determination is a bomb of slow action, which will blow up early or late in the Israeli-occupied territories, like a bus blasted in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining the foundations of a democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic aspect - the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates these problems.
For blood transfusions carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress Hamas movement, the international community has to pay for increasing dissatisfaction.
Both sides need an external impulse
There remains the only solution that health-care representatives from both sides are constantly calling for, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the education of two States and Israel's substitutes for security.
There remains hope, which is not too pressing in the short term, that the ceasefire will allow other countries to influence the side of the conflict more effectively.
Egypt, which for a long time has decided to cease arms transfers to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, has, as never before, a favourable position to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish State adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the joint use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fath movements.
This would do more to create a Palestinian State than a forthcoming UN vote, which could result in the recognition of the virtual state of Palestine.
President Obama should also play his part in putting Israel on the table.
During his first term, he did not present his own plan for a peaceful settlement.
Upon his return to the White House, he continued to demonstrate his unwillingness to join in on this issue.
It's a catastrophicly short-sighted position.
The United States is vitally interested in the stability of the Middle East.
This is only possible in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australia entered into force a uniformly packaged cigarette law.
Warnings about the harm of smoking and the image of the body parts affected are contrasted with those of the one green cartons, the same for all brand of cigarettes.
The first in the world practice of Australia's single pack of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force by replacing the logo and colouring of different brands with the same color box of depleted olive oil with vivid images of children affected by body parts and images whose health is damaged by their parents' smoking.
In addition to the different pictures and inscriptions warning of the harm of smoking, the only difference between packs introduced in a compulsory manner from this Saturday is the name of the marks printed by the same small font.
These are the harshest conditions in the world for packaging tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the aim of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, thereby depriving them of this harmful habit of fashion.
Such a solution was based on studies that showed that people who did not start smoking at 26 years of age in 99 cases of 100 never become smokers.
“It is obvious that even at the very young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to bring with them by means of packaging,” explains Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, referring to studies that show that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with children with the idea of a princess.
Australia is one of the world's smallest proportions of smokers, so these changes will not be particularly affected by the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering such measures.
The tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market to which cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
"This law will have serious consequences that are different from those that were designed by its initiators," says Scott McKintair, a representative of British American Tobacco company in Australia.
Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will place far more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone, on the contrary, new laws contribute to business growth.
Sandra Ha, from a small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that the demand for oranges and silicone footwear, covering unpleasant pictures on the package, has grown rapidly (in practically zero) since two months ago, such companies as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have been tried in the high court of Australia, where they tried to appeal to this law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already carried out some six thousand products for optical trading companies and is expecting a new party.
It's a good business for us.
The potential for such measures is, in the opinion of the experts, the popularity of social networks among the part of the population to which these measures are addressed.
Following the adoption in Australia of a number of laws that have made and supported illegal television advertising of cigarettes and that prevent sellers from displaying cigarettes in a visible place, tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet.
The Government of Australia has prohibited local companies and websites from posting advertising online, but it cannot limit this foreign website.
"If you trade tobacco products and you only have this little lasaika left, the idea of moving your goods online will prove to be extremely deceptive," explains Becky Freeman, a researcher at the University of Sydney.
The Freeman notes an increase in the number of reviews on trademarks written by people who claim to be ordinary users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises - is this really the case of a number of citizens who love cigarettes so much that they don't regret the strength and the time and make a video, or is the advertising company worth it?
The Australian Office of British American Tobacco claims that the industry is now more involved in adapting to new rules than advertising.
The tobacco industry has even taken measures such as the sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge new rules: these States submit claims under the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been subject to unfair restrictions, despite the fact that trade relations with Australia are very small.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tani Plibersek, the Government had discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada introduced the first mandatory placement of photos to prevent the risk of smoking.
This rule has now been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening the laws is being considered in Britain, New Zealand, the USA and India.
The majority of smokers in Australia have not responded to the news.
These pictures don't bother me.
I'm just not paying attention.
"You're just taking out a cigarette and you're pulling a doll in a carnival," explains Victor El Haeg, who buys a cigarette with a picture of a mouthful on the doll.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me quit is my little daughter.
James Yu, a manufacturer of the King of the Pack tobacco shop in the center of Sydney, claims that the same package has complicated the task of placing the goods in the pool
"I used to have a new party run out of time, and now it's four hours," he complains.
"The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, we would have said, "Well, well, we're done closing the store," he says, throwing his hands up.
Cutting off electronic networks and permanent connections in the world is not so bad.
On that day, thanks to me, I had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had mechanical failure and replaced it with another plane we had been waiting for.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of the boredom.
I'm not going to deceive you.
The afternoon at the airport waiting for the trip is really boring, and there won't be much help here either books, magazines, iPhones or even a free trade store.
However, more and more scientists and child development experts have recently expressed themselves in favour of pregnancy.
They say that in certain situations for us and for our children, it is not so bad.
This causes the brain to drift away from interesting related topics that may contribute to creativity.
And since in today's world we're all standing in front of a screen, the benefits of the boredom are beyond us.
Maybe we should try to get bored?
Yeah.
And there's no time.
We'll get back to it.
Earlier, I, like many others, thought that it was boring to invent relatively recent times when people had more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, author of the book "An Entrance History of Pity" (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, the boredom can be very old-fashioned," he says.
The walls of Pompeii contain Latin inscriptions on the date of the first century.
This remains an open question about how we understand the boredom.
The problem is, says John D. Isud, Deputy Professor of York University in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and the vision of boredom has often changed.
Having studied the research materials on this subject and asked the task force for 100 people, Professor Isidad and his colleagues came to the following definition: boring is when people "want, but cannot do what they would be pleased with".
The difference between fatigue and apathy, he says, is that the bereaved person does not do something that he wants to do.
I don't want to do anything when I'm sick.
He says, chiefly in the boredom, that it is “a violation of attention and the related deterioration of mood and the feeling that time is running out slowly”.
According to the description of pregnancy, it may be very similar to depression.
However, Professor Istud argues that despite the possible link between these conditions, people with disabilities see the causes of problems in the surrounding world and circumstances, and people with depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we find it boring when we're really hard to focus on something.
In his study “Unsatisfied Mind: Determining Deficiency From Attention”, published in the September edition of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Isidad and colleagues referred to a previous experiment, whose participants heard a vote reading the magazine.
Some participants also heard loud sounds not related to the telegram in the neighbouring room, others heard the same sounds in low volume, so they could hardly be understood, and the third group only listened to a voice without a side sound.
Those who heard low - noise television noted that they had been bored, more often, and more difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons for this and attributed it to boredom.
When we are trying to concentrate on a difficult or challenging task, the interruption of attention may be boring, says Mark J. Fenske, neurology assistant professor at the University of Gwelf, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we're doing something interesting, "for example, looking at the stream of goods on the conveyor to find a marriage that's distracting music can help to avoid boredom."
He continues that when people start getting up on the table or drawing caracles on the paper list, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that such actions really help not to relax physically.
“The study has shown that children who are not forbidden to go back and forth learn better and remember more information than children who need to sit down,” says Professor Fenske.
At some point, we're all bored: when we're late for the trip (as in my case), listening to a monotonous talk, watching an interesting movie.
However, different people show different degrees of tenderness.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a special “steepness scale” to measure such individual characteristics.
Questions and allegations, for example, are used to determine the scale of assessment, “Many of what I have to do, uniformly and monotonously” or “I’m too interested, so nothing is enough of time”.
With such questionnaires, researchers have found that boys are missing more girls, says Stephen Vodanovic, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when there are various external dissidents.
In general, however, adolescents are often missing out on a regular basis.
In 1991, Rid Larson, a professor of personal and public development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment involving almost 400 adolescents and their parents 7-8 times a day with the help of the pager.
He received the following results: 32 per cent of adolescents said they were bored at school and during homework, and 23 per cent said they were bored outside school.
Only 3 per cent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he does not have any data on what kind of pregnancy is now 21 years later.
However, he knows that “adolescent age has a tendency to be bored”, mainly because children and adolescents are not able to decide what to do with them.
Let's go back to my original question: boring useful?
Sometimes there is no, because in extreme manifestations it, as research shows, can induce people to engage in absurd and dangerous physical activities, risk gambling or abuse of certain substances in an attempt to escape from pregnancy.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have been thinking about the relationship between fatigue and creativity, says Professor Vodanovic, who has devoted more than two decades to studying the problem.
"So our brain tells us that we should do something else; it's boring," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
However, the same brain does not always know what is best for it.
If you're bored and you're making this energy into a guitar or culinary experience, you'll do better.
But if you get to watch TV, you'll get better for a while, and it's going to happen soon.
Therefore, if your child is bored and you give him the iPad, he will stop missing, but he will not learn to fight the fatigue alone or in any other way manage his time and employment, says Professor Fenske.
"And such self-regulation skills are in different situations," he said.
Your child learns not only to take care of himself, he also learns self-control at all.
I don't think it's boring to carry something.
However, it is not worth it either.
You should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Isud agreed to this.
"We see this in such a way that we need to be more bored, while being bored is a very unpleasant, inconvenient desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people are trying to get away from the constant care and just relax.
"In today's world, we've been used to constantly overstimulating emotions," he says, "and when there's silence, we're lost and we don't know what to do."
While it is not clear how a new law on the legalization of marijuana in the State of Colorado will apply
Anthony Orosko, a 19-year-old football team player and a college student in the south-east of Colorado, is accused of committing a criminal offence that will soon be completely legal throughout the state: keeping a small portion of marijuana and the tube in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosko said that once in September he and his friends were in Lamar and drove to a car on the border with Kansas when they were stopped by the police.
After the police found out in the marijuana car, Mr. Orosko came to the drug storage court and had the custom of using drugs - small offences, each of which was charged with a fine of $100 - and the date of the judicial meeting.
"We are being treated like criminals," said Mr. Orosko.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of uncertainty, which has continued for several weeks after the State of Colorado had voted in favour of the legalization of the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small cases is not so much dependent on the law as on the place of consideration.
The allegations of minor marijuana offences have already been reported in hundreds of cases here and in Washington, D.C., which has taken similar action.
Police stations have already stopped indicting people at the age of 21 and older than keeping small doses, which will be considered legal as soon as the law enters into force within a few weeks.
However, in the more conservative districts of Colorado, prosecutors have decided to consider existing cases relating to marijuana and continue to be responsible for the storage of this drug.
At the same time, in some cities, from Denver’s suburbs to the mountains of the West, there is a vote to prevent the emergence of new state-licensed marijuana stores in their places.
"It's all going so fast that I don't even know what to wait for," says Daniel J. Outs, chief of police in the city of Aurora, east of Denver.
The representatives of the governing bodies in Washington, D.C., also honor their heads.
They must lay down rules for the licensing of the growing, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all of this must be done by 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or bad, prevents most other states from resolving marijuana, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
“In Colorado, a more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example,” explains Brian I. Smith, a representative of the Council on the Control of Production and the Sale of Alcohol Products in Washington State.
But now no one can do more, Mr. Smith recognizes than to make some suggestions and hope that it will work.
"We don't have this precedent that we could focus on," he says.
The Washington State Bill, called I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will cast the state into uncertainty throughout the year when the state licensing system is not yet available and the right to possession of marijuana is already legal.
There are still some simple technical aspects that need to be addressed during this period, such as how to strike a balance between the state's "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with the prohibition of trading it at 1,000 feet away from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
“It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana trading companies in a variety of cities, especially in Seattle and its suburbs,” explains Ben Livingston, a representative of the recently established marijuana legalization research group.
On 21 November, the Chief of Police Outs from Aurora sent an e-mail message that the city's prosecutor's office would no longer attract persons aged 21 to the charge of possession of a small number of marijuana and that the police would cease to treat people in these violations as “the beginning of this time”.
The Chief of Police Outs reported that the police would follow the rules in the city governing the activities of marijuana growers for medical purposes and would persecute illegal drug dealers and distributors.
The prosecutor of the Wald District of North Colorado, Ken Bak, represents a more stringent approach to the matter.
After voting on the bill, he stated that the prosecutor ' s office would continue to be responsible for the possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage its users to undergo a treatment course.
At this point, 119 people have been charged with the custody of two or less ounces of marijuana, although many of them have been accused of other violations.
"The obligation of our institution is to pursue actions that are considered to be criminal at the time they are committed," said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The response was even uneven in places such as the village of Mesa, where voters rejected the proposal for the legalization of marijuana.
The Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, no longer hold the juveniles responsible for a small amount of drugs.
The District Prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supported the decision, but also decided not to withdraw the charges on open cases related to the storage of marijuana.
"I believe that to ensure compliance with the law until it changes is our direct duty," he said.
Despite the fact that 55 per cent of the people in the State of Colorado who took part in the vote supported this decision, the inclusion of marijuana in the public and legal system would not be easy.
And the conflicting reaction of the population in different parts of the state has led to the disparity of local authorities in the experiment of the state with marijuana.
“There is a cultural barrier for district prosecutors in this regard,” explains Sean Macalister, a Danish lawyer representing the interests of marijuana offenders, and the local representative of the National Maritime Law Reform Organization.
"They've been chasing people for so long that they can't really calm down now that it's no longer a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states in which marijuana is as small as alcohol, are destined to become a country-wide field of experimentation to verify the very idea of legalizing drugs.
Legalization partners and state officials are planning to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they are demanding instructions from the federal authorities who are still planning to sell and raise marijuana as federal crimes.
Parties to the legalization of marijuana hope that the Office of Justice will address this issue.
Despite a number of large-scale resonance of the arrests of traders and patients using marijuana on medical evidence, the federal government has in most cases made good use of marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Agents of the Drug Control Bureau will hardly be able to go home to confiscate a small package of marijuana, but they will hardly be able to close their eyes on the state-controlled recreational marijuana store, which is permitted under the new law, considers Kevin A. Sabet, a former Drug Advisor in Obama ' s administration.
Some cities in Colorado were not expected to act by the federal authorities.
Prior to the presidential elections, some local administrations approved moratoriums to open new shops for sale of marijuana, which could not be opened earlier than a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, issued a six-month ban on the sale of marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in such a position that we're going to issue a license to someone and then it's going to cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our city voted against the amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still many outstanding issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I was survived from Oxford because I was a conservator.
The persecution of university students for their views has not begun today.
As far as I can remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogous to the ancient symposium that established two foundations of civilization -- freedom and tolerance.
And yet, two weeks later, at the University of Oxford University's historic college at the end of the 80s, I picked up a cacadana and left, which was the first present scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand it and cried.
Friends have been beaten up so much.
The Evening Standard said that I left college because I didn't like my roommates having sex in the next room.
Author E. Norman Wilson was joking that I was leaving, because I had to drink from a cup of tea.
It wasn't really that fun.
I ran away.
Yeah, she ran away because I was being systematically tortured and scared.
Not quite because of my rather unusual name or what I learned in private school.
I was tormented only for one reason, and in this glorious corner of education, it looked like a barbaric and blind fanaticism: my father, now dead Woodro Wyatt, was known as counsellor Margaret Tettcher, and I was himself a supporter of conservatives.
You're gonna ask, why remember that now?
According to recent data, a new generation of students with rights-based views is being subjected to the same scourge.
This institutionalized and ever-increasing hatred for the conservative students in Oxford was so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as that granted to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
The conservatives at the Corpus Christi College in Cambridge say that they are "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and forced to feel unwelcome" because of their political views.
They wish to introduce an additional representative to the Committee on Equal Rights to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation has only exacerbated the recently released BBC 2 documentary on the policy in the student environment “Stern Wonders: Young, Wise and Right” in which the conservatives presented themselves with eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film showed Joe Cook, the former president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association, who rides in the Rolls-Rose, wearing a silver suit and a silver suit.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they are making "nobs because of higher education fees".
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice-President of the Association of Nottingham University Conservatives, said in an interview with one of the resurrected newspapers that “the university environment is increasing the gap towards left-wing views.
People who do not even know us think that we are the ones who are oppressed and without punishment for the children of rich parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of the Corpus Christi College of History, in which a request for protection was made, calls such an atmosphere "unusual", and Stephanie Cheryl, 19, a new president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association, says that the attitude of the students at the club to the rights-based audiences has deteriorated significantly.
"This is a threat both to the intellectual discussion atmosphere and to the normal life of the club," she says.
For the first few weeks in Oxford, I wasn't just in the minority, I was alone.
I went there in September 1986, with a laborer and a stupendous 18 - year - old girl.
Oxford was sick of hate to a conservative party.
A year earlier, the university had given a vote to former student Margaret Tettcher because of a reduction in the budget allocations for higher education.
Even Stalinists would be in such an atmosphere.
On the first day of the first week of the high school, when the students met with each other and with teachers, I first felt what I was waiting for.
I did not yet know that not only did the teachers look through their fingers at the student-conservative grass, but they were delighted to participate in it.
Political issues - the strike of the miners, the privatisation and the Government ' s disagreement to apply sanctions against the Government of the apartheid in the U.A. - have penetrated through covered wooden panels of the auditorium wall.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said the teacher, now late Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
Text gave me a hard time, I stopped.
Harry Pete was a very greedy man with a guy like cake.
"Tatcherists don't teach French in principle or they just don't have enough brains?" he asked.
Other students were killed.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I advise you to take a few basic French lessons in free time, if you're of course not very busy, going back to society," Pete said.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That night at college I sat alone at lunch; then someone grabbed me on my shoulder.
It was James, a second-grad student from the English School, who was presented as a member of the Association of University Conservatives.
"I know who you are," he said friendlyly.
- Unfortunately, the case is as follows:
Anyone who is suspected of being in sympathy with the preservatives will be exposed.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know that your father's close to Margaret Tettcher, so it's gonna be harder for you.
Most first-class conservatives pretend to be Laborists."
Later, in the local pub, I tried hard to hypocrisy.
I insisted on not agreeing with everything Margaret Tettcher says.
The throttle failed.
The principal of the Faculty of Philosophy, Policy and Economy, which he studied in Ethan, said: "You are a daughter of a fascist pig.
You're infected."
Other students took his words.
I was embarrassed, dirty.
"How are the condoms doing sex?" asked one of them.
- They're kissing each other, right?"
I felt that I must have felt homosexuals before the abolition of criminal prosecution in the sixties.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or am I just going to have to meet the nuns at night?
Will I have to become a labyrinth and hide my current beliefs?
The next three years have become hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who did not hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for being a adviser to Tetcher on foreign policy and one of its sponsors.
He almost didn't show up in college.
He despised it for the provinciality, melancholyness and commitment to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997, he took a position as a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started traveling to Oxford from my parents ’ home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unaccompanied capital friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his training in the fortieth years, any political views were adopted there.
"But this is the best university in the world," he lamented.
- They can't do that, but they can't do it in the city of the sleeping caves...
Even my Communist friends always say they're absolutely right."
His wet eyes were blinded.
"Don't make any hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you drop the university."
I've been drained by constant visits to London and by my emotional protection of the weak.
My friend, also a conservator, did not resist pressure and gave up his convictions.
The following week, during a seminar, when the ordinary teacher of history took me seriously as an enemy of the people, I decided to do the same.
In my spirit of shame, I admitted that "I missed my parents' brains," and I called them "old fools."
It was too short.
The last iron in the grave of my career in Oxford was destined to kill my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns each week for Rupert Merdok’s publications.
My door was locked.
I didn't leave, and five minutes later my persecutors surrendered.
When they left, I picked up my suitcase and sat on the first train to London.
I didn't come back.
You can call me a plax and a tramp.
But within eighteen years, no one should be subjected to such abuse and intimidation in the educational institution.
Unfortunately, it was Oxford, who not only issued fourteen prime ministers of the country, but also today is hiding behind the undeserved reputation of a university in which equality and freedom are appreciated.
"Valentino prefers the elegance of glory"
On Valentine's show, which opened this week in London, ABC is interviewing Nati Abaskal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemica and other well-known Italian designer customers
Sommersett House, the former residence of English Queen Elizabeth I, the only place in the British capital to receive a exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized this at the opening of Valentine's Day, a triumphal retrospective exhibition that combines more than 130 high-mode fashion dishes created by his "home" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unrepeated Italian accent.
This exhibition is a final part of the story, the only character of which is "El Sionore" Garavani, but it could not be written without its named customers.
Valentino has always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world.
In the first hall of this exhibition, open before 3 March, personal letters and photographs of the most famous aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga-han to Lord Snoudon, including Mary-Santal, Princess Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as a trophies of his social upsurge: from a modest port from the town of Voger in northern Italy to an international “elita”.
To be loved in the royal court is nothing wrong with that.
"At least they don't throw away their cigarettes on your beautiful envelope, like some beautiful pop music stars do," says Fiona Tyssen-Bornemica.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an unparalleled host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all liked to come to his hall in Gsthaade," explains the ex-wife Hayney Tissen, a close friend of the forgotten beauty of Marella Angelly or Evgenie Niarhos.
Valentino always preferred the elegance of glory.
And yet he's a star.
Valerie Máz, representing Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Maze mentions a charismatic model.
Once we went to dinner at his house, it was after showing fashion in Spain's square in Rome many years ago.
Among the twenty invited were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, the youngest.
Valentine's style was displayed in everything, in every detail of his apartment, in her clothes, in food, in music.
"Each of Valentino's guests felt important and loved," recalls the "top model", whose work with the model began in 1995 during the High Fashion Week in Paris.
"He's never out of fashion, because his sketches are the present works of art," she concludes.
The Parade of the Family
The life of Garavani is not a story of obstinacy but of love with full reciprocity.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Sommerset Houses galleries was turned into a glamour of 60 meters in length, offering a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and is to define on the stage, the gazelle of the "glasses" from the grass, which wears the hats of Valentino, such as the suit chosen by Jacqueline Kennedy for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the suit used by Monica Whitty in Nights, or the coat of breast and skin belonging to the emperor Fara Dibb.
In this audience, there are names such as Sibilla Luxemburg, Gloria von Turn und Taxis, Matte-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Gabsburg.
Nati Abascal and modeler, 2006
Many of these customers say that Valentine's first is like the first love, "it's impossible to forget."
I remember him wonderfully.
These were pants, skirts, "hungry" and jackets from the 1971-1972 autumn collection.
"It was a gift he made to me," says Nati Abbascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I admire him for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the former Duke of Fairy.
I like the color he uses: they have a lot of light and they're going to come to him.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and legislator of the Patricia dill Jovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she was dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and I lived in Italy, I dreamed I'd be age and reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
Finally, that time arrived at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first salary from Valentino to put him on a holiday in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Linh.
It was a red plate, with a pair of dresses, a corsage in the warehouse and a cut without a bra.
"It was a dream that became an appearance," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is the same as fashion, his passion is temporary," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her holiday pay from the model with "maximum caution... because the pay is not just pay, it's also a set of memories that accompany him."
"King" Modes
The great final exhibition in Sommersett-House is the wedding pay for Marie-Shantal Miller for her wedding with Paulos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 “girls” (as called the model of their sewing) to produce this pair of ivory-coloured silk, with an incrustation of gums, twelve species of different circles, and a shelf in four and a half metres.
According to journalist Susie Menques, the highest authority of the specialized press, the pay is a high-end 20th-century fashion, "the return of customers from the highest light".
For many years, the "style of life" of the elite is now Valentino himself as the best representative.
The Knight of the Great Cross (the mark of the highest rank in Italy), the Knight of Labour, the Commander of the Order of Arts and Speech awarded by the Order of the Legion, Garavani collected as much honors as any of his clients' wives.
"I've always drawn my attention to his ingenuity, his calmness, his accurate and unmistakable appearance," recalls Dr. Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was last month at the Orse Museum.
He was sitting at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was useless, time doesn't exist for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The world's most difficult profession: shooters with Kawah-Ijen
Four-euro Indonesian miners risk life and health, weighing 70 kilograms of sulphur at the top of the volcano on steep rock tropics.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are literally working in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of 400 hunters who earns the life of a grain of grain in the Kawah-Ijgen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Each day, Anto descends to the bottom of the crater, where the greenhouse gas rising from the ground stops in contact with the air.
From around the huge pieces of cheese, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, it puts them in two bamboo boxes, pours the basket on its shoulders and carries them up the steep stone road.
Up to the top of the volcano, with a height of 2,386 meters, only 250 metres, but the loaded trucks need more than 40 minutes to get up with a sharp step, with difficulty keeping the balance and carefully pushing the road so that they do not turn back and fall off the cliff.
They know that one false step can stand for them, as it happened to a tourist from France who collapsed several years ago from the Kawah-Ijen rock.
The Kawah-Ijen hunters earn 5 eurocents for every kilogram of cheese they earn
On top, they take the road between the tourists who photograph them as if they were hanging from the circus and, with heavy corsets, they walk three kilometers to the weights that the mining company had heard above, at a height of 1,850 metres.
It is about PT Candi Ngrimbi, an enterprise that has been operating this volcano since 1960 and, better or worse, its workers, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocents) per kilogram of serum.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 eurocents) of petroleum production, as this mineral is distributed in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even sugar.
"As a rule, we make about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for every walk," Anto explains, who usually carries out three daily transfers.
It spends three hours each and finally feels broken, but they allow it to store 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a miser for such an inhuman effort, it is three times more than he would have earned in the field.
" Day-to-day wages for miners are very high on local measures, where 15,000 rupees are paid per day (EUR 1.2) and the average monthly earnings equal to two million rupees (167 rupees) " , explains the truck who previously worked as a stoner on the Bali tourist island.
Its salary was 75,000 rupees per day (EUR 6.2) and the site was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banjuvangi, a town not far from the volcano, for a major reason that in Indonesia is as devastating as the cheese: "I married a girl with Bali, where some Hindus, and brought her to Java to accept Islam."
Anto asthma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and he's got eyes coming down because of toxic gases.
At 27 years of age, Anto spent three years risking himself in Kawah-Ijhen, whose cheese has already begun to affect him despite the presence of masks and special points.
He's got asthma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and he's got eyes coming down because of the toxic gases that release the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for his dream.
"I am working for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
The young man who was punished for his life could be a tourist guide, an officer, or a guest in the hotel, but instead he was doing the work of the mule.
Among the dirty wooden cabins with other carriers, it rises every day at two o'clock in the night, because the cheese does not stop running at night when its distinctive yellow color becomes blue and shines in the dark.
A lot of challenges to the tents, Anto descends into the crater, exposing himself to a small fan attached to his helmet, which he himself bought for his own money.
Approximately 400 wearers rubbing boxes with serum on their shoulders with the bottom of the volcano
Despite high incomes, the mining company did not mechanize the production of cheese for cost savings and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their own and with such deprivations.
In fact, they do not receive even a portion of 30,000 rupees (EUR.5) of the photo collection, which, along with the private ticket of 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.2), is taken from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its people.
"This work for cattle, not for humans," says Badrusin, a 42-year-old Korean carrier who spent three decades in Kawah-Ijen, since he left college.
He is able to raise up to 110 pounds, he assures that he will endure the work “as much as he can” because he needs money to raise his three children from 18 to 10 years of age.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the serum burns the throat and warms the eye, when the wind suddenly changes and catches the shafts in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so excruciating that no one complains about their severe diseases... more serious, evidently than their usual problems with breathing, arthrosis, knee pain and sores on their shoulders that have deformed under the weight of the corsin.
By balancing the basket on the back, Uninik can now only raise 50 pounds in his 53 years.
Every day, he and his companions produce 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to a warehouse in Tamansari, a distance of 18 kilometres per narrow drop of growth.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, because the volcano is my whole life," says Uninik, wide opening her mouth, with a few teeth missing.
Of his five children, aged 30, he also works as a serum carrier.
Time is passing, but poverty continues to be one of the most difficult occupations in the world from generation to generation: what human mules are doing with Kawah-Ijen.
Singapore seeks children to save the economy
Singaporens accuse of careers, stress and prices of housing and education in the absence of children.
"Singapore population needs growth."
I'm a patriot husband, you're my patriot wife, I'll fulfill our civil debt and we'll create life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising of artificial beads, but despite this - or possibly because of this - this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore early this year.
These phrases are part of the tail that uses local proverbs like "Let's put the bao (bun) in the oven" to smile at the level of birth in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, is hoping that they will be able to draw attention to this problem in an entertaining way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to enable people to carry out their "national debt".
This thing was exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's a major problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt that it was the subject that we had to touch.
We knew that the Government was trying to do a lot of things, for example, to start ghosts with pheromones or to organize fast dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely, create a rap?
1.2 Children
Whoever doesn't understand this so easily, it's the Government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The public package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 for the child, extends maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and highly technological city in South-East Asia, also known as the conservative of its leadership and its strict public control.
The level of fertility in Singapore, according to its national population management, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was below 2 is known as a percentage of the replacement in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wey Min, Director of the Policy Office for Spouse Couples and Families of the National Population Management, said that the reason for “improvement of education” and “a wider range of career opportunities”.
"This has enabled people to have a wider range of options for living goals and priorities, besides weddings and family creation," she explains.
These social changes have contributed to the growth of the number of holocausts and to the deferral of marriages and births of children, resulting in a decline in fertility in Singapore.
However, immigration policy, which aims at a sharp increase in immigration to prevent population decline, is a source of disparity among the local population.
Singapore has web sites where the barely hidden xenophobia of many new immigrants, particularly Chinese people, is being criticized for keeping wages at a low level and unwilling to integrate.
The growth of immigration is also seen as one of the reasons for Singapore ' s ruling party last year ' s worst result in independence elections.
After the elections, an attempt was made to address the problem, with quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected effects
While the decline in fertility has a well-known impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, health and immigration policy, the example of Singapore has also begun to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government is working hard not to build such a small house.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The City Development Guide has been able to control the number of small apartments known as the "slip box" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments of 46 square meters are very well sold.
Nevertheless, there is a view that they can contribute to a hilarious life - style and are losing the incentives of device owners who want to build a large family home.
But Lim Yu Sunj, CEO of the EL Developers home construction company, says that their shoe boxes are sold much faster than more spatial copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are purchased for a few days, even a week, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our income is increasing.
However, he acknowledged that the new rules provided clearer guidelines for devices that had previously been put in brackets if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Overloaded
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporens working in the financial district of the centre, they do not seem to have any special effect.
"People are very stressed, expensive housing, as well as education, and that's why many people are putting it off," says a young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But it is important for me to have my own money and time," another young man said 20 years ago.
Men and women refer to their careers, stress and housing prices and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, as if the Government were not trying to encourage its citizens to have children, with regard to the birth of children, the last word remains for Singapore.
Personal in offline - personal online
Confidentiality.
According to the King's Academy of Spanish, it is a private or “personal life that has the right to protect against any interference”.
What is personal for a minor under 16 years of age?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and in social networks?
Does he understand the dangers posed by Internet discussions that are unlikely to be shared outside the Internet?
ElPeriodico interviewed five boys between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent network users.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", in the personal plane, and "the password and the name of the user", when they applied it to social networks.
"My biggest secrets I wouldn't download," says ten-year-old Jorge, when he's trying to explain the importance of personal on such sites as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has records for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not the whole world," he says.
I'm loading beautiful pictures or pictures of the game on the FB.
I'm also having fun with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photograph that's not mine, or someone who's acting stupid," he says.
The boy realizes that it is wrong to publish inappropriate photos of the oppressed, the crimes or to write insulting or angry comments.
Jorge believes he knows 35 friends he has in the FB, and nine of his Facebooks on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Mother, she has a password for one of the records.
I put on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just charge them," he adds.
"Social networks are entertainment, I can talk to distant relatives or friends in a hurry," he says.
Without thinking, he answers that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
It would not be considered to be someone who recommended it to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
The adolescent has open records on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and recently admits that he does not know 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one entered his trust and did not ask for his home address or phone number.
"If I get pushed or demanded, I'll just remove them from my records," he admits.
José became a successor to Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
A boy is not a stranger to the experience of being known today as a cyberbing.
One of my friends was blackmailed on the social network.
He was threatened and demanded money.
"He didn't know who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim did not delete the record.
"He's only involved in confidentiality."
It then explains the sequence of steps to set a record safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would have taken pictures of the acquaintances in uncomfortable or confusing situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I don't like people or if I want to.
"Here I know it's a cyberbing," he confirms.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and teacher in education and education, believes that in order to send children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that social networks are intended to be informed.
"The Internet has appeared as a means to find information, but the rules of the game have changed with the presence of these sites," she notes.
Porras points out that academic Mark Prensky, a professor of education at the Yel University and the author of work The Digital Aboriginals and Immigrants invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aboriginals are those, children and young people born in the age of technology.
"We are digital immigrants who have to teach them while we're still learning," she says.
It explains that this topic is complex, “because we ask them to have a certain criterion for what can or cannot be disseminated, published or spoken when maturity is not sufficient to do so”.
"So that they are elected, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show that such confidentiality to children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
"Tell them not to do this is useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell the stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or would you like to be photographed by the kind of person you've published about your friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you sign photos of dinner, do you ask permission for other people to notice them?
And yet, does everyone need to know what you're doing at any time?
Another point is to let them understand that they have to go online just as they do offline.
The rules are the same.
"On the Internet, a person conducts himself with respect, responsibility and other principles, as must be on social networks," she said.
Drainage
Estuardo Guardia, a university teacher, a professor of primary education and an education consultant, explains the need for family heads to read social networking policies in good faith.
Understanding each item, they have good grounds for talking to children about the requirements for opening an Internet account.
"For example, age and what is allowed to distribute or publish," he said.
According to Gaurdia, the key question is to remind children not to speak to strangers.
UNASUR Summit ends without the announcement of the Lima Declaration
VI The Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) was concluded today in Peru without the announcement of the Lima Declaration, previously declared and theoretically signed by binding participants.
The effect has been repeatedly sought to obtain access to a document signed at the VI regular assembly of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the President ' s Administration indicated on the main page that it would be transmitted after the closure, but then confirmed that it would be published on the Peruvian Government website at a certain time.
On the text, they pointed out that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Olianta Umala, during short press statements.
The access of journalists to information on the Summit has been limited at all times.
During the day, only the video of the Presidential Assembly was broadcast in the press room without a sound with a "closed meeting, a sound forbidden".
A small amount of information circulated among reporters was transmitted by the press secretaries of some UNASUR Governments attending the meeting but not Peruvian.
The only paper distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, causing the dissatisfaction of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, who requested more information.
Subsequently, the administration of President Peru sent an electronic message to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but it was Umalya’s statement, not the official document that had been completed.
Last October, Peru adopted the IIIth South American and Arab Summit (ASPA), and the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier, was not distributed, despite its insistent demand for press.
The official ASPA website can be verified that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure that transmission systems for all journalists were provided, but they were limited to obtaining information.
The Summit was also concluded by a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt the Hague Court of Justice, which regulates the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Olianta Umala and Chile, Sebastian Pinner, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they would comply with the decision of the International Court of Justice, which began hearing the statements of both parties in The Hague on Monday, in the context of the indictment that Lima had brought against Santiago.
"We will respect and enforce a decision that will clarify the differences that we are currently submitting to this international court," Umala said next to her Chilean colleague.
"If there were, there would be, and would be, a country that respects international law, a peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," Pinnera added, and welcomed Umalu's hand in the light of the flags of these two countries.
The two presidents confirmed that they were subject to the International Court of Justice immediately after Colombia protested the Bogotá Covenant this week, which recognized that it was subject to the verdicts of the International Court of Justice after a decision on the sea borders from Nicaragua, which it found to be wrong.
The summit took place in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rusef; Venezuela, Ugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Kristina Kirshner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011 following the influence of former President Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
The President-in-Office, Olianta Umala, was responsible for opening morning discussions and closing the summit, to be heard later on the afternoon in Lima Time.
The Head of State read the outcome paper, which reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 projects had been approved for South American countries, amounting to $17 billion.
He mentioned among the agreements adopted that UNASUR countries would take " important steps for the purpose of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the place of residence agreements".
He reported that efforts were being made to improve “cooperation against the insecurity of citizens and organized transnational crime, to increase the availability of medicines, low access to the Internet in all parts of South America, and to take into account the overall and effective risks of natural disasters”.
As Europe is in crisis, "an economic union (Latin America) should not have a triumphant base but should serve to broaden our productive base and provide a better future for our cities," Umala added.
"We have decided to give the group the privilege of 31 flag projects that will improve the link between South America, especially in rural and border zones... by uniting our countries and forming new economic schemes," said the Peruvian President in a read-in communication.
Among these projects, he referred to five of them as Peru, and limited by the transverse axes in its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two of them aimed at a long relationship with Ecuador, but he did not provide any further details.
The outcome document also addressed the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve its re-accession to the Southern American Union", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, to be united, and to have a good relationship between neighbours, was another theme highlighted at the summit.
In this regard, President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia said before attending a regional meeting, which he hoped to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortego, on Saturday in Mexico to negotiate in a respectful manner on the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of the international court challenged by Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (on Saturday), maybe I'll meet President Daniel Ortgo," Santos said.
"We will review all these ways, they are not mutually exclusive, including the Nicaraguan pact will require discussion with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will deal with this as civilized and respectfully as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they have the presence of the new president of the country, Enrique Penjena Nyeto.
Also at the meeting, the Defence Ministers of the Block met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which aimed at strengthening dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although participation of the last of the countries is suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
"South America must learn in Europe about the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common nationality is the goal in which "South America, in this case, must be studied in Europe".
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, told Peru's public television that Europeans "killed each other during the Second World War" and in other clashes, "as they are now almost one family".
It protected, in this context, a project for establishing South American citizenship, which was approved by UNASUR countries.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as has already been done with members of the Andean Community, must be achieved, but there are still reaction sectors that wish to bring us back to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador has also shown himself to be the proponent of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS), subject to a reduction in the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and to take into account those who have signed the San-Hose Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who read the lectures will never take up any obligations, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
“We cannot explain that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington and is funded by the United States,” he said, looking forward to the political asylum given by Ecuador by the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assanju.
Correa assured her that she did not regret the decision, because he did not betray his principles with him, but respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights”.
He added that in his time, “there were certain suspicions that Assang would be extradited to a third country and that the process would not be followed”.
He also criticized Swedish justice for claiming to come to his territory for questioning the alleged sexual offence, while “Swedish law alone considers it possible to implement it through a video conference that could be made by the Embassy of Ecuador in London”.
Correa confirmed that there was a risk of deterioration in Assanga's physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since he got to our embassy, but the Ambassador told me he had a small legit problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of State.
What is really true is the danger of deterioration of his physical and mental health because of infestation in a small space without the ability to perform exercises in the air.
"It affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the asylum issue given to Assanju since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London was in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judiciary, and stressed that there was negotiations in London to find a solution to the problem of the infestation of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate human rights, this word we do not use in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judiciary, because Assanza’s lawyer, Baltasar Garson, is conducting a number of trials in various European institutions,” he said.
And he said, "If Britain gives the guarantee of integrity tomorrow, it will end."
And if Sweden, as well as its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, would question Mr. Assanza in the Embassy of Ecuador in London or ask him about Skype, that problem will be resolved tomorrow.
Correa took the opportunity to prove herself a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that she did not tolerate “directness, mistrust and lies that distort freedom of expression”.
"The main enemies of freedom of the press are not prosecuted politicians, but bad journalists who support survival, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this respect, he remained satisfied that neither these journalists, "no bankers nor bourgeois gegemons do not rule in Ecuador", and added that, being re-elected, "will deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction".
Korea also supported the decision to retain Paraguay's veto in UNASUR at least before the next elections, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support the conversions under the masquerade law", because in fact "this has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
In addition, the Ecuadorian President felt that his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos' wish to hold negotiations with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which was in favour of the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty, was “perfectly justified”.
This decision is not being complied with at this time.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
It is necessary to process them together to overcome them and to keep moving forward.
He also hoped for a good conclusion to the maritime border dispute, which was held in the same court in Peru and Chile, and said that “it was proper for Latin America to address international institutions if two countries were committed to making a decision whatever it was difficult to do”.
As a candidate for the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador for the third round, he pointed out that he considered this option “with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes rather difficult”.
Correa assured us that if she won the February 2013 election, she would leave public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in unfair situations, such as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political authority.
"My political movement felt that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to acknowledge this responsibility," he said.
In the event of a victory, it would be my last time in the presidency, and then we will leave public life.
If we lose, it's the same thing.
"That's the decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicholas Maduro, who told me that he had gone to the treatment that had already been planned, routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean an increase in President Chavez's health," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian State took part today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
AIDS mortality today - late diagnosis results
The plant was 21 years old when it was announced that its AIDS analysis had given a positive result.
"I'm as deaf as you are," he remembers that difficult, despite all the doctor's touch, the moment.
The young man hid it from his family.
When he decided to cope with his illness on his own, he wanted to know as much about it as possible, and his efforts were justified - he had already noted his 43rd birthday.
The factory is one of the "old" patients of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara Hospital (HCG), where it fell in 1994, and there were many obstacles.
He's been living with the diagnosis of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) for 22 years, and it would be difficult to believe that in the early 1990s there were too few treatment options, too few knew about the disease, too little about the disease, too much about the disease.
So even the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection's clinic didn't want to say goodbye to him, "because he had taxes."
In other words, having AIDS at that time was a sentence.
Now it's possible to survive this syndrome and do it, not bad quality of life.
However, while not aware of their disease, many people still come when the virus has already damaged their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the outbreak of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, “the great achievement at this point is that the survival of the patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population in exactly the same manner,” said HCG, Heime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV department, referring to the fact that this information was confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008 scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the duration and quality of life depend on the rate of immunodeficiency in patients at the start of the diagnosis, with the best life expectancy in those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years of age with 200 CD4, and up to 50 years when 500 CD4 is reported.
Simply put, the above means that a person with a 25-year-old HIV-positive diagnosis, according to these terms, “holding control, can live without problems for up to 75 years”, he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be recalled that the life span of Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since the AIDS outbreak.
Only 255 people died in the country in 2011 and 187 deaths have already been registered by May of this year; however, there is widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still lethal sources?
- I don't think there's a problem with access to treatment.
That's how I imagine it is, so it's in our hospital.
As we haven't had a lack of medication in the last 12 years, the problem is that patients come very late because they don't know about their condition, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
He said: “9 out of ten patients come when they already have any opportunistic infection; what must be done in order to have a greater impact on overall mortality, so that it can be diagnosed at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for mass detection for all people who will ask for it.”
Its proposals reflect the views of experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Halisco (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who applied for a study in a private laboratory only because it did so to one another and, despite his youth, had already been at the AIDS stage and had even suffered from the rabies of Kaposi, a cancer that was one of the most common difficulties.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything.
"I'll die anyway, I'd better hope three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I'm eating well, I'm doing exercises, I'm taking medication.
To this day, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of work, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, I care about myself and another person," said the Factory, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO, in order to encourage those who are now in the context of the World AIDS Day, in fear.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible whether they were HIV positive or better, and if they already had a diagnosis, let them know that they could live like any other person, being responsible.
This message summarizes the topic of combating AIDS in 2012.
Can not open message
A major gap between health programmes and a simple citizen, Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalahara, is concerned with HIV-related issues.
And the biggest is prevention.
In the areas that deal with this problem, "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, we have been given one or two before, now we are given hundreds of packages, and this is very good, but it seems that there are those who still do not have access to condoms," he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why are they for you?" said the propagandist, who was accused and condemned by social workers, school counselors, pharmacies and health workers who did not want to hear teenagers.
I suggest that this is not an effective distribution; that condoms be not only adjacent and that hundreds of them be in public bathrooms in places where young people often visit.
This is not a promotion of divorce.
There is no question about the payment of beer and the motel, Governor Emilio González replied when asked if it would be possible to supply condoms under his direction.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms available to those who are already engaged in sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Halisko
A total of 13,435 cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV) have been reported.
The State has 4th place in the national rating on new and summary AIDS and 13th HIV cases.
92% of the infections are sexually transmitted, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are between 4 and 5 registered people who do not know about it.
Taking into account the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of a decision that cancels the restructuring of the Group of Vitro's debt achieved through competitive production in Mexico, the scenario sets a time-bound precedent for any national subsidiary company in a neighbouring country that has payment capacity problems.
It appears that procedures to support the survival of firms permitted by Mexican laws are not valid in the country as opposed to international agreements.
In practical terms, the decision of Judge Harlin Hail in the court of bankruptcy of the northern district of Texas on 15 June leaves unprotected Mexican firms in the face of the possibility of arresting their property on that side of Rio Grande.
However, the order opens the door to the leading manufacturer of glass in Mexico to be brought to the United States Supreme Court, proving three inconsistencies.
As an introduction, while the judge notes that creditors must be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth District Court of Appeal, located in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings concern competition in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of non-payment of transnational profile enterprises.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law on the uniformization of the law of international trade was established for this purpose by defining the American Institute of Law as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict states that, without an inter- firm vote, the critical mass of the competitive debt production that had been held before the subsidiary of Vitro would not have reached the majority necessary for the approval of the restructuring.
However, the Mexican laws recognize this opportunity.
In fact, Vitro wasn't the first time this scheme was taken.
There are dozens of examples, including Agrex and Commercial Mexicana, whose inter- firm debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competition.
It is also true that, with the votes of the subsidiaries, whether or not Vitro creditors, who fought against him in the United States courts, namely the Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited funds, would not reach the majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
These data are being dropped by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation that he has faced since 2008 in the face of the serious economic crisis that struck the United States.
As long as the Gonzales Sad family firm appeals a decision in the Court of Appeal itself for the vote to be brought before the plenary, that is, five judges, in the light of the only three votes cast.
In the event of failure, an application for a certificate will be submitted, which will require a review by the Supreme Court, in this case by the United States Supreme Court.
The worst thing is that the court rejected a document aimed at the Government of Mexico as a friend of the curiae ("second court"), which describes the process to be followed by Vitro under the Competition Act, signaling that it is free from compliance with agreements signed by both countries to link it with article 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
It is also noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, i.e. the rules established for cross-border insolvency that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Carambol from two ships: they're in Vitro and they're in the country.
General balance
In view of the complaints lodged for several months on the table by the Mexicana de Aviation trade unions against the former owner of the company, Gaston Ascarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraud, has already found a bottleneck by the trade union pilot association.
The institution headed by Carlos Dias Chaves Morino has just filed a criminal case against the National Banks Commission and the securities charged with impeding justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to provide reports to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office concerning an operation carried out by an entrepreneur to extract from the trust fund of IXE 198 million pesos, on behalf of Mexicona Airlines.
Resources would be directed to purchase shares from the Professional Management Company.
As you know, Ascarrag Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas branch network.
Surrounded by Dragon Mart
Assembled at the Caribbean University Forum, a group of local and foreign ecologists, scientists, businessmen and members of the common civil society approved the establishment of a broad front to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, about the giant sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, of the country ' s isolated production, with a living area close to 150 companies.
In the past, Canacintra has been able to unite South-East zone governors to resist the Monumental Forces, which have compared some of the protected territories to the ground and pose serious threats to the industry.
Death of ACTA
With regard to the Government ' s refusal to explain the circumstances and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Trade Agreement to Combat Counterfeiting, known as an abbreviation in the English ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the case has already gone to the archives.
As you know, the action has been implemented, despite the fact that the Senate itself has disqualified the opportunity to view it as a violation of freedom of expression in social networks.

Hettin Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
A busy basketball traveler, Hettin Reyes, was more than 60 years old related to this sport and, thanks to him, traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector Hettin Reyes.
And since before the stroke in the brain caused him to become disabled in 2008, Reyes was loaded into sports for more than 60 years, as a game of small categories, as a game of the High Baseball League, as a leader and leader of BSN with Cuba Baymon and the President of the Federation of the Baseball.
"I have played many roles in basketball for the duration of my life, including several times as I was President BSN, Director General of the National Team and President of the Federation in the 1990s," Reyes recalls during a visit to Primera Hora at his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating, making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all adorned with photographs and monuments gathered along his long way, testify to this.
Beamon in the Heart
With the greatest emotion, he kept those who remembered his way through Cuba, starting in the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when his 15 years of speech became a co-agent or contract agent.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed most, because I had been able to be part of eight cowboy champions since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or leader.
There were many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Minsey in BSN.
Since then, the leader has been Cuko Ortis, who has been a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember Jean Bartov, who was here at the University of Alabama (Birming), said to me, "I have a very strong game for you, 6'7."
"Do you want it?"
And it was the beginning of Minsey, one of the best players who had been in Puerto Rico.
Bartov then recommended the sniper Raymond Gauss, who became a national and one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minsey brought the Bayamon Championship, Gauss would help win another one.
I enjoyed the Kowboev and Gaussian Championship, but it was already far away, because by 1988 it had already been the head of the Federation.
Until then, I have preferred to enjoy his achievements and achievements in the National Assembly.
I remember how we won for the first time in the United States during the 1989 Olympic Qualifications tournament in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, where we got the fourth place, and it must have been bronze, if not the Canadian judge who made us play the final game, Reyes said.
The 1990 World Championship team is the best assembly you've ever seen?
She was among the best, as was what she won the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that from the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and broke the U.S. assembly, which was quite similar to the one that won our bronze at the World Championship.
Not only did Minsi, Gaussian, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and 'Pikulina' (Ortisa), but also young (Hawier) 'Tonyito' Colon and James Carter, Brother Leon (France and Edgar) and Mario 'Qihote' Morales, who were unable to participate in the 90s due to knee trauma.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personal composition, but which brought us the gold medal and great joy, was the 1995 Olympic Qualification Tournament team in Neuken, Argentina.
With role-playing games like Canito Neves, Pablo Alise and young Roland Hurruitner in exchange for those who temporarily lost their lives at the Mar del Plat Pan-American Championship, we won the gold against all predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it was Piculin Ortis.
Its indicators at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level as Piculin did.
And it's not taking his career into account in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very difficult question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melandes, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From young people, I really like Leo Arilla's work.
What do you think of your main achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most famous era of the national assembly between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s BSN there were up to 17 teams in the season.
What are you still doing?
There were things I wanted to achieve, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, boys from Ponce play only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island at national playoffs.
Now the guys travel and play too much, and that's too much.
At least I see the fruits of mandatory certification and course for managers, officials and judges.
It brings me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, I watch music videos of my era on YouTube, I enjoy my grandchildren and I'm going to basketball games.
And, of course, I am enjoying my wife's society, Iqabel, who was always with me.
Larry Hegman's death
Larry Hegman, born 21 September 1931 in Fort Worth (Tehas), became world famous for his main role as John Ross Yuing, more known as "J.R.", in the Dallas teleserie, where he became a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hegman, whose role as oil magician J.R. Yuing, in the Dallas teleserial became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hegman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas season, died on Friday evening because of the difficulties caused by cancer, according to the family statement given to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the Dallas production studio.
"Larry returned to his beloved home town of Dallas, again playing a role that he liked most," said his family.
Larry's family and their closest friends were with him in Dallas on the fair for Thanksgiving.
Linda Grey, who played his wife's role in the original series and in the cycle, was close to Hegman when he died at Dallas Hospital, told her representative, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, kind and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," Grey confirmed in a statement.
Hegman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted that he had been drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the liver and transferred to the transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hegman got to know on TV thanks to the role of a regular type in the light comedy I Dream of Jeannie, broadcast by NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets the attractive girl-jinna who plays Barbara Eden and begins living with her under one roof.
He was also the main character of two comedies, which rarely appeared in the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included the roles well-recognised by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But that's exactly his master's interpretation of an amazingly disgusting J.R. led Hegman to the top of glory.
The CBS drama series on the Yuings and other characters in its surroundings took place in the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot J.R.?", designed to create a noise around the episode, full of emotions in which Hegman's characters are not being killed, has generated international discussions and millions of dollars that were at risk in bookstore offices.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the show at the time.
When an answer was given in the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers looked at it and turned Dallas into a second-of-view entertainment programme in history, after the end of MASH in 1983, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was the owner of J.R., Christine (according to Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. prevented her and then threatened her that she would be accused of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hegman played Yuing as an unsatisfied corrupter with charismatic smiles: an dishonest businessman and an unfaithful husband who wanted his wife, Sue Ellen, to be treated.
"I know what must be on J.R." said Hegman in 1988.
It must be said, "This is where an honest citizen J.R. Yuing will rest."
It's the only deal he's lost.
Victoria Principal, also a hero of the original series, recalled Hegman on Friday as someone "great, on both screens."
He is not forgetful and unchangeable to millions of readers around the world, and in the hearts of every one of us who has been blessed to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas release were shown several months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
Five episodes of the second season were completed and the sixth was in production, the channel reported.
Warner or TNT have not yet made statements about what will happen to the series after Hegman's departure.
The native of Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of an actress and singer Mary Martin, who bluffed in classics such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Martin was still a teenager when he was born in 1931 during his marriage to a lawyer named Ben Hegman.
He was happy at the New York theaters in the early 1950 ’ s and then served in the UK VHS from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist, May Axelsson, and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Haydi, and they lived long in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Talll (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I did not include anything there that would seem able to cause pain to anyone or affect them in any way," said the Press Association at the time.
After the liver was transplanted, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients who were afraid.
"I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go into surgery, and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be okay."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
A course is under way to study "The End of Light"
Every week, students study apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this semester, when religious professor Stuart Sharme decided to read the course about the end of the world, he knew that he had an unrepeatable appetite: the end of the "long return" calendar of May, 21 December, for which many people were arrested as proof of the end of the world.
But Sharme had no idea what was expected of him in the next few months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a financial crisis that some call the "long Armageddon" and the growing conflict where Israel is attracted, where Christian theorists believe that Apocalypse will begin in time.
"I didn't realize it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," Sharme told students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
To analyze what is happening in the world right now, as if we had only 30 days left, it was really a good time.
And remember, it's bad for those with apocalyptic ideas.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on the theme of "the end of the light" in this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Templar, Assistant Professor Barry Wacker reads the course entitled Media, Culture and the End of the World.
Students study apocalyptic themes every week, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We're analyzing why these ideas are being circulated over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that trigger certain human actions.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war may break out.
This month, the students analyzed films on apocalyptic subjects and studied how they relate to real - life examples.
"I've tried to tell the students that maybe it's probably unlikely and impossible," Wacker said.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amar Solari, a former professor of art and anthropology, joined to read a course called the End of Light.
"We don't add '2012' to always have the opportunity to read the course again if the end of the light doesn't come," said Restall.
Despite the “necessary destruction”, students must learn, prepare projects and submit final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be held in the Canon of Apocalypse, which does not leave students with a choice but to work “until the very night in which the light is supposed to come to an end”, Restall said.
Courses were quite popular.
"The cities ended in two hours," Restall said about his course for high-school students, with 35 students enrolled.
We received e-mail messages many weeks before the beginning of the semester from people who asked if there were any more places.
Students, in turn, assure themselves that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridged Robinson, 23-year-old student of Haddonfield's Department of Religion and Sociology, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic form of thought, light or religion, is just a matter of comfort or lack of it.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old student at the Psychology and Nurse's Office, said he was watching all the apocalypse films.
"I've never heard of a course I'd learn from it," he remarked.
I like him.
But none of the students who have been questioned -- not about the professor -- did not say that he believed in the date of the end of the light on 21 December.
"Our first project affected May's prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student of the last course at the West Chester Templar University.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it was just a key moment in the calendar, said Restall.
But he noted that there is apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which spans several centuries, where people react to changes around themselves, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused these speculations to increase.
"People in other places don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in English-speaking world.
Joseph Dodgerty, professor of religion at La Sal University, who teaches classes in the Philippines this year, quickly replied to the question of whether he knew of any "end of light" course there.
“The Philippines does not take part in the end of the world”, he wrote, pending the Supreme Court.
We have the Pope's forgiveness.
Restall pointed out that for a long time the final court had been talking about many days, and said that if nothing happened on 21 December, "people would immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophy that 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period in which the world would end.
Students and teachers are safe to date.
Some say they're going to the end of the light party.
"I may call some friends to laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old college student.
