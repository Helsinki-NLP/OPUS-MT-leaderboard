The members of the Wells Assembly are concerned that they will "associate with maps"
Some CAs are threatening the recommendation to change the name of their post to "member of the Wells Parliament".
This recommendation was based on plans to change the name of the assembly to the Parliament of Wells.
THE political spectrum is concerned that it can cause laughter.
A L.A. of the Laborists claimed that his group was worried about the Romans with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wells: in Welsh, "twp" means "unsubtle", and "pwp" means an act of defecation.
A.K.A. from the Wells Party said his group was "not satisfied" and offered alternatives.
One of the Welsh conservators said that his group was "unpredicted" to change the name, but noted that MWP could quickly become a "map".
In this context, the English word “w” is similar to the English word “u”.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently developing legislation to change the names, noted: "The remaining decision on the new name of the members of the Assembly will certainly be taken by the members themselves."
The Law on the Self - Control of Wales of 2017 gives the Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public debate on the proposals, and the re-election of the Assembly in the Wells Parliament was widely supported.
With regard to what is called the CA, the Commission proposes to call them "members of the Wells Parliament", that is, WMP, but the MWP version has received the greatest public support.
Of course, the CHA offers alternatives, but trying to reach agreement can cause problems to the head of Elina Jones, who should pass a bill on change for several weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules of the CA and the structure of the committee system.
THE final vote on their new name will be taken when the legislation is discussed.
Macedonians are going to vote on a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, the polls announced whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The vote was organized to resolve a multiannual dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Athens have long claimed that the name of their northern neighbour is a claim on the territory of Greece, and repeatedly protested against Macedonia's membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgie Ivanov, who is opposed to holding a referendum on the change of name, said that he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, claim that the change of name is just the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's calls are silent, because Harlem's churches are going through difficult times.
“The old people I was talking to say that there was a bar and church in every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
Now there's nothing else or nothing."
He believes that the disappearance of bars can be understood:
"Today people are socializing differently.
Bars are no longer the local guest room where they go regularly.”
As for the churches, Adams is afraid that money from the sale of assets will not be as long as the leaders expect, and “early or late they will be found where they started. ”
The churches, he added, can replace houses with condominiums, and there will be people who will not help the saints who stay close to them.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these houses will be white, ” Adams explained, “so this will speed up the day when all these churches are closed, because it is unlikely that the majority of those who move to condominiums will become their relatives. ”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: The Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and Saint Martin was ten years later.
The white Methodist community left here in the 1930s.
The black community, which had performed rituals nearby, had the right to build property.
Saint-Marten went to the black community under the direction of John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of the various traders on 125th Street, Harlem's main trade street, and they didn't want to take on the work of blacksmiths and raise them in service.
In 1939 a fire damaged the building, but the parishioners of Johnson’s father wanted to restore it and set up a carilion.
Dear David Johnson, son and successor of Johnson's father in St. Martin, proudly called the Carolina "the calls of the poor."
The expert who played the carilion in July called it the “cultural treasure” and the “unchangeable historical instrument”.
This expert, Tiffany Ng, from Michigan University, also noted that it was the first carilion in the world to be played by black-skinned musician Dionysius A. Lind, who went to the largest carilion in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merrievere, he had no replacements in St. Martin.
What's happening in Saint Martin over the last few months is a difficult story about architects and subversives, some of which were joined by church leaders, others by the Episcopal Epicureans.
The council, a leading organ of the parish, made up of the leaders of the Meridians, wrote to the Eparchy in July that it was concerned that the Eparchy would “success to pay the expenses” of the council, because the Council did not participate in the hire of architects and subcontractors sent by Eparchy.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the parishioner.
The shark was traumatized by a 13-year-old boy who was stalking Lobsters in California.
According to official figures, on Saturday, the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and traumatized him, and the boy went after the Lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the Lobster season.
The attack took place about 7 a.m. at the Bikon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego that in the morning of the Saturday he had been drinking with his friends for about half an hour, when he heard the boy was crying for help, and the group rushed to him to get out of the water.
Hammel first thought it was just a catch from the catchment of the lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting, "I've been tasted!
They tried to tempt me."
As soon as he got to the boy, he saw that his key was completely broken.
"I called everyone out of the water, and they said, 'In the water of the shark!'" said Hammel.
The boy was delivered to the Children's Hospital of the Council in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark that made the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Jails at the media briefing told us that a few weeks ago the shark was spotted in this area, but it was established that it was not related to the dangerous species of sharks.
Jails added that the victim had suffered trauma damage to the upper body.
For the purpose of investigation and security, the authorities for 48 hours protected access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ensinitas.
Jails noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to go to the British cosmetic market
Sainsbury's is going to compete with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with cosmetic islands similar to those in universities.
As part of the enhanced exit to the British cosmetic market of 2.8 billion pounds of sterlings (continues to increase at the time the sales volume of clothing and household goods decreases) increased cosmetic islands will be protested in 11 stores across the country.
Investment in cosmetics is that supermarkets are looking for ways to use local space that used to be used on television, microwave ovens and household goods.
In Sainsbury's, they say they double the range of cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 products, including brandies like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees range will get more space: there will be brand zones like those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also updates the cosmetic range of Boutique: Most of the products presented will now not be protested on animals, as young buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the retailer Fragrance Shop protests his batches in two Sainsbury's stores: the first batch opened in Croydon, Northern London, last week, and the second opens in Sellie-Ouk, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and shopping to buy small quantities of food every day in small stores makes supermarkets make extra efforts to attract visitors.
Mike Cupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, said that their stores would become more like universities, because the supermarket network is trying to resist the discounts of Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's open the Argos department in hundreds of their stores, also opened a series of Habitats departments. Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and claimed that this increased sales of food and made both networks more profitable.
The previous attempt to update the supermarket by cosmetics and pharmaceuticals was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but she ended up arguing about how to split the revenues from monkeys in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its optical business (281 pharmacies) Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help by adding an extended range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hex, commercial director of Sainsbury, said: "We have changed the appearance of our islands with cosmetics to make the atmosphere more pleasant to our customers.
We also invested in specialized consultants who could give advice.
The brand range presented to us is called to meet any needs, and the pleasant environment and comfortable location means that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which is a competitive old way of buying."
Peter Jones "exhaled" because Holly Willowby made a deal worth 11 million pounds of sterling
The Light Dragon Star, Peter Jones, is "exhaled" because the Holly Willowby TV has come out of a deal with his brand of goods for life (the value of the deal is 11 million pounds sterling) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willowby doesn't have time for a brand of household clothes and Truly accessories.
The couple's business was related to the Goop Gunnet Peltrou brand.
The 37-year-old leader of this Morning program announced his admission to Instagram.
Holly Willowby brought Peter Jones' Light Dragon star to the death penalty when she finally came out of their profitable business for life to focus on new profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources reported that Jones was "distorted", when a golden girl from the TV confessed at a busy meeting on Tuesday at Johns' headquarters in Marlow's capital, Buckinghamshire, that her new contract costing 1.5 million pounds of sterling means that she no longer has enough time to devote it to their joint brand of household clothing and accessories True.
This business was related to the Goop Guineat Peltrow brand and was to double Willowby's stock, estimated at 11 million pounds of sterling.
When 37-year-old Willowbie reported in Instagram that she was from True, Jones flew from Britain to one of her holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly, no doubt, was Holly’s main priority.
He was to become her long - term future for the next few decades.
Willowby's decision to get out of business surprised all the interested parties.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, almost before the start.
In Marlow's headquarters, full of stuff ready for sale.
Experts believe that the introduction of this Morning guide, one of Britain’s highest - paying stars, could cost millions of firms due to large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothing and household clothing) and create further delays at the start.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willowbie’s children and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tari Kapp, for ten years.
Willowbie and Capp created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as head of government in March.
The couple held a holiday together, Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin’s stock market.
Willowbie will become an M&S brand ambassador and replace Anthony McCarterlin as leader of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
The source, approaching Jones, said last night, "We won't comment on him."
A cruel conversation, "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he received from the news media for a comment that someone would consider as "unpredental" and also for a very positive attitude towards North Korea's leader.
"Why did President Trump go on such a big deal?"
Tramp said, imitating the voice of the newsman.
I didn't go any further."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denucleiization have gone into the blind corner.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the leading North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see a "reaction" from the United States on its first steps to disarmament.
Instead, he noted that the United States continued to impose sanctions to support the pressure.
In giving the talk at his meeting, Trump was much more optimistic.
"We have a good relationship with North Korea," he said.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have such a wonderful relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim had brought positive results: ending the missile trials, releasing hostages and returning the remains of American military personnel home.
He also protected his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to behave more Presidentially, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this battle of the beat stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed hundreds of islands
In particular, after the earthquake in Lomboca, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need help.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lomboki population have been affected, the national disaster has not been announced, which is a prerequisite for receiving international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they are not addressing international aid, so it's kind of difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although "Let's save the kids" is collecting a team to travel to Paul until we know whether foreign personnel can work on the spot.
Mr. Sutopo, a representative of the national disaster relief agency, said that the Indonesian authorities appreciated the situation in Pala in order to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
Considering that earthquakes continue to take place in Indonesia, the country remains horribly unplanned to the wrath of nature.
In the province of Aceh, the tsunami shelters are built, but they are not typical of the other coasts.
The apparent absence of a siren warning about the tsunami in Pale, although the warning was effective, likely contributed to the death.
Moving between many Indonesian islands is not just the best time.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The medical ship that was in Lomboca to treat the victims of the earthquake swims to Pala, but to reach the site of the new disaster can be at least three days later.
President Joco Widodo has improved Indonesia's infrastructure on the basis of his election campaign and has increased the cost of roads and railways.
But the lack of funding created problems for Mr. Joco's administration, which is planning to be converted next year.
Mr. Joco also avoids lasting interconfessional enmity in parts of Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority chose a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, tens of thousands of displaced persons from their homes as a result of the opposition of Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using swords, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Starridge from Liverpool kills a goal from the bottom of the field and compares the account from Chelsea.
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from the defeat of Chelsea in the Premier League at its 89th-minute goal on Saturday at the Stemford Bridge London Stadium.
Starridge received a passport from Jardan Shachiri when he was about 20 feet [27 m] away from Chelsea's gate. At this point, his team lost 1-0.
He turned the ball on his left foot and loaded it in the direction of the far side.
The ball flew high above the penalty in the direction of the upper right corner of the gate.
He flew over the speeding Cape Arrisabalago and fell into the gate.
"It was just an attempt to take that position so as not to waste time. Players like Shachiri are always going to attack as much as possible, so I just tried to get as much time as possible," said Starridge LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Cante approaching, and I made one touch, and I didn't think about it too much, and I just took the ball.
Chelsea said 1-0 after the first time in which the Belgian star One Azar shot a goal in 25 minutes.
The attacker handed back the passport to Mateo Kovacic, turned around in the middle of the field, and ran fast for half the Liverpool.
The cook quickly burned in the wall in the middle of the field.
He then made a beautiful pass that led to the execution of Azariah.
Azar turned his back on the defense and made a decisive left-hand strike on the remote side of the bar.
Liverpool plays against Naples in the group stage of the League of Champions at 3:00 a.m. on Wednesday at the San Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.

The number of tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832, reports the Indonesian agency of disaster relief Sunday morning.
Many people were left in the trap of building fragments destroyed during Friday's earthquake by 7.5 points, which caused waves of six meters high, the press secretary of the agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho reported at the press conference.
The city of Pala, in which more than 380,000 people live, was demolished by broken buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was killed.
The murder investigation began after the woman’s body was found in Birkenhed, Mercisside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with knee wounds in Grayson-Museum, John Street.
The police called for a response from people who saw or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "Research is now in the early stages, but I'm asking everyone who was near John Street in Birkenheda and saw or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I also ask all, especially the cab drivers who could take something from the video recorder, to contact us, because information on these videos can be very important for our investigation."
The police officer confirmed that the woman whose body was found was the residence of Birkenheda and was found in the house.
Today, in the second half of the day, friends who think they know a woman came to a crime scene to ask where they found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have stated that they are immediately informing the nearest relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson-Museum just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police said that nobody was allowed to go into the house and get out of it.
When he learned what had happened, he lost his gift of speech.
People are now told that hours will pass before they are allowed to return home.
Someone heard a policeman tell a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
At the crime scene, a woman appeared in tears.
She says, "It's so horrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were standing behind the fence, another van standing in front of the fence.
Several policemen stood behind the fence and followed a multi - room house.
All who have information are asked to write a direct message @MerPolCC, call 101 or call anonymously on the Crimestoppers line number 0800 555 111 and call code 247 and date 30 September.
Cromwell's statue near Parliament becomes a new memory that is affected by "historic rewriting"
The removal of the statue would be due to the destruction in the Taliban-style of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, which were carried out by its fantastic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Creek's proposal "stupid" and "promising to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, said: “To sum up the current debate on the withdrawal of the statues, what the statue of Oliver Cromwell at the Westminster Palace would be the target was inevitable. ”
An iconocracy during English civil wars was not carried out by Cromwell himself or by his order.
It is likely that Cromwell was not to be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The great statue of the sculptor William Hamo Tornichroft is a testimony to the moods of the 19th century and a part of the story that many believe should still be honored.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many are probably more likely to be in the late 19th century than they are now to be considered as the protector of parliament from outside pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Is such an idea entirely correct — the subject of historical debates that persist?
There is no doubt that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has defined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the well-known figures that represents one side of this conflict.
Its achievement as a Lord Protector should also be noted and respected."
A Chinese farmer killed a pig killer before he died.
According to local media, the farmer was attacked and killed by pigs on the market in southwestern China.
The man, identified only by the name of Juan, was found dead in blood with a broken artery near a pig market in Lipanshui, Guizhou, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
In Sinina, China, on May 30, 2005, pigs are to be vaccinated in pigs.
It is reported that on Wednesday he left with his twin brother from the neighboring province of Greece to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the brother found him dead and saw that the door of the pig’s door was open.
The brother noticed that there was a large shed with blood on the floor.
The medical expert confirmed that the 249-kilogram cab had destroyed the farmer until he died.
"The feet of my cousin were in blood and confusion," said the cousin of a victim named Wu, quoted as Guiyang Evening News.
The security footage showed that John entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to John or his twin brother.
The market manager told Evening News that when the police collected evidence at the scene, the pig was locked up to prevent her attack on people.
It is reported that seven of me am Yuan and the market administration are discussing compensation for his death.
Even rarely, however, cases of swine fever have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and struck a man with a fatal injury.
Ten years before that pig weighed 295 pounds [295 kg], a Welsh farmer kept pressured to the tractor until the farmer’s wife feared the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can be a trigger.
"They're just playful.
They're like children, very curious... they don't want to harm you.
You just have to treat them with proper respect, ” he said.
The remnant of the hurricane will bring abundant rains to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening, moving over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the next few days, Rosa will bring rains with rains north of Mexico and south-west of the United States.
The rose had a wind speed of 137 km per hour (this hurricane category 1) at 5 a.m. on the east of Sunday and was 620 km south-west of Punta-Evgenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to go north on Sunday.
In the meantime, over the Pacific, there is an intruder that moves east to the western coast of the United States. On Monday, Rose approaches the Gulf of Lower California as a tropical storm, and it starts to push a strong tropical humidity north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rose will bring up to 25.4 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Then, in the next few days, a tropical humidity that interacts with the nearby vegetation will produce strong floods in the southwest.
In this area, between 2.54 and 10.2 cm of rain will cause dangerous flood currents, garbage flow, and the possibility of drifting in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will increase the number of dropouts by 5-7.6 cm per hour, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5-10.2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwestern region, especially in the vast area of Arizona.
The rains are possible when conditions are severely deteriorating because of the widespread nature of tropical rains.
We strongly advise not to go to the desert of the foothills, as tropical rains may occur.
Heavy rains can make the canyons stormy, and forests will bring storms and storms.
Nearing the bay will cause heavy rains in some parts of the northern coast of California.
The number of wastes can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause the influx of waste streams and waste roads.
This will be the first river in the region in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, and on Monday and Tuesday evenings will be more extensive.
The strong rain will go over For-Corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, intense temperatures across the U.S. territory may be observed, since the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropicals remain rather warm.
At times, this results in severe changes in the temperature at short intervals.
A fine example of severe temperature fluctuations in the central part of the United States will be observed on Sunday.
It's almost a 7-degree difference in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and De Mons, Iowa.
During the next few days, the summer heat will try to return and spread again.
It is expected that in a large area of central and eastern U.S. will be warm until October, and the temperature from the south to some parts of the north east will be 27 degrees Celsius.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, about 12 degrees Celsius above the average temperature.
According to our long - term weather forecast, there is a high probability of an increase in average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Cavano case
On Thursday, more than 20 million people on six television networks observed the exciting testimony of a candidate for the post of Judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano and Christine Blaise Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence, as it seemed, in the 1980s.
Political opposition continued, channels were interrupting planned programs to report the latest Friday news: a deal prepared by Senator Arisoni Jeff Fleic, on a one-week investigation by the FBI on charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavano was drinking it and trying to get her clothes off at a party at the senior school.
Cavano in his emotional testimony said that he was 100% sure that it was not.
It's likely that more than 20.4 million people were observed on Friday, as Nielsen's research company reported.
The company calculated the average audiences CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
It was not immediately possible to obtain numbers on other networks that also showed listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has problems with measuring the number of people watching television in offices.
For comparison, such an audience in size is similar to an audience that looks at the player of the Playoff series or the Oscar Award.
Fox News Channel, whose lead show strongly supported the mission of Cavano, was the leader of all the channels during the entire day’s hearing, with an average attendance of 5.69 million in Nielsen.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to representatives of Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after listening.
Flake became the central character of the Friday drama.
The office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he was going to vote for Kavana, and then, on Friday morning, the CNN and CBS cameras recorded how protestors were shouting at Fleke when he was trying to go to the elevator to listen to the Court Committee.
He was standing with his eyes down for a few minutes, during which he was licked, which was transmitted in a direct epherite to the CNN.
“I am standing right in front of you,” said one woman.
You think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said to him, "You have authority over women, and they have no authority over you."
Fleeck reported that his office had published the application and, before the elevator closed, added more to the committee’s hearing.
All cable and broadband channels were broadcast hours later when the Judicial Committee had to vote on the candidacy of Kawano to the Senate in full.
Fleeck said he'd do it only if he knew that the FBI was going to consider charges against the candidate next week, which the democratic minority demands.
Flecka was partly convinced of discussions with his friend, Senator Chris Kuns.
After the conversation with Kunsa and several senators, Fleke made a decision.
Fleka’s choice had an impact, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes to appoint the Cavano without investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into Kawano's accusations.
British Prime Minister Teresa May blames critics for "games in politics" around Brexit
In an interview with Prime Minister Teresa May, Prime Minister of Sunday Times accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union in "political games" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Teresa May attended a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom.
In another interview, which took place next to Teresa's interview on the first page of the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson criticised her so-called Checkers Plan on Brexit, stating that to propose Britain and the EU to impose on each other the customs “absolutely absurd”.
Who shot Wade Sims: The police arrested Dayton Simpson for suspecting the death of a player at Louisiana State University
Police arrested a suspect in a shooting that led to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University.
Dayton Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and sent to prison for murder of the second degree, reported to the Baton-Rusher Police Department.
The authorities published a video of the dispute between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to an affiliated CBS TV channel WAFB, the police removed the eyeglasses from the scene of the crime and noted that they found Simpson's DNA on them.
After questioning Simpson, the police reported that he had confessed that Wade had been shot.
According to the lawyer, he was assigned a deposit of $350,000.
The coroner's office, East-Bonton-Russia, published a previous report on Friday, indicating that the cause of death is a fire wound to the head and neck.
The Department expresses its appreciation for the special subdepartment in search of fugitives from the state of Louisiana, the criminal lab of the state police, the South University police and local citizens for the assistance of an investigation that has contributed to the arrest.
The sports director of the University of Louisiana Jo Aleve thanked local law enforcement authorities for their “old age and desire for justice”.
Simsus was 20 years old.
Forvard grew 198 cm tall in Baton-Russia, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the University of Louisiana.
In the past season, the average result was 5.6 points and 2.6 points.
On Friday morning, a basketball coach at the University of Louisiana, Will Wade, said the team was "depleted" and "shocked" with Wade's death.
"That's what worries you all the time," Wade said.
The volcano throws ash on Mexico City
The ash that casts out the Popokatepetl volcano reached the southern regions of Mexico City.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Alert Center called for Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, as the crater began to be active and 183 gas and ashes were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was followed by numerous noises and currents.
The pictures on the social media show fine ash layers on the lobby of cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico, such as Cheimilko.
Geophysics have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano, 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital, after an earthquake of 7.1 ball in central Mexico in September 2017.
Vulcan, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police met with Catalan separatists before the year before voting for independence
Six men were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independence protestors met with a special police department, and thousands of people joined the protest demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote on separation.
The proseparatist group in the masks that were restricted by the specials threw them into eggs and powder, creating dark dust clouds on the streets that are usually full of tourists.
The clashes took place and later on that day, the police were using sticks to prevent aggression.
A few hours later, a group of independent supporters who were chanting, "We won't forget, we won't forgive!" met with supporters of the country's conservation who were shouting, "Let's live Spain!".
According to local press reports, fourteen people were helped by the mild injuries they suffered during the protests.
A year after the referendum of October 1, which Madrid recognized as illegal, but is marked by Catalan separatists, the tension in the region that wants independence remains high.
The electorate decided largely to vote for independence, but the appearance was low, since most of those who opposed the division were voting.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in a violent conflict last year as a result of police efforts to stop voting in polling stations throughout the region.
Independent groups spent the night in tents on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to take another route.
68-year-old Narsis Termes, an electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
"Last year we survived one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry for joy that they can vote, but now we’re in the middle of a deaf corner, ” he said.
Despite the important but very difficult victory of the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan parties that come out for independence failed to preserve the momentum this year, because many of their most famous leaders are in voluntary exile or incarceration for their participation in the referendum and further declaration of independence.
Hoan Pueg, a 42-year-old mechanic who took a protest to support the police on the phone, said that the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
“Employment is increasing, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders, who is in the next isolate from the end of last year, announced that next year he will be flying to the European Parliament.
"The status of the candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repression that we see from the Spanish government," he said.
London: The men were arrested after the car went into the house
Three men at 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after the car drove home several times in London.
The incident occurred at Ballinagard-Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in British Standard Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings noticed that the door was damaged and the house itself.
At some point in time, the car was shot off by an arbalette.
Mangy's hit ensures Lowington to win over Rangers with a 1-0 account.
The first goal of Dolly Mengi in Lowington became the winner
Raised in the Lowington class, Rangers surprised and brought Stephen Gerard a second 18-game defeat as Ibrax Club Manager.
The Dolly Mengy hit proved decisive: Harry Holt's team rose to one level in a second from "Hibernian".
The Gerard team won no victory at the Prime Minister of this season, and the next week, it's playing with the Harts leaders, from which it stays at eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will take Rapid Vienna as part of the European League.
Meanwhile, Lowington continues its invincible move to six games in the division, and Master Coach Holt has not yet suffered defeat since Kenny Miller was replaced last month.
"Liveington" misses the chances of missing guests.
The Holt team was supposed to be ahead of them long before they were killed, because their straightness creates the Rangers all the problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but struck the door, then Alan Litgou broke through the door after he resisted and took the impact of Craig Halkett along the door that he had made his head.
The masters were satisfied that they had allowed Rangers to play before them, and they knew that they could cause problems to guests from standard positions.
A decisive goal was put to death.
Rangers missed a free shot, and Lowington made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson took on Mango, who took the ball and killed it from the crime center.
By this time, Rangers had been dominated by the rule of the ball, but the protection of the owners of the field had proved to be unbreakable for them, and the gatekeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
This trend continued in the second time, although Alfredo Morelos was able to hit Kelly.
Scott Pittman's kick was shot by a gambler named Rangers, Alan McGregor.
The shuttles were constantly on the move to Lowingston and were constantly neutralized, and two applications were rejected after the attack by Halkett on Glenn Midlton, who took the lead in the game.
"Livingston" phenomenon: analysis
Aladdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
A phenomenal game and the result "Livington".
They all played well together, and they continued to surpass expectations on this exit track.
Their style of play and composition has practically not changed since they returned to the highest level, but they should be given the right Holt for how he mobilized the command after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett played enormously, organized very well, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to keep on the watch.
Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under the direction of Gerard, but now they are not very much involved in those standards.
They didn't have enough of the last ball -- only once they broke through the housekeepers' defense -- and that was something like the Rangers Awakening, which was in the middle of the table.
Erdogogan was widely accepted in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, there was a smile and a blue sky.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
There have been some disputes between them on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open up a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
In terms of security, the police didn't let 25,000 people meet in front of the mosque, but many of the President's supporters came close to seeing him.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — many Kurds among them — have also made themselves heard, and they condemn the policy of Erdogan and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
Bilateral protests testify to the indifference of the guest, whom some German Turks called heroes and others as dictators.
Road accident in Depford: The biker died in a car crash
The driver died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the crossroads of Bejudd Street and Evelyn Street on a live road in the district of Deptford in the south-east of the city about 10:15 a.m. after the British standard time.
The driver stopped, and the paramedics arrived at the scene, but the man died.
This accident happened a few months after another biker died after the flight from the place of adventure to the Childers Street, about 1.6 km from the accident on Saturday.
The London police said that they were working on establishing a man to inform his closest relatives.
Bus routes are also banned, and drivers are recommended to avoid this area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Prisoners Tragedy
Six prison staff were injured as a result of a man's incarceration, the prison administration reported.
Incarceration in Her Majesty Long-Lartin's prison in Woostershire began at about 09:30 a.m. in British standard time on Sunday and is still going on.
To stop the interference, initiated by eight prisoners and located in one wing, a special section called "Tornado" was called.
The officers were provided with medical assistance in connection with light facial traumas received at the scene.
A prison representative commented: "In order to resolve the incident in her Long-Laertin Highness Prison, specially trained prison personnel have been involved.
Six employees received medical assistance in connection with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and that the length of their stay behind the gates may be delayed."
Her Majesty Long-Lartin's prison has more than 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was reported that the chief of the prison had been sent to the station after the prisoner's attack.
In October last year, a special police department was called up to stop serious disturbances in which prisoners were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with a flood of floodwaters.
Tropical depression rarely occurs in Arizona, but this can happen at the beginning of the next week, as the remaining hurricane of Rose is heading through the southwest of the desert, creating the risk of floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of the floods Monday and Tuesday in the territory from western Arizona to south and east Nevada, south-eastern California and Uti, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, and Monday night will be rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have saved the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) from Phoenix since 1950.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) from the Arizona border.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Center of Hurricane, in the Mogollon-Rhym region of Arizona, it is estimated that between 5.08 and 10.16 cm and 15.24 cm of precipitation.
Other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are probably from 2.54 to 5.08 cm of waste, possibly up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of flooding, Rose’s rain can be a blessing because the region is suffering from drought.
Although the lungs are a very serious problem, some of these evils are likely to be useful because the south-west is experiencing drought right now.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitoring Centre, some 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffers at least from extreme drought, which is the second highest dry category, reports weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rose leads to the shifts in the Gulf of Lower California, Mexico.
Rosa, on Sunday morning, still in force at a maximum wind speed of 137 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta-Evgenia, Mexico, and moves north at 19.3 km per hour.
The storm is meeting with colder water in the Pacific and is thus weakening.
Thus, it is expected that during a tropical storm day or night, the hurricane will cause a drought in Mexico.
The number of falls in some parts of Mexico may be significant, causing a significant risk of floods.
"It is expected that the total number of falls from Lower California to the north-west Sonora will range from 7.62 to 15.24 cm, possibly up to 25.4 cm", reports weather.com.
Then Rosa will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the border of Arizona early in the morning as a tropical depression that will continue through Arizona and then arrive late at Tuesday evening at South Jutta.
"The main danger expected of Rosa or her remains is very strong rains in Lower California, North-West Sonoria and in the South West of the American Desert," the National Hurricane Centre reports.
These rains are expected to lead to life - threatening floods and waste streams in the desert, as well as droughts in the mountainous region.
An attack in Midsummer Norton: four people were arrested who were intent on murder.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspecting murder after they found a 16-year-old boy with a knife wound in Somerset.
The early teenager was found in the Excelsior Terras district in Midsomer Norton about 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was delivered to a hospital where he remained stable.
A 17-year-old, two-year-old, and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstok area, police told Avon and Sommerset.
The police are asking to answer everyone who can have any video of these events on the phone.
Trump says that Kavano was "tolerable and angry" by the Democratic Party.
"The vote for Judge Kavano is a vote against the ruthless and hateful tactics of the Democratic Party," Tramp said at a meeting in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavano had been "tolerable and angry" by the Democratic Party throughout the suspension process.
Cavano witnessed to the Congress on Thursday, indiscriminately and emotionally, rejecting Christine Blaise Ford’s accusation that he had committed sexual violence against her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave testimony to the charges against her.
On Saturday, the president stated that on that day "the American people saw the brightness, nature and courage" of Kawano.
"The vote for Judge Kavano is a vote for one of the most advanced lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a perfect experience in the state service," he said to a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president briefly mentioned the Kawano uprising when he spoke of the importance of the emergence of Republicans in the Middle Ages.
"In five weeks, one of the most important choices will take place in our lives.
I do not run, but I do run, ” he said. — John 17: 3.
That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
Trump claimed that the democratic mission was to “stand up and prevent”.
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on the candidacy of Kavana will take place no later than Friday, a CNN assistant from one of the Republican leaders reported.
Hundreds of people have died of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, and the number of victims is increasing
At least 384 people died, many died in the ocean when giant waves hit the beach as a result of intense earthquakes and tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the country’s authorities declared on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were resting at a beach festival in Palo on Friday, when waves of height up to six feet (18 feet) fell on the shore, killing many and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after the earthquake by 7.5 points.
"When the tsunami was threatened yesterday, people were still busy with their affairs on the beach and did not start running away immediately, and they became victims," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a representative of the Indonesian disaster relief agency (BNPB) at the Jakarta briefing.
"It wasn't just tsunamis, it was moving cars, trees, buildings, it hit everything on the dry land," Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the shoreline, the tsunamis passed through the open sea at 800 km/h (497 miles/h).
To save himself from the tsunami, some people entered the trees and survived.
About 16,700 persons were evacuated to 24 centers in Pala.
The aerophotos published by the disaster relief agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been torn down and destroyed, and the pool is surrounded by water.
Posts in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy released as a result of a severe earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of the long, narrow bay, could contribute to the strength of the tsunamis, said the agency.
Nugroho called the loss "wide-scale" and noted that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found under broken buildings, he said, adding that 540 were injured and 29 were missing without a message.
Nugroho noted that the victims and damage could be greater than 300 km (190 miles) along the shoreline north of Pala in the area called Donghal, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"The lines of communication were completely damaged, and we didn't get any information," said Nugroho from Dongali.
More than 300,000 people live there, said the Red Cross, and it adds that its personnel and volunteers have moved to affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it can get a lot bigger," says the report.
On Saturday, the agency received a broad criticism of the fact that it did not report that the tsunami had hit Paul, even though the officials said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
On the amateur frames that people shared in social networks, it is evident that a man on the top of the house is uttering crazy warnings of the approaching tsunamis of people on the street under the building.
A few minutes later, the wall of the water collapsed into the beach, taking the buildings and cars with it.
Reuters was unable to verify the reality of the cameras immediately.
Earthquake and tsunamis have caused a serious power failure, which has broken the connection around Pala, which has complicated the coordination of rescue operations.
Military personnel began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities reported, but evacuated people still need food and other necessities.
The city airport was only opened to help, and it will be closed by October.
President Joco Weidodo was to visit the evacuation centres in Palo on Sunday.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia is over 800.
It's very bad.
The co-workers of the World Vision organization in Dongali were welcome to the city of Pala, where they were hiding in the tenthouses set up in the courtyard of their office, but on their way they saw the scenes of desolation, said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw many ruined buildings," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups have taken decisive action, some have complained that foreign humanitarian workers with much experience are not allowed to go to Paul.
According to Indonesian rules, funding, supply and provision of personnel abroad can only start if the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the province level," noted Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can accept international aid, but this status is not given."
It was the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, and the friends and families of those who had not yet found it were still hoping that the appearance of their loved ones would be a miracle that would adorn these clouds to bring about natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers received a woman who was lying under a stone for two days along with her mother’s body next to her.
Hendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian national team of paraplanetics, trained two missing paraplanetists to participate in Asian games that had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paragliders who had fallen into a trap at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandaga, were his disciples.
"As an elder in the field of paraplaneism, I have my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Hendon reports that a few hours after the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel, which spread among the paraplanetary community, he sent a message to whatsapp rivals Pala, who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked only by one grey hair, not by a double blue hair.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves took $26,750 while filling the ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, a thief stole $26,750 from a staff member of the Brink, who ran a ATM in Newport on the Levee, reported in a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The car driver emptied the ATM into the fun complex and prepared to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the news.
While he was busy, another man “runs back to a Brink employee” and stole a bag of money to fill.
The Witnesses noticed a number of suspects fleeing the crime scene, but the police did not indicate the number of participants.
Anyone who has information about these people should contact the Newport police number 859-292-3680.
The West Canyon: the rapper changes its name to E
Reper Kanye West changes his name to E.
On Saturday, when he announced a change in Twitter, he wrote: “It was previously officially known as the Kany West. ”
41-year-old Westa was sometimes called E, and he used this shortcut as a name for his album released in June.
The change took place in front of him on Saturday Night Live, where he was expected to present his new Yandhi album.
On the show, he replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons," said the show's author.
This is not just a shortcut to the current professional name; West used to say that it has religious significance for him.
"I believe that "is" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West at the beginning of this year, discussing the name of his album with the radio-leading Big-Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
The canyon, which means "one", has been shortened to just E, is just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
The canyon is one of several well-known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Paff Grandpa, P. Diddy and Grandpa, announced this year that he had chosen the name Love and Brasser Love.
A former colleague of Westa, JAY-ZI, also experimented with defissive and large letters.
Mexico President Andres Manuel Lopez Obador promises not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopes Obador, promised never to use the army against civilians, and soon the country will mark the 50th anniversary of the curved debate on students.
On Saturday, Lopes Obrador promised “never to use an army to suppress the Mexican people”.
On October 2, 1968, the military shot a peaceful demonstration in the field, killing about 300 people, and then the left student movement began to be established throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to the learners and opening up more free state universities.
He noted that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education lead young people to criminal groups.
US$ double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
Since China is increasing its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. has to double the amount that they spend on research in this area, it is considered an investor and practice in the area of the CIA Kai-Fu Lee, who was working on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were made after various parts of the U.S. government made claims about the CIA, although the U.S. has no formal strategy in the field of the CIA.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: It wants to become No. 1 by 2030 in the field of innovation in the CIS.
"The preliminary budget for the CHI research would be a good start, considering that all other countries are far away from the United States, and we are preparing for the next breakthrough in the CHI field," Lee said.
Double-financing can double the probability that the next great achievement in the field of the CIA will be made in the United States, Lee said in an interview with the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "The CIS States: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month, is the Director General of the Synovation Ventures Fund, which invested in Face++, one of the most famous companies in China.
In the 1980s, he worked at the University of Carnegie-Mellon on the S.H.I.S. system, which played the best American player in the "Otello" and later was the executive director of Microsoft Research and the president of the Google China branch.
Lee noticed previous advances in the U.S. government's technology contests, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects (DARPA), and asked when the next will be available to help identify future prospective participants.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win state grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders, it's corporations," he noted.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies in recent years have been hiring a light from the universities for the work of the CIA.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to increase efforts in the field of HIV.
"I think the Green Card should be offered automatically to applicants for science in the field of the CIA," he said.
The State Council of China published its Plan for the Development of the Artificial Intelligence of a New Generation in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Fund provides funding to people working in academic institutions, just as the National Science Fund and other U.S. government agencies distribute money to American researchers, including the quality of academic work in China below, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence created a Joint Art Intelligence Centre to involve industrial and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee of Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA also announced an investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
With regard to the National Science Fund, he now invests more than $100 million a year in the CIA research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, who wanted to create the Commission from national security of artificial intelligence, did not take any steps for several months.
Macedonians voting on a referendum to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to "The Republic of Northern Macedonia", which will allow for a multi-year dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's membership in the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbor is a claim on its territory, and has put a veto on Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments made a deal based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the agreement claim that this change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he wouldn't vote on the referendum, and because of the campaign, there's a doubt whether he's going to make the minimum 50% vote, which would make the referendum a reality.
The question in the Bulletin of the referendum is, "Do you support NATO and the EU membership under the terms of the agreement with Greece?"
The name-changers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, claim that this is the price Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, should pay for accession to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young of Macedonia, so that she can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievsky in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have stated that they support it in order to make it more decisive.
To change the name, two thirds of Parliament will be required.
The State Election Commission stated that no reports of violations were received by 13:00.
However, only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters threw their ballots into the ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," declared 62-year-old voicer José Tanevski in Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in Stromica, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, his wife Zorika and his son Duško gave their vote on a referendum to change the name of the country, which will open the way for accession to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Volodymir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents organized by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proud head, not through the service door," Kavardrak said.
We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can address others, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zayev believes that NATO membership will bring much needed investment in Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20%.
"I believe the overwhelming majority is voting for, as more than 80% of our citizens are voting for the EU and NATO," Zayev said after the vote.
He noted that the result of “yes” would be a confirmation of their future.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research in Macedonia, 30 to 43% of voters will participate in the referendum, which is the most necessary event.
According to another survey conducted by the Macedonian telephony Telma, 57% of respondents are scheduled to be voted on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote for.
In order for the referendum to be recognized as true, the appearance should be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat at the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policy of the Western government from the beginning of its work in May last year.
Look, Sergio Aguaro from Manchester City is going through all of Breyton's defenses and is killing the goal.
Sergio Aguaro and Rahim Sterling went through the Bryton defense and brought Manchester City a 2-0 victory on Saturday at the Etihhad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's goal at the 65th minute of the match looked ridiculously simple.
The Argentine attacker received a passport at the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between the three Bryton defenders and was in the open field.
Then Aguaro realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He went to one of the defendants, and then he ran a few more on the edge of the Briton.
Then he made the dog on the left when he saw Sterling.
The English foreward made the first touch on the fine to hand over the ball Aguaro, who had his right butt run him right into the right part of the door, defeating the Bryton ballman Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some leg problems," said the reporters of the City Manager Pep Gardiol.
We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he killed a naked man at this point."
But the initial advantage of the blue sky in this premier league has secured Sterling.
This goal took place in 29 minutes.
Aguaro got a ball deep in Briton.
He sent a beautiful pass along the left flank of Leroy Sane.
Leroy made a few dots and then made Sterling’s passport in the direction of the distance.
The sky-block foreward threw a ball in the door just before he went outside.
The City will meet Hoffenheim in the group stage of the League of Champions at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Shercer wants to take a look at Rokis.
Since Washington Nashiols was out of playoffs, there were no major reasons for waiting for the round start.
But the Shercer who is inclined to compete is expected to go out to the Pitcher Mountain on Sunday in a match against Colorado Rockies, provided that Rokis is still in trouble with going out to playoffs. Now Rokis is playing one game ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League.
Rokis has at least a wild card for winning 5-2 over Nashionals on Friday night, but they still want to strengthen the title of the first division.
"Despite the fact that we're playing for nothing, at least we can leave the ball, knowing how the viewers are doing here in Denver, and the other team will probably play at the highest level I've seen all this year.
Why would I not want to participate in this contest?
"Nashionals" will announce who's going to be the first painter on Sunday, but it's reported that they're inclined to be Shercer.
The Shercer, for which this is going to be the 34th start, took a picnic session on Thursday and can play on Sunday, usually the weekend.
Washington's right is 18-7 out of 2.53 ERA and 300 strike cars in 220 2/3 inches this season.
Trump Meetings in West Virginia
The president briefly mentioned the situation around his candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano when he spoke of the importance of the appearance of Republican supporters in the Middle Ages elections.
"All we've done will be put on the map in November.
Five weeks later, one of the most important choices in our lives will take place.
It's one of the big, big ones — I'm not running, but I'm really running, so I fight for great candidates wherever I can," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democracies, you see that it's happening right now.
And they're firmly set up to restore power, using any means, you see vanity, corruption.
They don’t care who suffer from them, who need to be violated to gain power and control, they want power and control, we don’t want to give them.”
The democratic mission, according to him, is "to resist and hinder".
"And you see it during the last four days," he said, calling the democracies "bad and vile, disgusting and false."
He mentioned the Senate Judicial Committee, calling Senator-Democratic Diane Finnstein on behalf of the audience to raise the voices of dissatisfaction.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Well, that's it.
No, e-e, no, I'm waiting -- it was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a large church.
It is intolerant to those who express their opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted in favour of condemning me, it almost turned out to be a surprise.
Finally, I'm the last of those Members of Parliament who have been told they're not happy, and that's all because we're expressing our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was almost the same because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
I was convicted of not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, is ironically similar to those that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East team meeting said Friday: "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of the Friday evening meetings of the General Committee in my eight years as a local member of Parliament of the Laborists were the same.
Unfortunately, today many meetings have a completely different tone, and the promise of a "more kind, more soft" policy has long been forgotten if it was ever started to be carried out.
It becomes increasingly evident that there are no different views in the Labour Party, and each opinion is appreciated by the position that it is acceptable for the party to take the lead.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and colleagues with whom I had previously felt that I had similar political views began to expect that I would turn 180 degrees and take the position that I would never agree with, whether national security or the single EU market.
Whenever I go public — and it doesn't matter what I'm saying — there's a bunch of attacks on social networks that call for withdrawal, the central policy conviction, I'm told I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
I know that I've been happier than some of my colleagues because my comments are usually political.
I am attracted to the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face each day the flow of sexist or racist attacks, but they never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that the Labour Party should raise a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're no longer such a broad church, and with every movement of "untrust" or change of party selection rules, the party is tied up.
Over the last two years, I've received a lot of advice.
But I didn't come into politics.
I joined the Laborists 32 years ago as a schoolboy, because because of the absence of attention from the Tetcher government, my class in high school was literally undressed, since then I want to improve the quality of state services for those who need them most, whether local advisor or government minister.
I never hid my policy, including in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East was concerned about my political views and differences with today’s leadership.
For those who have contributed to Friday's events, I just want to say one thing: when the country moves to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and state services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
In fact, I have another message, but not for Notingham's Momentum, but for my voters, as members of the Labour Party, whether or not: I am proud of what I do for you, and I promise that no threat to call me back and no political advantage will make me act according to what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

"Eir" 38 - 17 "Melrous": Unpredicted "Eir" climbs up
The last two attempts, perhaps something has confused the final outcome, but the Air has certainly earned a triumph in today's great fun match of the Premierschip of Scotland.
Now they're taking over the table, it's the only unconquered team of ten.
Finally, a fine defense and improved ability to use the opportunity gives Peter Merci’s hosts and coaches the full right to be satisfied.
"We've been testing our games today, and we're still unattainable, so I have to be satisfied," he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose commented, "I see the right "Eir," they'd better use their chances than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute trial, carried out by Frasier Klimo, led by Air, but a yellow card for Scotland's Captain Rory Hughes, published by Verriers, allowed Melrose to show the figures, and Jason Baggot used an unrealized trial.
Klimo increased Air leadership by using the penalt, and immediately before the break, made and realized the solo test, which gave the 17-5 account for Air.
But Melrose had a good start on the second time, and Patrick Anderson's experiment with Baggot had reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a delay due to the serious trauma of Ruarid Knott, which was brought out of the field on his feet, and from the Air Restaurant, they went ahead using the experience of Stafford McDawell, which was realized by Climo.
Captain "Eir" Blair Mcferson then had a yellow card, and again "Melrose" forced another player to pay for Bruce Colvin's unrealized attempt under intense pressure.
The masters returned, but when Stroan Hatchinson got a yellow card for the arrest of Climo without a ball from the criminal scene line, Makferson made a tachdown behind the Air mill.
Klimo made the attempt that he did almost every time after the restaurant, then Kyle Row got hit by David Armstrong in the box and sent Gregor Henry's flanger to the fifth attempt of the master's team.
It looks like a still playing star set up for a new career in the restaurant field.
It looks like a Ford Kiran's still playing star is set up for a new hospitality career, and that's what you can conclude after it's known that he's the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor, Jack Jarvis, is playing in a popular BBC television series, a script he writes about, and in which he is filmed with his former comedy partner, Greg Hemfil.
Duet announced that the future of the ninth series would be the last in the series, and it seems that Kirnan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although the source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan wants to enter the glazing restaurant business.
"Our Sea": interior mathematics Bolivia hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are patrolling the fleet headquarters in La Pasi.
Public buildings hang out an ocean blue flag.
Sea basses from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with a motto: “Our sea is right.
We have to get him back."
In Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of a coast line that left Chile in the 19th century's curved conflict over natural resources, and there is a desire to sail back into the Pacific.
These hopes are now probably the strongest in the last decade, as Bolivia is waiting for an international court ruling on October 1 after five years of trial.
"In Bolivia there is a pulse, there is a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, it expects a positive result," commented Roberto Calsaday, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the announcement of the ICW decision on large screens throughout the country, and they hope that the Hague tribunal will take a decision for Bolivia that after decades of Chile's break-up talks, they will have to negotiate Bolivia's sovereign exit to the sea.
Here Morales, the charismatic root president of Bolivia, who faced opposition to his conversion next year, also puts great hope in a decision announced on Monday.
"We are very close to the return to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not make a decision for Bolivia, and if that happens, there will be little change.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no authority to condemn the Chilean territory and has noted that it will not determine the outcome of the negotiations.
The decision taken by the ICU only six months after the final arguments were given indicates that the case was "not difficult", said Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Bolivia’s case has not been resolved, and in the last four years, it has been possible to move back.
"The question of access to the sea was used by the current Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
The military rhetoricist Morales destroyed the remains of Chile’s kindness, and she admitted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but then it will be very difficult to discuss.
Two countries have not been exchanged since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Welltz, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, disagreed that the court’s decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given “a unique opportunity to start a new era of relations from Chile and the opportunity to end 139 years of differences with mutual benefit, ” he said.
Calsaday also denied that Morales, another of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the sea as a political force.
“ Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific, ” he added.
This decision is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen if it can't trust the U.S.
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never give up its nuclear weapon first before they can trust Washington.
Riya made a presentation at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to carry out the promises made during the summit in Singapore by the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments appeared when US Secretary Mike Pompeo appears to be on the threshold of relaunching nuclear diplomacy, which went into the deafer corner more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Chen Inn.
Ri says that the belief that the continuation of sanctions and the U.S. declaration of the end of the Korean War will once put North Korea on its knees is a “unrealized dream. ”
Washington is afraid to adopt a declaration before the Pyrenees take significant steps towards disarmament.
And American President Donald Trump wants a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that the Pyrenees take seriously the rejection of their arsenal, which the country probably considers to be the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompey plans to visit Phanyan next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
In the Paris fashion shows, the latest trend of massive major clothing is on the main streets of your city.
If you want to increase your hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you've found what's right.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown have demonstrated a number of eccentric master clothes in the summer-summer 2019 collection in the stages of a brilliant Parisian fashion week.
Very unpracticed hats filled with Instagram this summer, and so - called designers have already sent out their memorable creations beyond the stage.
Valentino was seen as an extravagance runaway hat with wide decorated feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Among the other accessories are decorated with precious stones of cavé, the hat of a witch and even the hat of a pineapple, but they're not to keep their heads warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated an assortment of original masks — very timely before Halloween.
Many of these different color masks had protected lips and reminded Hannibal Lekter more of them than of a high fashion.
One creature recalled a watering device with a tube and eyeglasses, another looked like a frozen blade that collapsed.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you're lucky.
The stylists say that giant hats can go out on the main streets of your city.
Overseas hats came into the fashion thanks to La Bombi, a salmon hat with a width of 60 centimeters that they saw at all: from Ryan to Emily Ratajkovsky.
A cultural brand standing behind a very impractical hat that could be seen everywhere on social networks gave peace another creation: a salty beach bag of almost the size of a model in the bathroom that carried it.
The sum of the yellow-red rafia with a rafia bacrum and a white leather handle was the central element of the La Riviera Spring summer 2019 brand Jacquemus in Paris's weekly fashions.
Famous Stylist Luke Armitaz told FEMAIL: "The next summer, I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the main streets of the city, because the influence of the designer is so enormous that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for over-accessories."
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is a must for citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools support high standards of education, and in 2018, excellent results have been received again, complementing individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other fields.
These schools, which teach more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are presented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SHRH) and aim to provide the best level of service for students and their parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for the further and higher education they have chosen as their careers, as well as to make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable objects for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak with a person’s language that he understands, he will take it with his mind.
If you speak to her in her native language, she will accept it with her heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the final results of this year’s exams, we see that in independent schools, languages are guided by the best - rated ratings of objects.
In general, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received upper secondary A.
Data gathered in 74 SRNA schools showed that 72% of students received high grades A from China, 72% from German students, 69% from French students, and 63% from Spanish students also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages to be vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, language as an object of choice is taught in the same way as the objects of ICT (scientific, technical, engineering, and mathematics), in independent school programs, and in other institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17% of the reasons why employers are unable to close vacancies related to the lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in the preparation of young people for future careers.
Since more and more prospective positions are in need of language, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if someone learns another language, he'll have a real advantage in the future, because it's a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who has several languages the advantage over competitors.
According to a survey by over 4,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75 percent could not speak the foreign language well enough to support the conversation, and the French is the only language spoken by a double percentage (15%).
That is why investment in language teaching is now important to modern - day children.
Knowledge of several languages, especially in developing countries, will give children more opportunities to find a full - time job.
In Scotland, each school will study its language.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for Britain from the perspective of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests in independent schools, you can always choose several languages to study them with qualified teachers.
Scotland’s independent schools try to create an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to achieve success regardless of what the future has prepared for them.
We cannot now deny that languages in the international business environment continue to be vital to the future country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be regarded as “the skills of international communication. ”
Independent schools will continue to give this choice, variety, and perfection to the Scottish youth.
It needs to be done.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Libron's debuting with Lakers in San Diego.
Fans who want to see Libron James' first start for Los Angeles Lakers almost waited.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play Sunday in the first preseason match against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
How many minutes he'll play, it's not decided yet.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Official Lakers website.
The Players reporter, Mike Trudell, told us that James, more than anything, would play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six games of the preseason Lakers chart.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career," he replied.
Trump Meetings in West Virginia, YouTube
President Donald Trump today launches a series of pre-election meetings from the city of Willing, West Virginia.
It's the first of the five scheduled for the following week of Trump's meetings, including meetings in friendly states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the candidacy proposed by him to the Supreme Court was postponed, and Trump wanted to form support for the future Middle Ages elections, since the Republicans risk losing control of the Congress after the vote in November.
What time is it going to be tonight's Trump evening meeting in West Virginia, and how can we look at it on the Internet?
Meeting Trump in Willing, West Virginia, scheduled for 19 hours to spring today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch the Trump meeting in West Virginia online below in the direct epheri on YouTube.
Tramp probably mentions the tensions of hearings that took place this week from the application to the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano, accused of sexual harassment, and the postponement of the Senate's vote for a week while the FBI's investigation is ongoing.
But the main purpose of this series of meetings is to help Republicans gain popularity before the November elections.
President Trump's representatives said that these five meetings next week aimed at "activization of volunteers and supporters, because Republicans are trying to save and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
"Congress control is so critical to its order of days that the president will go to as many states as possible, because the tense pre-election campaign season is approaching," said Reuters, a representative of the Trump campaign, who did not want to call his name.
Today's meeting at the Wesbanko Arena stadium in Willing can be held by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as a video from Pittsburgh, reports West Virginia Metro News.
The Saturday visit will be the second one in the last month of the Trip to West Virginia, in which it received more than 40% of the votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a candidate from the Republican Senate to the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morris, whose rating remains as a result of the polls.
“ It’s not good for Morris that the president is coming to raise his rating in the polls, ” commented Reuters Simon Heder, a politician at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder 2018: U.S. team set up to fight and hopeful ahead of Sunday singles
After three sessions, which ended with a unilateral victory, the Saturday afternoon forts can become the same as that of Kubku Ryder.
An emergency pulser is a fully invented sports concept in which players really believe, especially in similar competitions.
So when do they say the pulse is working?
"They were forward to six points, and now to four, so I think we'll take it a little bit as a impulse," said Jordan Spit when he left.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four fronts and twelve more in the game.
The Americans, as Spit says, feel a little wind in their windmills, as well as a lot of encouragement, not least the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each one made three eyes out of four.
The sleep with his killer hits from the tee to the border shows an example.
These shuddering shouts of celebration became louder when, in the course of his round, he made a decisive plea and compared the score to the fourth match after he and Thomas were left for two eyes.
His duck, who let them win the match on 15 August, met a similar scream, which tells you the American team doesn't seem to be.
"You really just have to try very hard and worry about your own match," Spit said.
That's all each of these players left right now.
18 lungs to become familiar.
The only players with more eyes than Spyt and Thomas in the last two days — Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable story of Kube Ryder.
It's unusual, but a magic couple from Europe has four out of four and they can't make mistakes.
Molywood was the only couple who didn't make the gods on Saturday after lunch, they also managed to avoid the gods on Saturday mornings and after lunch on Fridays and on Fridays at the nine last lunches on Friday mornings.
This race and how their energy seems to flow to this noisy crowd and back, makes them believe that they win Sunday and that there will be no more popular players except Flethwood or Molinari to strengthen the Europeans' potential victory when the sun goes over Le Golf National.
He wants to go to different holes at the same time.
However, talk about the triumph of the Europeans as early as possible.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quarreled with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning spells when he was married to Alex Norren.
One god and two dabs on the first nine holes led the Spaniards and the Swedes to a hole from which they could never get out.
Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
It is very interesting to observe closely the interaction between the participants, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and how the strategy can change in one moment.
Europe, while playing better than a team and has a great advantage over the last day, has also shown that the U.S. team is going to fight what some, especially Americans, are in doubt.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of Kubka Ryder
In the final day, the Cube Rider Europe will have a solid advantage, because after Saturday's foramboles and forsoms, it beats the United States with an account of 10-6.
The inspired duet of Tommy Flethwood and Francesco Molinari won two victories over the remaining Tiger Woods, and now on Le Golf National they have four balls.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who was trying to return the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in the morning spells with an account of 3-1.
The U.S.A. did more resistance in the forsoms and won two matches, but they could not reduce the cracks.
Jim Furick's team needs eight points in 12 Sundays to keep the trophy.
Flethwood is the first European novelty to win four sets of games, while Mollinara (also "Moldwood") after the sensational outputs is only a second pair that has taken four points in the first four matches in the history of Kubque Ryder.
With Woods and Patrick Reed in the spells, they've joined together to win the dead Woods and the new American Brisson Deshambo with even more effective 5th4.
Woods, who pulled out two matches on Saturday, showed a random flash of genius, but immediately 19 of his 29 matches were lost in the forks and forsoms and seven matches.
Justin Rose, who was not involved in the morning meals, returned to Henry Stanson's partner in the forsoms to get a 2t1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are the first and third in the world ranking.
Europe has not been able to do everything in its own right to this pleasant new day in the south-west of Paris.
Three of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas’s top winner set the standard for Americans on Saturday with their two eyes.
They won a decisive victory over the Spanish John Ram and Ian Poulter in the Forbola and later beat Paul and Rory McClroy with an account of 4t3 in the Forsomas, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Kubka Ryder team returned with a deficit in four eyes in singles, although the Furika team is only needed to save the trophies.
However, after the second place for two days, the contraction on Sunday seems to be out of their hands.
North Korea says that "in no way" will not be armed in a unilateral order without confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister reported on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions deepens confidence in the United States, and that under such circumstances the country will not be able to give up its nuclear weapon.
Ri Young Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that in the past year, North Korea had used "essential measures of good will", such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling nuclear testing sites, and the obligation not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"Once, we don't see a corresponding reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will never be the first to arm ourselves in a unilateral order."
And although Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's "step-by" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea will be rewarded by progressive steps, his statement was important because it did not deviate from the unilateral denuclearization that was done by Phanyan in the past.
Rí made a joint statement by Kim Chen In and Donald Tramp in the first story of the summit between the real president of the United States and North Korea leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for work on the "declaration of the Korean peninsula", and Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea longs for the formal end of the Korean War from 1950 to 53 years, but the United States has declared that the Pyrenees must first renounce nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes the call for a reduction of severe international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on "denominations first" and increases the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their goal violently, and even rejects "the declaration of the end of the war," Rí said.
"To consider that sanctions can put us on the knees," the inexplicable dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our confidence."
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to the three meetings of Kim and South Korea's leader, Mún Choe In, in the last five months, and added, "If the party to this issue of denuclearization would be South Korea, rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not go to such a deaf corner."
Despite this, Ri's tone of speech was very different from the last one when he told the General Assembly that the targeting of North Korea's missiles on the U.S. mainland was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "a human missile", who wanted to commit suicide.
This year, in UN Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, Kim praised for his courage in using disarmament measures, but said that there was much more to be done and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea's denuclearization.
In the middle of the Trump noted that he did not set a time frame for this: "It will take two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council is to reward Pyrenees for their steps.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey stated to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “Implementation of the Security Council sanctions should continue energetically and uninterrupted until we see complete, final, confirmed denuclearization. ”
The Security Council has unilaterally increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to block the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles in Beijing.
Pompey met Ri in the halls of the United Nations General Assembly and then said that the next month he was visiting Phanyan again to prepare for the second summit.
Pompey visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was a failure.
He left Phanyan in July and commented that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea sentenced him to “gangster requirements. ”
During this month's meeting with Moon, North Korea promised to pick up the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States is using the "appropriate measures".
He said that Kim said he needed the "appropriate measures" to guarantee the security that Trump had promised in Singapore and the steps towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on how to rest enough
The new course at Harvard University this year has given all of his students more sleep, and it's an attempt to fight the growing culture of the harsh learning all night after the caffeine processing.
The teacher found that students at the university number one in the world are often uneducated when it comes to the very foundations of how to care for themselves.
Charles Chesler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Women’s Hospital in Brigham, has developed a course that he believes is the first such course in the United States.
He decided to start a course after speaking with a lecture on the effect of getting out of sleep.
At the end of the day, a girl came to him and said, "Why are you telling me this right now, in the last class?"
"She told me that no one had ever told her the importance of the dream that surprised me," said a teacher from The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, explains the basics of how good sleep habits help to achieve academic and sports outcomes and improve overall well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatric medicine at Harvard Medical School and executive director of medical services at the University, explained that the university decided to introduce a course after it was found that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
An hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a room in a group where students click on coffee cups, dishes, trainers and books to learn about the influence of caffeine and light, the influence of sleep deficit on sports indicators, and the importance of sleep-related routines.
Another section tells participants how chronic sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, a compass map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the consequences of smoking cigarettes for health," added Professor Chesler.
The culture of pride for “sleeping all night” still exists, he added, and noted that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is growing.
A sufficient sleep of good quality must be the "secret weapon" of a student to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, even with a set of extra weights, because sleep deprivation translates the brain into a mode of hunger that causes constant physical hunger, he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler to develop a course after he enrolled in one of his other courses last year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, will address all graduates with a request for a similar training program to come to a competitive institution.
Professor Chesler recommends that students be reminded of the need to sleep, and also to put the building and to be in the harmful influence of the blue light, which is emitted by electronic screens and light-radio lamps, and can disrupt the circular rhythm that causes sleep problems.
"Liveington" 1 - 0 "Randers": Mengy's goal upsets the boys Gerard
Rangers have survived a round attack of foreign sadness: the Dolli Mengi hit a different team, Stephen Gerard, with a 1-0 defeat from Louiston.
The "Ibrox" team wanted to win its first victory in a foreign match after a February victory over St. Johnston with an account of 4-1, but Garry Holt's team defeated Gerard as an 18-game manager. The "Jerard" team remained at eight points behind Scottish Prime Minister Harts.
Manga killed seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers warehouse, which lacked inspiration, didn't seem to be able to compare the bill.
Now "Renders have fallen to the sixth position, and "Liveington" has risen to the third, and by the way, only "Hibernian".
In addition, Rangers may encounter another discomfort, since the Lineman Colum Spence was forced to treat the head wound after it was removed from the guest sector.
Gerard made eight changes to the team, which once passed over Air to the Dob of the Scottish League in the semifinal.
And Holt released the same "Levi 11" thing that took one eye to Harts last week, and was fascinated by how his propped-up boys pushed rivals on every step.
The Rangers may have been dominated by a ball owner, but Lionington worked more with the ball that they had received.
They had to kill everything in two minutes of the game, when the first dog Menga in the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit on the doors of Allan McGregor, but the half-defenser had made this great chance by sending the ball over the door.
A deep free blow by Keagan Jacobs caught up with Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgou hit the back of the barn
Rangers really got control, but in the last third there was more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos, of course, felt that he should be entitled to a four - hour term after the meeting with Stephen Louless, but Stephen Thompson’s report rejected the call of the Colombian.
Rangers were only able to do two knocks on the doors in the first time, but Liam Kelly's former gatekeeper, Lassani Kulibali, and the Ovija Edjaria's peaceful blow, were almost unconcerned.
And even though the Lionington goal was passed in 34 minutes, maybe he was against the game, no one can deny that they deserved it only by their hard work.
Rangers couldn't deal with Jacob's preparation again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent a ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Mango for a simple ending.
In the end, Gerard replaced the Kulibali on Ryan Kent, and this change worked almost immediately when the jinger broke into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly crawled out of his line to lock him down.
However, Lionington continued to force guests to play exactly the game that they like when Litgou and Halket make one long pass after another.
The Holt team could have improved the result in the last stages, but McGregor well opposed Jacobs before Litgou hit the corner.
Glenn Midlton, an exchange in Rangers, made a later application for a fine when he met Jacobs, but Thompson took another look.
Almanac: Geiger Counter's inventor
And now the page from our Sunday morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago this day, and the time is coming... in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as the Geiger calculator.
Since then, the Gaiger numbers have become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, for example in the 1950s, the Coronado Phones with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play suspiciously like cowboys.
The man said, “What is this?”
Rogers: "It's the Geiger counter that's used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you use these earrings, you can really hear how the radiation in the minerals affects the atoms."
Evans said, "Well, it's gonna blow up right now."
Hans Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells that are part of the treatment
Method for removing immune cells in the patient and changing them in the laboratory
Then these cells are able to "see" a protein, which is common to many cancer species, and then these cells reintroduce the patient.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells, egg cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes removing the immune cells in the patient, changing them into the laboratory so that these cells can "see" the same for many species of protein cancer (HER2), and further reintroduce these cells to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the United States Institute of Cancer Betesda, Maryland, noted: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine. ”
"HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer," including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer," he explained.
A similar approach, which is to remove the immune cells in patients and the "learn" to focus on cancer cells, has worked to treat one of the types of leukaemia.
After the SNL show at the MAGA Canye West baseball was released with a loud speech in support of President Tramp,
what caused the negative reaction of the audience
Viewers at the SNL (Sunday Night in the Straight Eiffel) studio have educated Kaniya after his summary speech, in which he praised US President Donald Trampa and claimed that he will fight for the presidential post in 2020.
After performing the third song, called Ghost Town, in the baseball game "Let's Return to America's Former Fame," he exploded with a talk that criticized the Democrats, and again declared his support for the Trump.
"Many times during the conversation, white people ask me, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist."
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America long ago," he said.
The SNL show began with a sketch by Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Cavano's testimony he gave to the Senate's Legal Committee on the Call for Christine Blaise Ford about violent acts of sexuality.
Although the West’s talk was not broadcast in the direct direction, the video with its tirade appeared on the social network of comics, Chris Rock.
It remains unclear whether Rock wanted to derail the West by placing this post.
West also complained to the viewers that he had been hit by an unpleasant situation because of the main suit.
As Washington Examiner reports, West said, "When I was behind bars, I was rudely treated.
I was told, "Don't go out to the spectators in this baseball."
They've been bullying me!
And then they tell me that I'm in a place where the depressed are silent."
Wet continued, "Do you want to see where the depressed keep quiet? I'll put on my superman baseball because nobody can tell me what to do, do you want the world to keep moving forward?
Then try to treat each other with love."
According to the Variety weekly, his comments at least twice caused a negative reaction to the audience in the hall and the SNL actors seemed to be lost.
The news last minute invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Macmiller, died a few days before the show.
The West was very surprised by the song I Love it (I love it) in the Perrier bottle suit.
The news was supported by the head of the conservative TPUSA Candes Turner, who wrote in Twitter: "One of the bravest: I HAVE TO KEEP WHAT I HAVE TO DO."
Instead, Karen Hunter's lead show wrote on Twitter that West is "who he is, and that's just great."
"But I won't reward it (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "art") who, in my opinion, bears witness and utters an ideology that harms my community.
He is a free man.
"So do we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced in Twitter that he had changed his name: now he's "the one who's known as the West Canyon."
The West is not the first performer to change his name, and he follows the example of Grandpa, also known as Paff Grandpa, Paffy and Pi Grandpa.
Dr. Snoop Dogg used to be Snoop Lion, and, as you know, Prince's musical legend has changed his name to a symbol, and then he became "Artist, formerly known as Prince."
Indicted for deliberate murder after a knife attack at the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is being charged with deliberate murder after another man has been wounded in one of the restaurants of East Belfast on Friday.
The police reported that the incident occurred at the Belligekamore restaurant.
It is expected that the accused will be brought before the court of Belfast's magistrates on Monday.
The prosecutor's office is investigating the charges.
Kit Gerington's Star of the Game of Prestables condemns the idealization of brutality
Keith Gerington became known for the role of a warrior with John Snow's sword in the brutal medieval fantasy series "Game of thrones" of the HBO.
However, a 31-year-old actor condemned the stereotype of hero-match, claiming that because of such heroes on screen young boys, they often seem to have to be cool to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Keith, he said, "Something has gone wrong," and asked how to solve the problem of the idealization of brutality in the age of #MeTo's popularity.
Keith, who recently married his colleague on the Games of Prestals, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, noted that he was "very determined" to fight this problem.
And he said, "I'm pretty determined at this point, when did we get on the path of illustrating brutality?"
"Why do we teach future men if we look at their growth because of the perception of the problem that we see now?"
Keith believes that television is partly responsible for the popularization of brutality through the image of extremely brave heroes.
He continued, "What is natural, what are we planted?
Why do you teach television and street people that young boys feel pressured to be such men?
In my opinion, today is a really important question: How do we change it?
It's obvious that the young guys have gone the right way."
In an interview, he also noted that he wouldn't be filmed in any of the preschools and the chair games after the show of the show next summer, because he's already done battles and horses.
In November, Keith will play the play "True West" by Sam Shepard, a story about a movie producer and his brother-in-law.
As the actor recently confessed, he respects his wife, Rose, the best she's ever had in the "Game of thrones" series.
"I met my wife after the video, so he gave me a future family and determined my next life," Keith said.
In a fictional series that won Amy's awards, Rose played Igritt -- the love of Hero Gerington John Snow.
The ceremony took place in June 2018 in the territory of Lesley's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a sharp increase of 14% of new cases of disease
In China, 14% of people with HIV and AIDS reported a sharp increase.
According to health authorities, more than 820,000 patients are reported in the country as a whole.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases of disease were reported.
In most cases, the disease has been transmitted by means of a sexual procedure that shows a change in the previous trend.
For a long time, in some regions of China, HIV was rapidly spreading through infected blood during transfusions.
However, according to the official health authorities at the conference in the province of Junan, the number of people infected with HIV this way has fallen to almost zero.
However, the number of HIV and AIDS patients in China increased by 100,000 compared with the previous year.
The transmission of HIV through time is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
There was a discrimination of homosexuality in China in 1997, but the LGBT community is often discriminated against.
According to the survey, between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sexual relations with other men are further married to women because of the country’s conservative values.
In most cases, transmission of the disease occurs as a result of improper use of protective devices during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to HIV drugs, thus partially solving the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects the abuse of the Republican senators on the network by her staff and exposes the harsh criticism of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, issued a loud statement that one of her officials had posted personal data of three American Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims that these statements are spread by ultra-right political viewers and websites.
"A lie, a lie, and then a more hateful lie," said Waters in Twitter.
The public information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Getcha from Utah.
The data appeared online on Thursday, and they were posted by an unknown person from the Capitol at the hearing of the Senate commission for charges of sexual misconduct against Brett Cavano, a candidate for the position of the Supreme Court of the United States.
The data flow took place some time after the three senators questioned Cavano.
The Hill reported that on conservative websites such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, information appeared that the IP address of the source is related to the Waters office and that it was able to find data from its staff member.
"These unsubstantiated claims -- absolutely false, they don't answer the facts," Waters continued.
"The co-worker of my office whose personal data and security are put at risk as a result of these manufactured and false claims, has no relation to the source of this information.
These baseless claims are absolutely false, they don't answer the facts."
Waters was quickly criticised on the network, including the former White House Press Secretary Ari Flyerser.
"It's a denial of anger," Flyers wrote.
"It suggests that in this way she cannot be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of what he has not done, there is no need to be angry.
The accused should not act presumptuously.
He should not ask about the motives of the accused.
He must remain calm and unmoveable."
It seems that Flyers had a parallel between the reaction of Waters and the criticism of the democracies to judge Cavano, who was accused of looking too angry at him on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republican Party, who is working to take the waters place in the middle of the election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"That's the news, if it's true," he wrote.
In her application, Waters noted that her office had already reported "the relevant state authorities and law enforcement authorities on these false statements".
"We will do everything possible to find the guilty," she continued, "and they have responded to the law for their actions that are harmful and dangerous to all my employees."
A review of Agent Johnny English: New Mission - a passing parade on spy fighters with Rowen Atkinson
It has already become a good tradition to look for ideas in every new British movie, which is called Brexit. There are also in a new part of a series of comedy parades for John English fighters. The first film called "Johnny English" came out on screen in 2003, and later a series was relaunched in 2011, relaunching "Johnny English: Relaunch".
Will it be a ridiculous and ironic self-satisfaction to what we are short-lived, the new export potential of the nation?
By the way, Johnny English with his movable face and his distraught eyes the second time had the opportunity to make trouble, and his name was more than anything else indicating that this comical character was created for viewers in non-English countries.
As is well known, Johnny is a cheerful secret agent who, despite his strange efforts to be gallant and charming, is a little from Inspector Clouseau, a little from Mr. Bin, and a lot of things, from the guy who played one note of the song from the movie "Fire Wheels" at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
It is also an example of a traveler and a mystery of an international scale that has always left behind the mess that Atkinson had once played in Barclaycard’s long forgotten TV commercials.
In the last film about Johnny English, there are a few good points.
I liked the scene when Johnny English in his hunting gear approached the helicopter, and the gins of the gypsy were clapping about his helmet.
It's a nice film to have Atkinson's talent set up as a buffoon, but a passing humor, and in some moments it's too much, especially when it's compared to "serious" movie brands, such as "Agent 007" and "Mission is impossible," one of the "integrators" which is also a comedy.
It seems that jokes are more likely to be on children than on adults, and I don't seem to be the kind of ingenious and thoughtless jokes that happen to Johnny English, such as Atkinson's jokes in the blind movies about Bin.
As always, the film begins with a serious threat to Britain.
The British supersecret network of spies penetrates the hacker and exposes the names of all field agents, which became a complete surprise for the active agent (unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played only an epic role in the film).
This was the last drop for Prime Minister, a proud person who has already suffered a terrible critique and is in deep depression because of the loss of popularity (Emma Thompson was trying to give the best of a picture published by Teresa May, but the script failed to fully discover it).
The investigators informed her that all active agents had been compromised, and she had to join some of the remotes.
The election falls on the unimaginable Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in a super-modern institution and informally teaches children operating undercover (in this part of the Spanish "year school" English for teenagers was several long jokes).
English is quickly being delivered to Whitegol for a term briefing, where he meets again with his sufferer friend Buff, who plays Ben Miller in turn.
Buff is now married to the captain of the submarine (the role of an excellent nurturing person does not entirely correspond to the talent of Vicky Pepperdin).
So, when everything in the Secret Service of Her Majesty went to Scarebert, "Bethman and Robin" returned to the stream and suddenly met the fatal woman of Ophelia Pistoletto, who was playing by Olga Kurileenko.
And then the Prime Minister comes under the charismatic billionaire's spell, who has earned his stock in the field of technology and technology, and claims that he can remove the problem with the British network, the charismatic Jason Walt, who played Jake Lacey.
The English and Buff go on their journeys and go back to their comical wastes: refurbished by the officers, they make fires at a skirmish French restaurant; they continue to sow chaos, illegally going abroad on the beautiful island of Volta; the English is making a real mess when trying to use the helmet of virtual reality to get to know Volta's planning.
All the stops lead us to the last episode, but with his kindness and modesty he reminds us of a movie for children.
Passive film.
As with other movies about Johnny English, I asked myself the same question: Can't the British film industry offer Rowen Atkinson a role that really meets his talent?
Laborists refuse to prepare a plan that says that British work four days a week, but they'll get a payout in five days.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbin has to discuss a radical plan that British people will work four days a week, but they will be paid in five days.
It's reported that the party wants to oblige the company's leaders to transfer the costs saved as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution, to the workers, giving them an additional output.
In this way, workers will have a three - day weekend, bringing the same pay home.
According to sources, this idea will respond to the party's economic program and direct the country's resources to support the working class.
The four-week shift was approved at the British Congress of Tread Unions, and this is a way that workers can benefit from changing the overall economic situation.
The Labour Party's source reported the Sunday Times: "The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
It's not all going to change in one night, but the idea of a four-week working week is that the party's approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of workers and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labourers did not first approve this idea, as the Green Party promised to conduct a four-day work week even during the 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, not all members of the Labour Party at this time approve of such a desire.
The Labour Party Speaker said, "The party's political programme does not provide for a four-day work week, so we're not going to consider this idea right now."
The Young Chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy at the pre-election rally of the Labour Party last week.
Mr. McDonnell stated that the planned withdrawal of authority from the "unsanitary directors" of municipal companies and "seekers" was planned.
It also means that water supply company shareholders can get not all their share of the capital if the Laborist government conducts "recording" on the basis of imaginary violations.
He also confirmed the intention to include employees in company governance and to create inclusive equity funds to transfer 10% of ordinary shares to private sector firms that expect annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell us at the 60-minute show if Kawano, the head of the FBI, could change their mind.
In connection with the investigation of charges against Judge Brett Cavano, led by the FBI, the final vote for his appointment as Judge of the Supreme Court has been postponed for at least a week.
At Sunday's 60-minute show, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
At the hearing, I told him that I had a conversation with Judge Cavano.
I called him after everything happened and the charges came out, and I asked him, "Did you really do that?"
He was decisive, firm, uncompromising."
It seems that Greema's thought will not change anything.
"I think the Kawano indictment is a provocation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know what: Brett firmly denied everything," added Graham, addressing Christine Blaise Ford.
And anyone she calls can't confirm it under oath.
That happened 36 years ago.
I don't understand what might change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and how can it affect poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will be hosted by the Global Citizen Festival (World Citizens' Festival), an annual event in the music world with an amazing number of star performers and no less exciting mission, to combat poverty worldwide.
At the seventh Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will march into the Grand Central Park, not only to enjoy the talks of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real purpose of the festival – organizers will seek to combat the extreme form of poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is the continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international public organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you don't want to pay a VIP ticket), visitors have to do a lot of tasks or "acts", like learning in a volunteer project, writing an e-mail to the world leader, making a phone call or anything else to help focus on the organization's goal of eradicating poverty.
So are there any results already, since the goal of Global Citizen organizers has been 12 years?
Is the idea really to reward for doing a free concert -- the brilliant way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "clitivism" when people feel that they really change something by signing an electronic petition or making a publication on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have recorded 19 million "acts" of their supporters aimed at achieving different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have motivated world leaders to declare planned financial allocations and programs of more than $37 billion, which will help to change lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group provided an example of 390 financial commitments and public statements, with at least 10 billion already collected and spent.
According to a group, the cost has already directly affected some 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main financial commitments is the The Power of Nutrition Fund, which is territorially related to Britain. As part of the project, investors and realists have undertaken to "help children grow" and have promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help cope with the problem of malnutrition after more than 4700 messages have been received on Twitter from Global Citizens.
"In support of the government of Britain, the mesenatas, the governments of other countries and the citizens of the world, such as you, we can make a social problem of undernourished by a minor fact of history," said The Power of Nutrition Tracy Ullman, a representative of the organization, speaking before the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5,000 "acts" that called for improvements in the diet of mothers and children, the British government announced spending on the The Power of Nutrition project aimed at improving the nutrition of 5 million mothers and children.
In answer to one of the common questions on your website, "Why do you think you can tackle the extreme level of poverty?"
The representatives of Global Citizen wrote: "This is a long and difficult path, so sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like participants in civil rights and against apartheid, we will achieve success because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, The Weekend Group, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Jeannell Mona, is just a part of the star performers that will be held this year at the New York Festival, and will be held by Deborah Lee Fernness and Guy Jackman.
Minister of Home Affairs stated that the United States could use military and maritime forces to "block" to prevent the export of Russian energy
According to the U.S. Minister of Home Affairs, Ryan Zinke, quoted in Washington Examiner, "for the sake of necessity" Washington, can be approached by military and maritime forces to prevent the outflow of Russian energy to markets, including the Middle East markets.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s participation in the conflict in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government, is an incentive to explore new energies.
"I think they're staying in the Middle East because they want to become a mediator in energy trade, as they are already doing in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
"With the U.S. military and maritime forces, it is possible to ensure a free passage through the sea routes and, if necessary, to block them so that Russian energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants in the event, which was conducted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-commercial organization that positions itself as "the voice of every consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare trade approaches with Russia and Iran, noting that they were actually similar.
"The economic strategy for Iran and Russia is generally that we effectively use energy resources and replace them with alternatives," he said, calling Russia "one-sided", because its economy depends on mineral energy sources.
While these claims were being made, the Tramp administration aimed at increasing the export of compressed natural gas to Europe by pushing off the Russian energy market, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
For this purpose, Tramp administration officials and President Donald Tramp themselves are trying to convince the German government to reject the "unsuitable" project of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Tramp, will make Berlin a Moscow hostage.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 gas, which is worth 11 billion dollars, will double the existing gas capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, a purely economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington is stepping up against the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
"In my view, we share the idea that energy cannot be a pressure tool and a consumer should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry, who took place in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position called for a negative response from Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German lead organization of the German Federation of German Industry (BDI) called for the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like it when a third country intervenes in our supply of energy," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Association of German Industry, after the last meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren's "seriously thinking" about running for the president's post in 2020
The senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that "he's thinking seriously" about going to the president's office after the interim elections.
At a meeting with the public in Goliak, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the possibility of his candidacy.
As The Hill Warren reports, "It's time for women to go to Washington and set up a government, and for that to be his head, there must be a woman."
"On November 6th, I'm seriously thinking about moving my candidacy to the post of president."
At a meeting with the public, Warren expressed his appreciation of Donald Trump's presidency, saying he "runs his country not in that direction.
"I'm extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was open, criticizing the Trump and offering him a candidate for the position of the Supreme Court judge, Brett Cavano.
On Friday's tweet, Warren wrote, "No doubt, before the FBI vote, the investigation is to be conducted."
However, according to the polls published on Friday, the majority of the Warren voters do not believe that it should be fought in 2020.
According to the survey conducted jointly by the Saffol University Political Research Centre and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the potential voters of the state of Massachusetts expressed opposition to the senator's candidacy.
Thirty - two percent supported the move.
The survey found that the former governor, Deval Patrick, was more supportive. He was 38%, compared to 48%.
During the discussion of the nominations of other known democracies, which can be fought in 2020, they also refer to former vice president Joe Baiden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Byden claimed that he would make a decision by January.
Sara Pailin mentions the PTSR Trek Pailin during a meeting to support Donald Tramp
26-year-old Trek Pailin spent a year in Iraq after entering military service in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my son is going through right now, what he's going through after he's back, can only be understood by other families that are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and other health problems that our soldiers are returning home with," she said in front of the meeting in support of Donald Trump in Tals, Oklahoma.
Pailin called Trek's arrest "a problem that no one pays attention to" and said that her son and other war veterans "are not returning home as they used to be, more cruel, and want to know if they respect here what they've done to their soldiers, pilots and other military personnel for this country."
According to a spokesman for the Vasilla Police Department, Dan Bennett, Treka was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence and assaulting women, as well as of obstructing reports of violence and carrying arms in a state of alcohol abuse.
18 States and the District of Colombia Support the Prosecution of Home Affairs Policy
Eighteen states and the province of Colombia support the accusation of a new U.S. policy that the victims of gang persecution and domestic violence are denied refugee status.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the district sent an analytical note to a court consultant in Washington to support the caller who needed shelter and complained about the policy in the court order.
The full name of the appeal in the Grace v. Seshns case after the call of the American Union for the protection of civil rights, in which the federal policy is being accused and which was filed in August, is not being disclosed.
The invitation stated that her partner "and his cruel sons-in-laws" were hers, but the U.S. officials refused her when she asked for shelter on July 20th.
She was held illegally in Texas.
Public prosecutors who support Grace said that the people of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala (those who often ask for shelter in the United States) often face serious problems, such as gangs and domestic violence.
The new refugee status policy reverses the decision of the Immigration Appeals Board in 2014, according to which non-documented immigrants who have escaped domestic violence could apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Colombia, General Carl Reesein, said in his speech on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring the decade of state, federal and international laws."
"Federal law requires a decision on the application of refugee status to be based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and the prohibition violates this principle," the Court's analysis notes.
In the review note, prosecutors further argue that a policy that prohibits immigrants from entering the United States would harm the economies of the country, as they can potentially become entrepreneurs and "fill the necessary labour resources".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Seshens issued an order for immigration judges, stating that they could no longer give refugee status to those fleeing domestic violence and vandalism.
"The protocol is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with racial affiliation, religion, nationality, membership in certain public groups or political views," Seshns said in his speech on 11 June.
The provision of shelter was never intended to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescuers desperately try to find those who are left alive, while the number of dead in Pala has increased by two.
For those left alive, the situation continues to deteriorate.
"The situation is very tense," says a 35-year-old mother, calming her boy with a fever in the evacuation center of the ruined city of Pala.
"Every minute a quick help brings the body.
There's not enough clean water."
Some people return to their ruined homes, take over the submerged benefits, and try to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people have been traumatized, and hospitals damaged by an earthquake, with 7.5 points of power on Richter’s scale, are overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Geriss with a fracture of their back and shoulders, rest at the building of the Pala’s army hospital, where patients are helped under the open sky through constant retrieval.
His eyes were filled with tears as he remembered how a strong mail came into his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time for salvation.
I think I've been stuck in the middle of a wall," Heris told Associated Press correspondent, adding that he and his family had come to the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife praying for help and then panicked quietly.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "exacting psychological pressure" with "advertising propaganda"
A week later, after the Chinese State newspaper posted on four pages of the daily U.S. edition ad on the mutual benefit of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread the propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday sent a pay-up to China Daily's Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of trying to influence elections to the Congress, which will take place on November 6th, China rejects these charges.
According to the U.S. Reuters agency, Trampa, in which he accused Beijing of trying to get involved in the U.S. elections, refers to a new phase of escalation on the part of Washington, whose goal is to pressure China.
Although foreign governments can place a commercial to boost trade, there is a time-bound escalation of trade wars between Beijing and Washington, where they have already raised import duties.
According to experts from China and the U.S., at the beginning of this war, the imposition of a repressive customs in China was aimed at hitting exporters from such states as Iowa, who supported the Republic of Trump.
Terry Brenstead, a US ambassador in China and former Governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural production to China, claimed that China had caused damage to American workers, farmers, and companies.
China, as Brenstead wrote in a column on the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, "enforces pressure by publishing an advertisement containing propaganda in our independent press."
"In order to spread the propaganda, the Chinese government is using the road for the American people's tradition of freedom of speech and independence of the press by placing a pay ad in the Des Moines Register," Brenstead wrote.
"On the contrary, on the street schedules here in Beijing, you will only find different voices, and here you will not see a true picture of what the Chinese people actually think about the direction of the Chinese economy, which is causing concern, which can lead to the conclusion that the Chinese media are under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the important Chinese editions offered to publish" his article, but he didn't call it what it was.
Analysts warn that by a failure from Cavano, the Republicans set up female voters against themselves before the intermediate elections.
Since many well - known Republicans support and protect the candidate in the position of the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano after several charges have been brought against him in sexual harassment, analysts warn that this may cause an unwanted reaction to the previous interim elections, especially in women.
In this situation, prejudice is rampant, and most Republicans publicly claim that they would like to go to the poll.
These things can't be played back," said Grant Ridger, professor of politics at Maxwell University of Syracuse, during an interview with The Hill on Saturday.
Riger expressed doubts that the FBI investigation, at which the last minute Senator Jeff Fleeck (Republic of Arizona) began to press, would be enough to calm the angry voters.
According to Washington, D.C., the main advisor and speaker of the MoveOn (Move on) progressive group Katrin Jean-Perrye said on Friday: "Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget about it tomorrow or November."
According to Mic, on Friday morning, the protestors sang "The Fall is approaching!" during a demonstration in the Legal Committee, when the Republicans decided to move to the approval of the Kawano candidate, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
In an interview with the news website of St. Rothenberg, a post-partisan political observer, he said, "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
"They're saying it's true now, and it's true.
However, motivation may be enhanced, especially in women from 18 to 29 years of age, with priorities that have not yet been defined and often do not vote unless they like the president."
Even before Ford gave a witness in connection with the charges against the Supreme Court's position as a sexual criminal judge, analysts predicted a negative voter response if the Republicans insisted on a statement.
According to NBC News, earlier this week's former head of the National Committee of the Republican Party Michael Steel said, "It's an unpleasant story for the Republican Party."
As stated in an interview with the news channel, the director of Priorities USA (priorities of the United States) (a group that assists in the pre-election campaign of the Democrats) Guy Cecil, "the matter is not in the vote of the committee, the final vote, or that the Kawano was in the backseat, and how they responded to this situation and how they acted on it."
Yet, the views of the Americans about whose testimony to believe, Ford or Cavano, have been divided, and ford has a little more support.
According to a new survey by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe in or believe in the Ford testimony, while 35% believe in the testimony of Kavano.
In addition, 38 percent of the respondents noted that they thought that the Cavano had given or rather had given false testimony, while 30 percent of the respondents had said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, after Flemish Flemish Flemish's pressure, the Flemish FBI is conducting an investigation of the charges filed by Ford and another caller, Debor Ramirez.
Last week, Ford gave a witness under the oath of the Senate Legal Committee about how Kawano attacked her while she was in an alcoholic state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez stated that a candidate for the position of a Supreme Court judge showed her her genitals at a party during their education at Elsa University in the 1980s.
A world-wide network inventor plans to launch "New Internet" to create Google and Facebook competition
Team Berners-Li, an inventor of the Internet, launches a new startup to create Facebook, Amazon and Google competition.
The latest project of the world's technology legend, the Inrupt company, is to develop a platform with an open source code of Solid, the idea of which belongs to Berners-Li.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where to store data and to give access to that or other information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Li, he joked that the goal of Inrupt is "world domination."
"We must do it now," he said about the start-up.
It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that will enable users to create "Personal Online Data Storage" or POD.
It can store contact lists, mailing lists, calendars, audio recordings library, and other tools for your own use and work.
It's like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify in one browser at a time.
The unique feature of this personal data repository is that it fully meets the needs of the user who can access any information.
The company calls it "the expansion of personal capabilities through data".
According to Director General Inrupt John Bruce, the company aims to activate resources, processes and appropriate skills to make the Solid platform accessible to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Li, Bruce, security platforms acquired in IBM, several state developers hired to work on the project, and the volunteer software community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own autonomous applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't negotiate with Facebook and Google about whether to make a full replacement when all their business models undergo radical changes within a short period of time.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a Saturday publication on Medium Berners-Li, he wrote that the mission of Inrupt was "to secure commercial energy and the ecosystem and to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Li transformed the Internet into a Consortium of the World Paputin at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last months, Berners-Li is an influential figure in the debate on net neutrality.
Even at the launch of the Inrupt Berners-Li, he remained the founder and director of the World Pavilion Consortium, the Fund of the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next era of network development," said Berners-Li.
Bernard Vann: Celebration from the ceremony of the Church of the Order of the Cross of Victoria in the Year of World War I
The only representative of the Anglican Church who received the Order of the Cross of Victoria for participation in the war in World War I is honored in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann received the award for his participation in the attack under the Belgian and Leoquor on September 29, 1918.
However, he died four days later from the sniper’s bullet, and he never learned that he had received Britain’s highest military award.
On Saturday, two of his grandsons discovered a memorial stone during a parade in the town of Rassden, the county of Nordgemptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, called it "extremely symbolic" that the discovery of a memorial stone took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather accomplished the honour for which he was rewarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Vann transferred his battalion through St. Katten's channel "through a very dense fog and under a heavy fire of field weapons and bullets."
Later, he rushed to the fire border and with the "extensive courage" he made a strong move, before which one went to the field gun and destroyed the three weapons of the enemy compartment.
Lieutenant Vanna shot a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little more than a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said that his grandfather did what he could never do himself and deserved respect.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, put the shadow behind the parade under the leadership of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he feels very proud of being involved in this parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero shows the respect that so many people show him."
MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead showed them "Peppo Pig"
Imagine that you're not sleeping all night just to watch the events of Bellator 206, and you're denied the opportunity to review the main event.
There were 13 battles in the São José tournament, including six main program units that were broadcast live in the nighttime in Britain on 5 channels.
At six o'clock in the morning, just before Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were ready to get together, TV viewers in the United Kingdom died of a miracle when Peppa's pig appeared on the screen instead of the transmission of the war.
Some observers were not attracted to this because they did not sleep until the morning before waiting for the battle.
One of the fans wrote in Twitter that the switch to a child's movie was made to him "some sort of failed joke."
"According to the government's decision, the content broadcast at 6 a.m. was inappropriate, so they were forced to release a child's transmission," said Dave Schwarz, the senior vice president of marketing and public relations with Bellator, when asked about television,
"Peppa pig," yes."
Bellator Scott Kocker, president of the company, promised to work on the broadcasting schedule to catch up with the future audiences in Britain.
"I think that if we talk about retranslation, we'll be able to set it up," Cooker said.
"But now there's Sunday, 6:00 in the morning, and we can't do anything until we have Sunday, and they have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was turned off, we received a lot of the messages we responded to, and the text of these messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical flaw, and we tried to remove it.
However, it was found to be a lack of compliance with government regulations.
I can promise you that's not going to happen anymore.
We're going to cut the tournament down to five fights instead of six, as usual, and we were trying to reinstate the signal for fans, but until these attempts have been delayed.
It's a really unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Dale felt worse than others because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic stripper in Tom Dale’s water tells us that he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't understand that "not all look like him," until he went to high school.
Taking part in the Desert Island Discs transmission on Radio 4, led by Lauren Lavern, he noted that he openly spoke about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also claimed that because of his parents, he had become less concerned with winning the Olympics.
The director, who has been conducting this program for a long time, Kirsty Young, went to the hospital for a few months.
When he came to Lavern's first show, Dale said he felt "bader" than others when he was a child, because "the society didn't accept when someone liked boys and girls."
He said, "By this time, the feeling of minorities and differences was what gave me strength and strength to achieve success."
According to him, he wanted to prove something "wary," not to disappoint anyone who finally learned about his orientation.
A twice-breeding bronze Olympic knight became a famous fighter for the law of the LBGT community and took advantage of this year's Society Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke openly about his views, because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give this "hope" to others.
The world’s triangular champion acknowledged that his feelings for a man, American film director Dustin Lans Black, whom he met in 2013, were a real surprise to him.
Dale took Oscar’s award winner, who was 20 years older than him, last year, but he said that the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you're going through so much in such a young age" (in the first Olympics he went out at 14 years of age, and in three years his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone of his age who'd also survive a similar flight and fall.
In June, there was a son named Robert Ray Black-Dale, and since then, according to Dale, his "acceptance" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I'd just think about what to get the gold," he said.
"You know, things are much more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Dale said that his father could not reconcile himself with the idea of the end and asked if they had bought tickets at the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be sitting in the first row because you won't be there anymore," said Dale.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Dale took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life: to pry in front of my fellow students at the Olympic Games, and there was no feeling better than that," Daily said.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song — Proud (Gordia) in the performance of Gizer Small, which was resonated with him during the preparations for the Olympic Games and still calls for ants.
The Desert Island Disks program is released on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m.
On Saturday with the winner of the "Cube Rider" tournament, Michaelson was released, who was not in shape.
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th game at the Cup Rider tournament, but he has to restore the shape so that this event doesn't turn out to be a bad thing for him.
Mikelson, who took part in a two-year-old tournament on record 12th, took Captain Jim Furick out of the game to play for the purposes of the games.
Instead of staying in the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, a five-time winner encouraged the team all day and trained on the side, hoping to manage emotions.
Since Mikelson wasn't famous for his good hits even at the top of his career, a 48-year-old sportsman didn't come up with a difficult golf course for Le Golf National, where the Raf is usually punishing for the wandering hits.
And if that's not the case, on Sunday, at the ninth match, Michaelson will have to meet with the champion of the Open Championship and master of the exact hit of Francesco Molinari, who won all of his matches this week in a couple with the new Tommy Flethwood.
If the Americans, who stay three times after the 12 single match, start well, the Mikelson match can be decisive.
Furick expressed confidence in his sportsman, and he probably had nothing to add to it.
"He finally understood his role today, he slapped me in the back, hugged me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Furick said.
"He does not doubt his powers.
Michaelson, a member of the Hall of Fame, who did so much for the teams last week and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play in two matches.
I've been predicting more matches, but that's how it worked, so we decided to do it.
He wants to be there, in the field, like anyone else."
If Mikelson goes out on Saturday, he's gonna beat Nick Faldo's record, who played the biggest match in the Cup Rider tournament.
He may have completed his career at the Cup of Ryder tournament, which never met his individual achievement.
Michaelson's 18 wins, 20 defeats, and 7 nobody's results, but Furik said his presence can play a crucial role for the team.
"He's funny, he's fat, he's fat, he likes to joke with others, he's a guy who's classy in the team," Furick explained.
"I think the younger players were having a good time coming to him and this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He's more than just a player."
The captain of the European team, Thomas Byrne, knows that the big cut doesn't make a decision.
Thomas Byron, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great cut in front of the lonely players on the last day of the tournament for "Cubok Ryder" does not yet guarantee victory.
In 1997, Datchanin competed in a match at the Valderram Club, where a team headed by his Ballesteros was ahead of the Americans at five points, but won the match with a minor draw with a score of 141:13 1⁄2.
"You remember that we had a big crack in the game in the Valderram field; a big crack in Bruklein where we lost, and in the Valderram field where we won the game," said Byorn after viewing the winning games Class 2018 with the result of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at the Le Golf National Stadium, after which the crack is 10:6.
So history teaches me and every team player that nothing has been decided yet.
We have to play with the maximum performance tomorrow.
Get out of the field and do whatever you need to do.
The game will be finished only after the result appears on the table.
We have the goal of getting this trophy, and that's what we want.
As I said earlier, I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we are well aware of who will oppose us as the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of my players in the complex field, Byorn added, "I will never run ahead.
It'll be different tomorrow.
We're expecting individual match-ups tomorrow, and that's something else.
It's good to play in the field with your partner when it's all right, but it's when you're standing there alone, and you can see what you're worth as a golfer.
Here's how to set players out tomorrow: on the edge of the possibilities.
You leave your partner without support, and now he has to show you what he's capable of."
Unlike Byorna, the opposite number, Jim Furik, expects his best-playing partners at an individual level, with the exception of Jordan Spyt and Justin Thomas, who took three eyes from four.
For the last day, Furick returned to different sides: he was among the winners in Bruklain, but he was defeated when a team from Europe created "The Wonder in Medina".
"I remember every curse word," he said in answer to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 team, organized players before the last day of the game.
"We've got 12 important players tomorrow, but we need to start successfully, like it was in Bruclain and Medina.
When the initiative moves toward one side, players in the middle of the distance face a special pressure.
We put players in the team, like we're going to, like, do something amazing tomorrow."
Thomas is assigned to try to lead a counterattack against Rory McCillroy, and then in the first half of the list of European teams, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fletwood and Ian Poulter.
"Only these partners, and in this order, I have chosen because I want to share effort evenly throughout the game," Byorn commented on his selection of players for individual matches.
The introduction of a new German battleship has been postponed
Germany's most recent military-marriage fleet had to launch in 2014 instead of the old Cold War courts. However, local media reports indicate that this will not happen until at least next year because of inadequate systems and a sharp increase in costs.
According to the Die Zeit newspaper, received from the military intelligence spokesman, the launch of the Rhineland-Pfaltz, the main vessel of the latest series of Frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019.
This ship was to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery were detrimental to the implementation of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wurttemberg ships, which military and maritime knowledge has ordered in 2007, have to replace the old bridges of the Bremen.
It is clear that they will be equipped with powerful weapons, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some of the technologies that reduce the visibility, including radiolocation, infrared and acoustic.
Another important feature is the long period of technical security, which is expected to be able not to return to the base port for about two years.
However, journalists Die Zeit warns that because of the constant delay in the operation of modern military ships that were to strengthen Germany’s military power at sea, the time of entry into service will also be extended.
The F125 heavy-duty fregat got into the headline of the turquoise newspaper when the German naval forces officially refused to launch the ship and returned it to the Blohm + Voss Verf in Hamburg.
This is the first case of the return of the military ship to the shipyard after delivery.
The reasons for the return are not known, but the German media mentioned significant "programming and equipment defects", which made the warship unfit for military operations.
The lack of software is particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg ship's crew is made up of about 120 sailors -- only half of the army that served on the old Bremen frigates.
In addition, it has been found that the ship has a significant excess of weight, which increases its performance and limits the possibilities for further modernization.
It's considered that the Rhineland-Pfaltz fragment is twice as heavy (7,000 tons) as the ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the wrong equipment, another problem has become the total cost of the project, which also includes the cost of crew training.
The expected $2.2 billion was turned into a huge $3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The problems of getting new frigates have gained special weight in the light of recent warnings of the defeat of the German military and maritime forces.
At the beginning of the year, the newly authorized Bundestag of the Hans-Peter Bartelles Armed Forces reported that the country 'was left with the VMS "a handful of ships suitable for fighting".
The officer claimed that the situation had worsened for some time, since the old vessels were out of operation and the new ones were not coming.
He said he was deeply sorry that none of the Baden-Wurttemberg Frigates could fill the military-sea fleet.
National Trust Will Observe the Secret Life of the Bats
A new survey carried out in Scotland's top land area is aimed at establishing how the bats use the landscape in search of food.
Scientists hope that the data received will help shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to carry out their conservation measures in the future.
In the gardens of Inver in West-Rossi, scientists of Scotland's National Trust will observe such species as netopria carlic and netopia pigments, as well as normal and watery nights.
Special registries will be placed in strategic locations on land management to monitor the behavior of bats during the season.
Workers and volunteers of Scotland’s National Trust will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
An expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to establish the frequency and the type of noise that the bats screams.
Then it's planned to develop a detailed animal residence map and prepare a report to link animal behavior to their habitat.
Rob Dur, a consultant on the protection of nature in Scotland's National Trust, hopes that research results will help determine which areas of life are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of environmental management measures (e.g., the formation of humans) and determine the best conservation methods for bats and other associated species.
During the last century, the population of bats decreased considerably in Scotland and in Britain.
They are threatened by the active construction and construction of areas that deprive them of their nesting sites.
Other negative factors include wind and lighting, rocking paper for flies, chemical processing of building materials, and domestic attacks.
The sentences are not actually blind.
However, by hunting at night, their ears are more effective than their eyes.
They use a complex ecolocation method to detect insects and obstacles to the flight path.
In Scotland’s National Trust, which is managed by more than 270 historic buildings, 38 special - interest gardens, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land across the country, the problem of bats is very serious.
Ten specially trained experts carry out regular research, screening of nesting sites, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization's efforts have even created the first and only battalion container in Scotland, which is located in the territory of Triv in the Damfris-and-Gallow area, where it has found shelters of eight of the ten battalions living in Scotland.
David Thompson, the manager of the premises, claims that this is an ideal place for them.
"In the territory of Triv's beautiful conditions for bats," he assures.
"There are old buildings, lots of giant trees and other favourable living conditions.
But we need to learn a lot more about the bats, and because of the research we're doing here and elsewhere, we can learn more about what they need to prosper."
He insists that it is very important to check the territory for bats before any technical work is done, because because of the unintentional destruction of one nesting site for the young can kill up to 400 males with babies, which is likely to cause the destruction of the entire local population.
The sentence and its nests are protected by law. The animal is forbidden to kill, torture or trouble.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Conservatory Center, called on the public to join the organization’s efforts.
She said, "We need to learn a lot more about our bats, and we have not yet discovered the characteristics of the populations of many species."
Ronaldo rejects charges of rape, and his lawyers prepare appeals against the German edition
Christian Ronald called the charge of rape a "uncle" and claimed that people "try to pay attention," using his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a call against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published suspicious information.
American Kathryn Mayorg accused the Forvard of collecting Portugal and the Juventus football club in a 2009 rape in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
As Der Spiegel reported on Friday, Ronald seemed to have paid her 375,000 dollars in silence.
A few hours after the 33-year-old Ronald's indictments, he addressed 142 million of his fans in videocasting in Instagram, calling them the "uncle" message.
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's accusations are slander," said the golden ball leader on the camera five times.
"They want to draw attention to themselves, using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to live with me, but similar situations are part of my work.
I'm a happy man and I'm fine," added the footballer, smiling.
According to the information agency Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are preparing calls against Der Spiegel for published charges, which they called "an unacceptable message of suspicion in private life".
A lawyer named Christian Shertz said that a footballer would claim compensation for "moral damage to the extent that corresponds to the seriousness of a violation which is probably one of the most prominent cases of personal rights violations in recent years."
It is claimed that the recorded incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after a meeting at a nightclub in Ronaldo and Majorga, they returned to the player’s room, where he seemed to have raped her, and such a witness was given to the district court of Clarke County, Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident described by Ronald, he fell on his knees and said that he was a "99 percent good boy," which he raised "one percent."
As noted in the documents, Ronald confirmed that he had sex with a model, but with mutual consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and then to the hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later she agreed to a post-trial settlement because she was afraid of revenge and warned of "public humiliation."
Now, a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel the previous deal, because she continues to suffer because of an incident that she said had a place.
At the time of Ronald's recorded incident, he was preparing to move to the Royal Madrid FC from Manchester United, and this summer he became a player of the Italian football band, the Yventus team, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain "will forever harm" about the loss of car manufacturers
Great Britain will be "damaged forever" if it loses its world leader's status in the field of auto manufacturing after Brexit.
He added that he was approved by Toyota UK, who reported to BBC journalists that in the event of Britain leaving the EU without a contract, the company would have to suspend its production and work in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," says Minister Clark.
The Japanese auto manufacturer claimed that the consequences of delays in the cordon in the case of Brexit without a contract can cost jobs.
The factory in Bernaston, where Toyota models Auris and Avensis are produced, released about 150,000 cars, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my view, if Britain leaves the EU extraordinarily at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped," said Marvin Cook, Director General Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about how Britain comes out of the EU without an international trade agreement.
For example, BMW stated that a factory from the production model Mini in Oxford would be closed a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the car manufacturers are that Brexit can cause a risk to supply chains without a contract.
The Toyota line is operating in the process of supplying details and materials according to the need: the details come every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for cars manufactured on order.
If, on March 29, Britain leaves the EU without a contract, there may be a gap in the supply of details that will lead to delays and material shortages.
As noted in the company, Toyota has no more than one day's content, so the production will have to be stopped.
Greg Clark noted that in terms of the EU's relationship with Teresa May (Chequers Plan), "a scheme to avoid problems on the border is provided."
"We need an agreement, we need to make an optimal agreement that, in my opinion, will not only be able to achieve success at the present time, but also benefit from the prospects that have emerged," he said during the Today program in the e-mail of BBC Radio 4.
"In view of Toyota's representatives and other car manufacturers, we need to keep a high-performance supply chain in place."
Toyota was unable to report how long production would be stopped, but in the long term, it is expected that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and, as a result, reduce jobs.
Peter Cwalaris, head of the United Professional Association at the Bernaston plant, which worked here for 24 years, said that other participants were extremely concerned: "I can tell from experience that the reduced jobs are not being restored."
The representative of the government said, "We have put forward a precise and reliable plan to shape our future relations with the EU."
The Trump and Rosenstein meeting can be postponed again, marked in the White House
As White House representatives reported Sunday, Donald Tramp's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "deposit for another week", as long as discussions are held on the motion for a Brett Cavano motion for office of Judge of the Supreme Court.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Muller, who investigates Russia's involvement in elections, the links between Trump and Russia's assistants and the potential violation of justice by the President.
In Washington, D.C., for a few months, the possibility of being released by a deputy attorney of the Attorney General is being discussed, which would endanger Muller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken out of using microphones to record talks with Trump and the possibility of a tight end to the President's office as amended 25th.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday he visited the White House on the ground reports that the official is going to retire.
Instead of this meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations headquarters in New York, he was appointed on Thursday.
Trump said "I wouldn't want" to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate's Legal Committee, which was to give testimony to Cavana and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaze Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation into Kawano's charges, which further suspended the Senate vote.
Press Secretary Trampa, Sarah Sanders, took a show on Fox News Sunday.
When she asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date of the meeting is not scheduled, and maybe it will take place this week, and I expect it to be postponed for another week, given all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I keep track of the latest information in the press."
Some reporters disagreed with this: Sanders did not conduct a briefing for the media in the White House on September 10th.
The leader, Chris Walles, asked why.
Sanders replied that the occasional briefings were not about incarceration for the public game on the part of television reporters, although she added, "I won't be able to deny that they were playing on the audience."
Then she assumed that Trump himself would communicate with the press more.
"The President answers questions more often than any president to him," she added, without referring to the source, "Statistics speaks for themselves."
Sanders said the briefings would always be held, but "if there's a chance in the press to ask the President of the United States, it's better than talking to me."
We're often trying to communicate with the press, and this should be particularly noticeable over the last few weeks, and the opportunity to talk to the president of the United States is not worse than the press conference."
The tramp regularly answers questions during interventions outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences for the participation of high-level guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why it was so, acting in front of journalists, and sometimes amazed.
State Secretary for Health Protection of Scotland sent a letter to EU workers in connection with fear through Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health addressed the citizens of other EU countries working in Scotland's National Health Protection Service to express their gratitude for their work and ask for it to continue after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The government of Scotland has already assumed its obligation to cover the cost of the application for permanent residence status for EU citizens working in autonomous state services.
In her letter, Mrs Fremen said: "The negotiations between Britain and the EU over the years on the issue of exit have been taking place, and it is now time to wait for the appropriate decisions to be taken.
But the British government is strengthening its preparation for possible termination without agreement.
I know that this period can be very worrying for you.
That is why I would like to stress again how I appreciate the contribution of each employee regardless of nationality.
Members from all over the European Union and countries abroad share valuable experience and skills by strengthening and improving the health care service for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we want you to stay."
Christian Ebercromby underwent a terminal surgery after a head injury
"Tennessie State Tigers," Christio Ebercrombi, who had completed a term operation after receiving a head injury in a Sunday match against "Vanderbilt Komodores" which his team had lost with an account at 31:27.
The chief coach of the Tennessee State Tigers team told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
"He went to the side line where he got sick," said Reed.
On the side of the train and medical staff, Ebercromby was given oxygen before taking it to carry it for further examination.
The official representative of the Tennessee State Tigers team reported to Chris Harris from the WSMV channel, Nashville, Tennessee, that Ebercromby was operating at the University of Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "until there's a witness about the type and severity of the trauma," "Tennessie State Tigers" is trying to find out when the player got the trauma.
Ebercromby, a second-class student, spent his first season at Tennessee State Tigers after moving from Illinois.
He did five rounds of ball on Sunday before he got out of the game, so for the season he had 18 rounds.
Foreign buyers will pay more government fees if they acquire real estate in Britain
Foreign buyers will pay more fees if they acquire real estate in Britain.
This move neutralises all Corbin's attempts to join young voters
The above - quoted government customs will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The Ministry of Finance expects an additional 120 million sterlings per year to help the homeless
As Teresa May announced today, foreign buyers in Britain will pay more money, and additional costs will be spent on helping the homeless.
This step can be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to involve young voters in making promises to provide more affordable housing for highly paid workers.
The increase in customs applies to the physical and legal persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom. The additional costs of the government are directed to help those who are forced to sleep under the open sky.
An additional fee, accompanied by a two - year - old raise to the second dwelling and the real estate assigned to the rent, may be three percent.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to add an additional 120 million pounds a year.
According to experts, 13% of the new real estate built in London is owned by foreign citizens, which leads to higher prices and complicates the task of those who just dream about their own home.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, are empty because a large number of foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country.
The new plan of action appeared only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a lower government fee to make the home more accessible to young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices for real estate by collecting the land without further use, and he called on Teresa May to refuse the quota for the real estate available to correct the "hungry situation on the housing market" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of important reforms in the area of real estate, including the control of rent and the possibility of eviction without serious grounds.
He also suggests extending the authority of local councils in the area of the construction of a new dwelling.
Theresa May said, "This year I promised to dedicate my premierity to the restoration of the British dream - for every new generation of life, it must be better.
This calls for changes in our imperfect home market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build their future here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in Britain and foreign companies purchase housing on the same terms as British citizens.
For too many people the dream of their own home has become unattainable, and the problem of living under the open sky is still very painful."
Jack Ross: "I want to be the head coach of Scotland."
Jack Ross, chief coach of the Sanderland FC, claims that "more than anything else" would ever be in charge of Scotland's assembly.
A 42-year-old Scottish man took to restore the club from the north-east of the country, which now holds the third place in the First Football League, at three points away from the leader.
Ross moved to the Stage of Light this summer, returning the last season of St. Mary's FC to Scotland's Premier League.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to Scotland's second assembly, but it's over," Ross told the BBC Scotland radio station during the Sports Sound program.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched Scotland's gathering game at the "Gempden Park" stadium.
The only hope for me is to be successful at the post of the club's chief coach."
Ross' predecessors at the Sanderland FC, including Dick Advocates, David Mois, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kein, Gustavo Poet and Paolo De Canio.
Former FK Master Alloa Atletik claims that he did not feel the excitement of going to a big club after such authority names, having previously rejected proposals from FK Barnes and Ipswich Town.
"At the current stage, I'm going to think that I've succeeded if the club goes back to the Premier League.
Because of its structure and material security, this club no doubt corresponds to the level of the Premier League," he said.
"It will be a difficult task, but another result I will hardly think of as successful."
Ross is only three years old, and he's been working as a second coach at the Dambarton FC, and he's spent 15 months at the Garts FC training station.
Then he helped Alloa to report after FK got into the third division, and next season, St. Mary ran from the flight stage to gaining the title of the first division winner.
According to Ross, he now feels more comfortable than ever during his gaming career at Clyde, Gartulpool, Folkerk, St. Maryren and Hamilton Academic.
"I was in the middle of nowhere," he says, referring to the transition to the Alloa FC.
"I sincerely believed that coaching was more suitable to me than to play.
That sounds strange because I was successful, well earned and achieved certain heights.
But it's not easy to play.
There are many challenges that have to be met each week.
I still face them with stress and stress, but as a coach, I feel at home.
I've always been interested in coaching, and I've never felt so comfortable with my adult life since I chose this profession."

Research: 17:30 on Sunday is the perfect time for a beer cook
Summer heat has helped to increase the amount of pressure on the network of restaurants in British pubs that are not at the best time.
According to the figures for sale in pubs and bars in July, there was an increase of 2.7%, while restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8%.
The author of the book Peter Martin of the CGA, who is in charge of consulting business development, said, "Thanks to the sun's weather and longer than expected, England's participation in the World Championship, July passed through the same scheme as the previous month, when the payer grew by 2.8%, and the restaurant went even worse.
The fall in red by 1.8% in July was increased.
The pubs and bars are oriented towards drinking while they have the best indicators — increasing their profits is equivalent to the loss of restaurants.
The pubs in which they feed also suffered from fever, but not as severe as restaurants.
It seems that the visitors are interested only in drinking.
In sub-control pubs and bars, drinks increased by 6.6% per month, while food sales decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst at the Department of Free and Cheap Business in RSM, said, "We've been observing trends since the end of April.
Weather and large social or sports events remain the main factors that affect domestic sales.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to lose profits. The annual drop in sales by 4.8% causes special concerns about the need to cut costs.
The long hot summer wasn't the best time for food-supply bets, so we'll see if we can get a more moderate temperature that we've seen in August to give them the necessary rest."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the market for new brands.
The Galluse indicator of Coffer Peach Tracker's sales volume in the pubs, bars and restaurants of Britain is a representation of the collected and analyzed productivity indicators of 47 working groups, a total of over 9 billion pounds of sterling.
Every fifth child has a social account hidden from their parents
As research has shown, every fifth child, sometimes under 11 years of age, has a social network account hidden from parents and teachers.
Studies involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictitious pages in Instagram
This news raised concerns about the possible placement of sexual content
20% of students reported having a basic account showing their parents.
Every fifth child, sometimes under 11 years of age, creates an accountant in social networks that hides from adults.
A study involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictitious pages in Instagram — a social network for the exchange of photos.
This news raised concerns about the possible placement of sexual content.
20% of students reported having a clean "basic" account showing their parents, as well as one or more privates.
The mother, who accidentally hit the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, saw the call "violate me."
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) in private schools showed that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles on social networks, and half of these children have recognized that an additional account is a secret.
The head of the HMC Mike Bukenen Association said, "We're very concerned that many teenagers have a desire to create an online space in which parents and teachers can't find them."
Ailid Doyle will be a "representative of the interests of athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Ailid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as an independent director during the annual general board of members of the government.
Doyle, Scotland’s most famous lighthouse, has been called this step by the head of the Ein Beatty, a great opportunity for those who are taking the lead in sports to take advantage of its wide international experience over the past decade.
"Eilide is used with great respect among athletes in Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that by joining her in the council, athletic sports in Scotland will be of great benefit," said Beatty.
Doyle said, "I'm going to be inspired by the role of an athlete's representative, and I hope I can really benefit and contribute to the development of sports in Scotland."
An American, a four - time Olympic champion, who won a 200 - and - 400 - foot - wide [400 m] race in 1996 in the Atlantic, and now a sports observer for the BBC, lost the chance to walk through a transitory Ischemist attack.
He wrote in Twitter, "I had an stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that it would only take time to see if I could recover.
I have learned to walk again and to do dynamic exercises today!
Thank you for your words of support!"
Women's milk-smoothing advertisements compared to cows - Internet user opinions split
The producer of milk-smoothers met with a mixed reaction of Internet users to advertising in which young mothers are compared to active cows.
To mark the release of a product called "the first silent natural milker in the world", the technology company of consumer products Elvie released a commercial in the style of humorous music video to demonstrate the freedom that a new vacuum cleaner provides to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a blue farmer's song that says, "Yes, I feed myself, but I don't have tails" and, "If you see yourself, it's not a poison, it's my chest."
And it goes on to say, "Smooth, smooch to feed the children, smooch, smooch, smooch, so milk doesn't waste."
However, the advertising role, published on Facebook’s page, led to a noisy online discussion.
The video received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, but the reaction of Internet users was different, and a lot of people noticed that the advertising was underestimated by the "horrible organization" production of milk in industry.
"It's not very wise to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and have babies to give milk, but their children are being taken to them for a few days after birth," said one user.
Elvie can easily be hidden in the food bottle (Elvie/Mother)
And there's another comment: "It's understood that it's traumatic for both mother and child.
But why don't you put them in for the milk-sucking ads for women who need to feed their babies?"
And someone said, "This advertisement is very far from reality."
Other users took the lead in protecting the advertising role. One of the women saw the video as "very funny."
"I think it's a great idea.
I would certainly have bought such a thing if I were still breast - feeding.
When I sucked the milk, I really felt like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I didn’t look for anything hidden in it.
A wonderful product," someone wrote.
And there's another comment: "Sometimes ad, oriented towards a baby that sucks milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feels like cows.
This advertisement is not aimed at highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show the milkers hidden in their bottles.
The concept of advertising is based on information that many women who use similar products feel like cows.
But Elvie's shooter works absolutely quiet, has no wires or tubes and is easily hidden in the budgetalt for food, and this allows women to move freely, keep children and even go out the street.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of the advertising agency Mother, commented on the situation: "The Elvie confectioner is so revolutionary that he demanded a bright and provocative presentation.
Having spent a lot of time at the same time with women who suck milk and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the characteristics of breast - feeding, in an exciting and interesting way by demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that a new blower will bring.
Elvie's shooter doesn't get the headlines for the first time.
As part of the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the screen with this product when she showed the clothes from the Martti Jacobovski model.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to the tent town on the Thames border.
The number of detainees has increased sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because strict rhetoric and policies on the part of the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children in nursing homes.
Traditionally, in most cases, caretakers have made their own statements without documents, and now they are afraid to put themselves in danger of staying in the country by offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be obliged to give fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, senior officer of the Bureau on immigration and customs control, testified before the Congress that the Bureau's staff arrested dozens of people who applied for care for minors without escort.
Later, the Bureau confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Approximately 80% of those who are caregivers or members of their households are illegal in the country, many of them foreigners who have committed crimes.
That's why we keep chasing these people," said Mr. Albens.
According to the workers of the shelter, for the sake of speeding up the case of children, officials introduced new rules that would require some of the children to appear before the court during the month after the detention, not after 60 days, as before.
Many of them will be able to use videoconferencing rather than go to court personally to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who do not have the right to receive asylum will be deported quickly.
According to employees of shelter and official data from officials in recent months, as long as children remain under the care of, the more likely they will be to feel anxiety or depression, which may result in outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Drivers claim that these problems are reinforced in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor children’s psychological status.
They added that by moving children to a tent town and not giving enough time to prepare themselves emotionally or to make friends, we risk increasing the trauma that many of them have already experienced.
Syria ordered the U.S., France, and Turkey to take out the army immediately.
Also, speaking before the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister, Valid al-Mualam, called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country has been in war for eight years.
Moala, who also works as Prime Minister's deputy, said foreign forces were staying in Syria's land illegally under the control of terrorism, so "their attitude would be appropriate."
"They have to go immediately and not set conditions," he said to the assembly.
Mualam insisted that "war on terrorism is actually over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has placed some 2,000 military personnel in Syria, mainly teaching and consulting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs, who speak against President Bashar al-Assad.
France sent more than 1,000 soldiers to a desolate war country.
With regard to refugees, Mualem made sure that the country had the right conditions for their return, and he also accused "some Western countries" of "promoting unwarranted fears", which do not force refugees to return.
"We have been called upon by international co-operatives and humanitarian organizations to encourage people to return," he said.
"We're watching an attempt to politicalize the humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped to rebuild the country until the political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war has been reached.
The UN diplomats report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone around Iliba, the last large number of rebels, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
Thanks to the Russian-Turkey Agreement, the massive Syrian forces supported by Russia have managed to prevent the three million people living in the province.
However, Mulam stressed that the agreement had "clear terms", and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the jihadians, including the Al-Qaeda-related fighters of the An-Nurser Front, who would "be destroyed."
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistur expects to convene as soon as possible the first meetings of a new committee to be held by government and opposition representatives to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and create conditions for elections.
The Moule laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that his work should be limited to the "review of the articles of the actual constitution", and warned against interference.
Why the Trump will be re-elected
According to this logic, the Trump can be converted in 2020 if, as many liberal observers are likely to expect, it does not constitute a mandate long after the scandal and imprimism.
Without a doubt, it would be "the most dramatic completion of the presidency all the time"!
At the moment, viewers do not give a sign of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in the premium was more than doubled (up to 1.05 million) on the CNN channel and actually tripled (up to 1.6 million) on the MSNBC channel.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the premium, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on the MSNBC cable channel was at the top of the 3.5 million viewers in the evening when the main news is being discussed.
"It's a fire that attracts people, because it's beyond our understanding," said Neil Ber, a leading drama producer of "Last Candidate" on the ABC channel of the state secretary who becomes president after the destructive attack on Capitol.
Nell Sköll, an experienced writer-gumourist and author of the book "More funny moments: as well as a few tough truths about entering Hollywood men's club," suggests another theory.
She recalled a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The leader told her that she would vote for the Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he's making me laugh," he said.
Chaos's on it.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, Washington's stories are capable of identifying the future of Row's case against Wade, the possibility of bringing together immigrant families and the state of the world's economy.
Distortion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet you can't say that you're just trying to stay informed by citizens when you're watching a group of experts discussing Bob Woodworth's "well-known" sources for his book Strach, a manor Paul Manafort from a $15,000 Straus skin ('wear for the Apparatus'), as it was written in The Washington Post) and the shocking results of Mr. Tramp's anatomy, published by Stormi Daniels.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be a former.
"The reality of the show is partly related to the fact that you get something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of the "Stars of the Blombard" television program, about the rotations in the actor's warehouse and the daily routines of the "Tramp" show.
If you allow yourself to miss a single episode, you can rest hopelessly.
When this week I was able to meet Mr. Fles in his house on the northern coast of the island of Cauai, there was a warm sunny weather (27 degrees Celsius), but he sat at home looking at MSNBC and writing CNN.
He could not get rid of the TV — not when Brett Cavano was put before the Legal Committee of the Senate, but when the future of the Supreme Court hung on his head.
"I remember how we created all those crazy shows of our time, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fles told me.
"I took it as a joke, but it looks like they were right."

Extraordinary impact of costs in the most difficult intermediate elections at Congress
It's not surprising that the 17th county of Pennsylvania is targeted for additional cash, because two actual congressmen are fighting for one chair through the polling districts.
In the fight for this primitive Pittsburgh region, which has recently been changed, democracy enters, a member of the Chamber of Representatives Connor Lemb, who won a victory in another district in the further elections last spring.
Lemb is opposed to another actual congressman, the Republic of Kit Rottfs, who is now the 12th district of Pennsylvania, whose borders are largely linked to the new 17th.
The cards were recast after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January approved the decision that the old boundaries of the areas were designated for the benefit of the Republican against the Constitution.
Pre-elections in the new 17th district caused fierce opposition between the financial divisions of the major parties, the U.S. Democratic Party Committee of Congress Elections (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NRCC).
Lemba's name became very popular in Pennsylvania after winning a minimum victory in the 18th district during an additional election at Congress in March, which was used for public attention.
President Donald Trump won a 20-point victory in this district.
Political experts have given little advantage to the democracies.
In the United States, El Salvador's punishment for China's support was considered, but it was reconsidered.
The diplomats recalled Washington’s weak opposition to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, who had previously supported Beijing’s position.
In June 2017, Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela.
Officials of the State Department decided to withdraw US diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama through "the recent decision on non-recognition to Taiwan," said the Secretary of State of the Department Geser Noiert at the beginning of this month.
But sanctions were only against El Salvador, who received about US$ 140 million in 2017, particularly in the field of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The fines offered to reduce the financial assistance and the target restrictions on issuing visas would be painful for that country in Central America with its high level of unemployment and murder.
As a result of the internal councils of the North American and Central American states, the conference was held at a high level, dedicated to security and economic prosperity, and a similar move took place last year, and it was assessed as a step forward in efforts to keep migrants in the U.S.
But by mid-September, the high-ranking officials of the administration had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and actually the question of sanctions against El Salvador was stopped.
According to diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pens is now planning to hold a conference scheduled for mid-October, indicating that the administration considers this move to be very important.
The three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, for there was no new harsh news or punishment from Washington.
Mr. Bolton’s representative in the White House refused to comment on the details of the internal discussions that had been reported by three American officials, two of whom were diplomats, on terms of anonymity.
The information they received was confirmed by a foreign analyst near the administration, who also spoke under the terms of anonymity.
Learn History
The following dissatisfaction may be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Muller on possible obstacles to the justice of Trump, the important confirmation of why the information available is now available.
As it is reported, in his investigation, Muller is checking the possible link between the Trump campaign and the attack on our voting system on Russia's side.
If the influence of the Congress goes into other hands, the Trump will have to report to conventioners, as well as to the electorate and finally to the one party.
In this case, there's a lot of "if anything," and I don't want to say that the fall of the Trump is inevitable, just like his colleague in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make a choice that determines the duration of the struggle.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to set up a coup against Hitler if only the West began to oppose him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed and have lost the chance to avoid bloodshed.
History has been defined as such a break, and the constant movement of democracy is accelerated or slowed down.
The Americans are now waiting for a few of these breakthroughs.
What will we do if Trump is fired by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom Mr. Muller's fate is based?
Rosenstein came into the loop as soon as this paper reported that he had offered to secretly record talks with the president and shared his thoughts on the subject of the failure of Trump's position.
Rosenstein called the information in The Times inaccurate.
"How do we react if the investigation against Brett Cavano, which has recently been launched by the FBI, proves to be inadequately careful or honest or if the Cavano's candidacy in the Supreme Court is confirmed, despite convincing charges in sexual harassment and the commission of false witnesses?
And, first of all, are we going to vote in the middle of the year for those members of the Congress who will be able to bring about the responsibility of Trump?
If we fail these tests, there will be bad times for democracy.
But I don't think we're going to do it because of the lesson I took in Prague.

Gram Dorrans from Rangers with optimism is waiting for meetings with the Vienna Rapid.
The Rangers FC accepts Rapids on Thursday. After an impressive nobody in Spain in the game with "Villareal" at the beginning of this month's victory over Austrians, the Scottish club will provide a good chance to leave the G League of Europe.
As a result of the trauma of the knee, half-guarder Grem Dorrans was able to play for his team for the first time in the season only in the match with "Villareal", which ended with account 2:2. However, he believes that the FC "Randers" can use this result as a trampline to achieve greater.
"It was a good result for us because "Villareal" is a strong team," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went out in the game with the hope of getting a point and got one point.
At the end of the match, we might be able to move forward, but no one at all is likely to be judged fair.
In the first time, the opponent was better, but after the break, we corrected the situation for our own good.
There will be another major resistance in Europe on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it's not going to be easy. Our future opponents have shown a good result in their last game, but we can count on the support of the impactors.
Last year, of course, it was difficult, starting with my injuries and ending up in the club itself, but the situation was now normal.
We've got a great place, and all the boys are happy.
I hope we can move on, leave behind the past season and achieve success."
Women lose sleep because of the threat of retirement
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to organize care for themselves, few had talked about it with their family members.
About half of those who participated in the Nationalwide survey said that they talked to their husband or wife about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10% of the respondents talked to the children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't rush into talking about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Department of Life Insurance.
Here's what we need to start with.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: your family can't provide you with the care you need if you don't tell your family in advance.
Consult your consultant and your family to determine where and how to get care, as this choice can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Include a financial adviser: He may advise you on how to cover your expenses.
The sources of long-term care include the traditional insurance policy, the hybrid life insurance policy, or the self-sustainment of your own expense.
Prepare legal documents carefully: This will enable you to avoid legal loopholes in advance.
Prepare for your representative who will monitor your medical care and monitor your wishes if you are unable to do so personally.
In addition, we recommend that we develop trust in money.
Choose a trusted person who will make a financial decision for you and pay your bills if you are unable to do so.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, reports representatives of government authorities, but the number of victims may increase.
As a result of getting out of the system of liaison, officials dealing with humanitarian aid can't get any information from Dongal's regency, a region north of Pala, which is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude of the magnitude 7.5 points.
After the natural disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Pala.
Here are some basic facts about the island of Sulavesi in the city of Palo and the regency of Dongal.
Palo, capital of the province of Central Sulavesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulavesi, with a population of 379,800 according to the 2017 data.
When a tsunami struck, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast line in the northwestern island of Sulavesi.
According to the 2017 census, about 299,200 people live in the administrative region located in the lower part of the province.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sectors of the economy of the province of Central Sulavesi, especially the coastal region of Dongal.
Nickel production also has important significance in the province, but mainly concentrated in Morovala, on the opposite coast of Sulaves.
According to the Indonesian disaster relief agency, over the last 100 years, Pala and Dongal have suffered from tsunamis several times.
As a result of the tsunami in Dongal, more than 200 people died in 1938 and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
In 1996, the tsunami also covered the western part of Dongal, and nine men died.
Indonesia is located in a seismic active Pacific fiery ring and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
The following are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a severe earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceg, located in the north of Sumatra, caused tsunamis that struck 14 countries, resulting in the deaths of 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in the province of Aceg.
2005: At the end of March, a series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.

The oldest son, Sara Pailin, was arrested for charges of domestic violence
Treka Pailin, the eldest son of former Governor Alaska and the candidate for Vice-President Sara Pailin, were arrested for charges of assault.
According to Alaska's 29-year-old Pailin from Vassilla, Alaska, reported Saturday's report on domestic violence and alleged that he had obstructed reports of violence and had resisted during the arrest.
According to a police report, when a woman in the area tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he picked up the phone.
According to KTUU, Pailin is currently in charge of the Matanuska-Sositna insulator with the right to make a flag of $500.
He put before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent", when he was asked if he confessed his guilt, reported online.
Palina is accused of three Class A offences, which provide for a term of up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He's also accused of Class B offences, which is punishable by a day of imprisonment and a fine of $200.
It's not the first time he's been charged with criminal charges against Pailin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Pailin.
His mother, Sarah Pailin, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is now before the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, as well as with obstructing reports of domestic violence and carrying arms in a state of alcohol abuse when this incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he hit her face.
In 2016, Sara Pailin was criticised by veteran groups for justifying her son’s brutal behavior with post - traumatic stress after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, an earthquake caused tsunamis: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5 - point earthquake called for tsunamis and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Networks of connections and power supply are out of power, and the number of victims can increase in the next few days.
The earthquake was near the center of the island of Sulavesi, located on the north-east of the capital of Jakarta, Indonesia.
The video on social media shows a moment when the weather hit.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach of Palo when the tsunamis broke down on the shore.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist in New York City
In New York, federal prosecutors demand the death penalty of Saifolo Saipov, a suspected terrorist in New York, resulting in the death of eight people — a rare punishment that was not applied in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
As they say, in October 30-year-old Saip, a driver hired at the Home Depot pickup took off on a bicycle track along a road in the West Side, Lower Mangetten, and began to destroy the bikers and pedestrians that were on his way.
In line with the report of the intention to try to lose the death sentence in the South of the state of New York to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "inadvertently" killed eight people and "inadvertently" caused serious bodily damage.
According to court records, each of these charges provides for the possibility of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal jury filed a 22-point charge against Saikov, including eight charges for murder for the purpose of demanding that federal prosecutors usually be indicted in cases related to organised crime, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of road transport.
According to the prosecutors who described Saipov's crime as "a horrible, cruel and vicious," this attack is the result of "a careful planning and a preconceived idea."
The victims of Saifla Habibullahevich Saipov injured, injured or killed, became Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Lora Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferroche, Ernan Diego Mendos, and Alejandro Damian Pagnukko, as described in the report of intent.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last time in the South of New York, a criminal case that was punishable by the death penalty.
The Lieutenant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers, and eventually sentenced to eternal imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty for the federal case was executed in New York in 1953. The couple, Julius and Ethel Rosenbergov, were executed after they were sentenced for spying for the benefit of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
On June 19, 1953, the Rosenbergs died.
According to Saipov’s court records, Uzbek’s native mother did not display the prejudices of her conscience the following days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigator that he did not feel bad about the crime.
According to Saipov’s indictment, the authorities informed him that he was inspired by the video idyllic attack that he was viewing on his phone.
The police report that he also asked to hang an IDIL flag in his hospital room.
He did not blame himself for the 22 - point charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "very disappointed" with such a decision by the prosecutor's office.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty instead of admitting the guilt and condemning eternal imprisonment without the possibility of release will only enhance the psychological trauma caused by these events for all the victims," Patton said.
Saipov’s defense party also earlier asked prosecutors not to demand a death penalty.
Member of Parliament of the Conservative Party believes that NAYJJELA PARADJA must be appointed responsible for negotiations on Brexit
Today, during a protest campaign at the Conservative Party, Nigel Faraj promised to "mobilize the National Army."
The former leader of the UK Party of Independence stated that politicians should "see the pressure on themselves" of Eurosceptics, since one of the MPs in Teresa May proposed their candidacy for negotiations with the EU.
A member of the Conservative Party Peter Bowe said on the march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be gone" if Mr. Faraj was Secretary Brexit.
Considering the problems that May faced in trying to reconcile its deep-seated ranks, the MPs from the Conservative Party, who objected to the exit, joined a special protest campaign in the city against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is trying to put into practice the compromise Chequers plan, despite the attacks by Brexit supporters, those against the exit, and the EU.
The allies insist that she will not let herself try to deal with Brussels, despite a negative reaction, and force Eurosceptics and Laborists to choose between what she's offering, and the chaos.
At the Leave Means Leave meeting in Seoul, Mr. Bowe said he wanted to "response the Chequers."
He invited Mr. Faraday to leave the shadows and take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had answered for it, we would have come out," he said.
Parliament MP Wellingboro added, "I'm going to support Brexit, but we're going to have to give up Chequers."
Addressing the EU, he said: "We fought in world wars, not for order.
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bown rejected the assumption that after the 2016 vote, the public opinion changed: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and do not want to leave is absolutely not the answer."
A member of the Conservative Party and Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, said to the reporters, "I'm just saying, "Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not supported by our party and our activists who are actually walking in the streets and fighting for the voters' voices.
Please reject Chequers and start listening."
In reference to Teresa May, she added, "Ministers keep their position when they make promises."
Mr. Faraj stated that politicians should "see the pressure on themselves" if they are going to reject the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us, people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them it won't come out of their hands."
In a message to the full enthusiasm of the crowd, he added, "I want our political elite, who is planning to betray the idea of Brexit, to feel pressure on himself.
We are mobilizing the national army of this country, which will lead us to victory in Brexit and we will never be calm until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the opponents of the march passed by Birmingham, and then they held a two - hour meeting in the city center.
Several activists blew the banners against Brexit when they started the group.
The Laborist Lord Adonis laughed at the conservatives because after opening the conference, security problems arose because of their party program.
"These people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and technologies needed for Canada-plus, well-organized border, free trade with Ireland," he commented.
"It's a complete farce.
There's nothing good in Brexit," he added.
Warren's planning to "carefully think" about going to the president's office.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said after the election in November, she "is seriously thinking about going to the president's office."
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday during the general meetings in Western Massachusetts, a representative of the Democratic Party of Massachusetts told of his future.
Warren, who often criticises President Donald Trump, is fighting in November for a second term against a member of the Republican Party of Jeff Dil, who was the leader of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is considered to be the main candidate for combating Trump in 2020.
On Saturday, her 36th election meeting took place in the form of general congregations since Trump entered the post.
The participant asked her if she was planning to take part in the presidential election.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and set up a government, and for that to happen, there must be a woman."
They arrested a suspect in the murder of a gun gun-boiling basketball player, LSU Tigers, Sims.
The Baton-Ruz police, Louisiana state, reported on Saturday that the suspect was arrested on Friday in the murder of the LSU Tigers basketball gun, Wade Sims.
The Baton-Russia Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Diton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. in the East.
On Friday, they published a video recording of the gun asking to help identify the person on it.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot at a campus at the University of Southern on Friday morning.
"The Wade Sims received a gunshot wound in his head and died as a result," said the reporters on Saturday 247sports chief of the Murphy J. Paul police.
Wade joined his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, Simpson was found to be at the scene of the crime, armed with him, and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody in the East-Bonton County Police Department.
Sims, who was 6 feet tall and 6 inches tall and who went to the Junior League, grew up in Baton-Russia, played 32 games with 10 stars in the past season and played on average 17.4 minutes in the field, picked 5.6 points and 2.9 points.
Gran-Pri Russia: Lewis Hamilton cut off his stand for the world's championship after the team decided to give him victory over Sebastian Fettel.
Since Walter Botts left behind Louis Gemilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes’s command decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Botts had a good start from the pole-post and almost walked around Hemilton, who was trying to keep his position on the first two turns and gave Fettel the chance to attack his companion on the team.
The fettel went to the pit stop first and left Gemilton on the track in the run, which was to be decided.
The pilot of the Mercedes team went another round and went out behind Fettel, but Gemilton broke out in the leadership after a certain wheeled maneuver, resulting in the driver Ferrari reluctantly left the inner space through the risk that would hold him, after the double maneuver had made him go forward on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from the back of the network and stayed in the seventh place until the end of the first round.
Later, he led most of the race because he did not change his tires so that he could quickly come to the finish and put Kim Reykkonen in fourth place.
In summary, he stopped at the pit stop at the 44th wheel, but couldn't increase the speed of the last eight, because of why Rickkonen planted the fourth place.
"It's a difficult day, because Walter was teaching full at all the exits and showing generosity when he gave me the opportunity to go.
The team did an exceptional job to take the first and second places," Hemilton said.
The language of the body did not impress
At a meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Finnstein for her firm position that she had not declared the contents of a letter from Christine Blaise Ford, who accused a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano of sexual violence.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not address directly the testimony given by Ford before the Legal Committee of the Senate, but instead expressed his opinion on events in the Senate, which, he said, demonstrated to human "deceptiveness, abhorrence and lies".
"The only thing that could happen, and all the wonderful things that have happened in the Senate in the last few days, are anger, you see the evil people who are showing hostility, abhorrence and lies," he said.
"You look at the publications and the information published, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Finnstein, have you announced the information?
Remember her answer... have you announced the contents of the documents?
Oh, no.
I didn't announce it."
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't," he added, copying the senator's behavior.
In July, Finnstein received a letter containing a detailed statement of accusations filed against the Kawano ford, and its content was announced in early September, but Finnstein denied that the information had been leaked into her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusation, I didn't disclose the information she received from her," said the Finnish Committee, The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it secret, and I didn't break my promises."
However, her opposition seemed to be displeasing to the president, who commented on the Saturday meeting: "I'll tell you, the language of her body was not quite impressive.
Maybe she didn't do it, but I haven't seen anyone holding worse."
As he continued to defend the candidate to the Supreme Court, whose three women were accused of sexual violence, the president admitted that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to restore power in any necessary way.
You see vanity, abhorrence, all they have to do is insult who needs to be violated in order to gain power and control," the Mediaite quoted the President as saying.
Elite League: "Dandi Schart" – "Belfast Giants", 5:3
The player "Jeants" Patrick Duyer threw two sharks in a match against "Dandy."
"Dandi Schart" was rehabilitated for a five-year-old defeat in the elite league of Belfast Giants, winning a match-response on Saturday at 5:3.
"Jeants" got an early advantage in two sharks due to Patrick Duyer's and Francis Bowley's kidnappers.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney compared the bill in the home match, and then Duyer re-entered the "Jeants."
The player "Dandy" François Bushar compared the bill, and the two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory.
It's the third in the season of the elite league defeat of Adam Kiff, who won a volleyball victory over Dandi at 2:1 a.m. Friday night in Belfast.
This is the fourth team meeting in the season.
The first brother of Douayer was shot at the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFall's transfer, and four minutes later, Boville, who received the brother of David Rezerford, doubled the bill.
After a tense first period of fourteen minutes (13:10) Sullivan returned the owners of the field to the game, and at sixteen minutes (15:16) Connie, having received a cookie from Matt Markhardt, compared the bill.
Duyer got the "Jeants" advantage before the first break, throwing his second shin at the end of the first period.
Masters of the fields were regrouped, and Bushar at twenty-eight minutes (27:37) re-compared the account, throwing the ship when his command was overcrowded.
Because of the efforts of Connie and Charles Corcoran Nielsen at the end of the second period, he took Dandi out for the first time and won his team in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the "Jeants" team, which has already lost four of the last five players, is playing a vision match against "Millton Kines."
The air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on the plane could avoid an earthquake
The airman in Indonesia was declared a hero after he helped fly a plane with hundreds of people at the cost of his own life.
Over 800 people died and many disappeared after a severe earthquake that caused tsunamis on the island of Sulavesi on Friday.
Strong underground parcels continue to shake this area, and many people have been trapped in the city of Pala.
However, unlike his colleagues who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the dyspepsia tower, which was very disbanded, at the airport of Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrei in Pal.
He remained in place to make sure that the 6321 Batik Air airline, which was then on the flight deck, was safely lifted in the air.
Then he burst out of the dyspepsia tower when he thought it was going to be destroyed.
Then he died in the hospital.
A representative of the Indonesian air navigation service provider Johannes Siroit stated that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the Australian agency ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan, which is to be delivered to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Paul.
"We're very sorry to hear about it," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the number of victims can reach thousands, as the agency with the mitigation of the effects of natural disasters claims that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Bhutan is limited.
"The number of victims can increase, as many bodies are still under break, and many of them cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a representative of the agency.
The height of the six - foot [6 m] - high miles [6 m] led to the destruction of the city of Palais, where mass burials will take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger planes provide assistance and food.
Rizza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute a quick help brings the body.
Clean water is not enough.
The mini-markets are stolen all over the place."
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Helfand, told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is hurrying to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we don't know that they will be there.
It's a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joco Ododo, arrived at Pala on Sunday and asked the country's military personnel, "I ask you all to work day and night to perform all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?", says CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia suffered earthquakes on the island of Lombok, resulting in more than 550 deaths.
A plane crash in Micronesia: As stated in Air Niguini, after the plane crashed into the lagoon, one man disappeared unconscious
The airline that made a trip to the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now claims that one person has disappeared unconscious, although it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were successfully evacuated from a ton aircraft.
In Air Niguini it was said that one passenger could not be found on Saturday.
The airline reports that its representatives are trying to find a man and cooperate with local authorities, hospitals, and others.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed when it tried to land at Chuk Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven men were taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and they all stayed in stable condition.
The cause of the disaster and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
In the airline and the U.S. V.S.S., the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the flight deck.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has crossed the flight deck.
American passenger Bill Janes said that the plane flew very low on the ground.
"It's very good," said Janes.
Janes explained that he and others managed to get to an emergency exit on a ton of water.
He told us that the stewards were panicking and shouting, and that he had a slight headache.
In the U.S.A., mariners working close to the modernization of the avalanche also assisted in rescue operations by transporting people to the shore by means of an inflated boat before the plane sank at a depth of 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people in the last two decades have been killed in aircraft accidents associated with PNG aircraft, but the list does not include Air Niguini.
An analyst restored the time of the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the accused party violated the case against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
A U.S. Ministry of Justice analyst Paul Roulette witnessed as an expert in the field of operational development for several hours.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to replay the movement of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Roulette, reported The Clarion Ledger, reported that he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers that night when she died that he was opposed to his previous claim.
When the data showed that his cell phone was next to Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the last.
On Saturday, Sanford gave a witness and claimed that he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth, when he said he was in the Sanford pickup that night, Sanford said he was "false because my pickup was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The phone records indicated that they only knew each other for weeks.
Roulette explained that after some time after the death of Chambers Tellis, he issued text messages, phone calls, and contact information from Chambers.
"He stared her from his life," said Gail.
The defense has to set out its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: what is a conscious hip-hop?
Three hip-hop executives want to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed Group in Bristol claims that hip-hop has changed its nature – has gone away with political ideas and struggles to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the sources and make a conscious hip-hop popular again.
Such artists as The Fugees and Commons have recently witnessed the rebirth of this direction in the United Kingdom by such groups as Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark girl?
In New York, she called a couple for release after receiving a "racist" message.
In New York, she called a couple for a discriminatory release after receiving a wrong message from her mother with a complaint that she was "one more dark."
The marriage denies that they are racist, comparing calls with "requisition."
Lance Plasco-Flixman, a mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw that the new bride, Giselle Morris, who came to her first working day in 2016, was a blacksmith.
"We'll have one darkness," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flackman to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending him to her husband, however, she sent him to her mother - in - law twice.
According to New York Post, when she realized her mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Flackman felt "uneasy" and released Ms. Morris, saying that their previous African-American bride was doing a bad job and that she was expecting a Filipino bride instead.
Ms. Morris paid for one day's work, and then they sent her home to Uber.
Now, Morris puts a couple in court, hoping to get compensation for the salary she would get in six months of work with the marriage where she was first hired, even without a contract, and had to pay $350 a day.
"I want to show them what they don't have to do," she said on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
In response to the accusation that they were racist, the couple stated that the release of Morris was a wise decision, for they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after being offended.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco, her husband, Post.
"But would you leave your children with a man who was rude, even if it wasn't deliberate?
Your baby?
I don't think so."
Comparing the call with the "request", Plasko said his wife gave birth to a child only two months ago and "not yet covered."
"Would you blame someone for that?
It's a bad act," added the investment banker.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned this couple on social networks, criticizing their behavior and logic.
As noted in the new letter, the editors of Padington feared that readers might not understand the idea of a bear who is capable of speaking.
Bond's daughter Karen Yankel, who was born almost immediately after the book agreed to be printed, said about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of the one who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
Now it's funny, because we know about the great success that's got the story of Padington."
Speaking of her father, who was a BBC operator, before a little toy bear inspired him to write a children's book, optimizing what his work was being abandoned, she shared how at the 60th anniversary of the book's release she felt at the same time "happy and sad," because her father died a year ago.
With regard to Padington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was quietly proud of having become such a popular book.
"He was quite modest and did not like to boast," she said.
"But Padington was as real to him as his own child! For when the children reach something, we are proud of them, even though it is not theirs, not our victories.
I think he was looking at the success of Padington just like that.
Although Padington was the creation of his imagination, he always attributed success to him."
My daughter died, and I had to apologize on the phone.
After her daughter was buried, she was transferred to a hospital called Louis Pastera in Nice, where doctors were unsuccessfully trying to save her life.
"Nad called regularly, said it was really bad that she shouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Eden-Laperz.
"And then Nad called me and said that she would die for the next two minutes and I should say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Dash, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The doctors who gave her to keep her heart beating gradually stopped acting and quit.
She died for a while before everything was off.
I had to just sit down and wait, knowing what was happening at that time.
I couldn't sue, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really should've held my hand."
Finally, Mrs. Eden-Laperus, who was burning through the loss of her daughter, sat on the plane with other passengers, not paying attention to the severe trials she had to endure.
"No one knew," she said.
"I dropped my head and couldn't hold my tears.
It was hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to feel deep compassion for Nada.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two women who have suffered grief leave their letters to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from putting their hands on them.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys leave a note on the Wally Bridge with phone numbers that people can turn to for support and messages to inspire them.
Miss Davis Tyler’s son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he put his hands on himself.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same way I do every day," she said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lidney, told me that her son was a promising chef with a nice smile.
"Everyone knew him for a smile.
They always said that this smile made any room brighter."
But he quit his job before he died because he was "like in the dark."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11, found his brother’s body after he laid his hands on him.
Miss Davis says, "I'm always afraid that this will have consequences."
Miss Davis made letters, "that people would know that there are those they can turn to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't shut up, you need to talk."
Miss Hamfres, who had been friends with Miss Davis for many years, lost her husband, Mark, who lived with him for 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
"He didn't say that he felt depressed, that he had depression or something," she said.
"In a few days before Christmas, we noticed that he's changed."
And on Christmas day, he finally gave his spirit, and when the kids opened their gifts, he didn't look at them in the eyes of either."
She said that his death had become a huge trauma to them, but they had to survive it: "It's a destructive
It's for the family.
But we must continue to live and fight."

Brett Cavano's future depends on the hair: the FBI is starting to investigate
"I thought that if we could get what we asked -- limited in time and nature of the investigation -- we might have reached a certain agreement," said Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would "resolve" in the face of the inevitable loss of loyalty of the political party.
Why didn't Mr. Kawano and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their lack of desire is a matter of time.
The interim elections will take place in five weeks, November 6th, and if the Republicans are expected to have problems, it will seriously complicate their efforts to bring their own people to the Supreme Court.
George V. Bush phoned the senators with a request to support Mr. Kavano, who worked in the White House for the reign of Mr. Bush, and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
In the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are now sitting, a vote will take place.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavano can have at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pens to solve the problem with the same number of votes and approve his candidacy as the Supreme Court's position.
During Kim's reign, the number of North Korean survivors has been cut short.
After Kim Chen In came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean refugees had decreased to South Korea, a South Korean legislator stated.
Pac Pion Seug, referring to the Ministry of the Republic of South Korea, stated that last year the number of survivors was 1127 compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Pack said that the key factors were to strengthen border control between North Korea and China, as well as that illegal smugglers are now demanding more money.
In Phnijana, public comments were kept out of the way.
The vast majority of North Korean migrants finally offer South Korea citizenship.
In Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans reported illegally crossing the border after the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it's easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers migrants to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still formally at war, has improved markedly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of two countries met in Phhenjana and discussed the issues of denuclearization, which had become a dead end.
This happened after a June historic meeting of the U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Chen In in Singapore, where they generally agreed to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea Foreign Minister Ion-Ho accused the United States of not making progress ever since.
"Without confidence in the U.S., we cannot be sure of the security of our country, so under these circumstances there can be no speech of unilateral disarmament," Ri Jon-Ho said in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavano "historic" and says he's not fit for work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the Chamber of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the candidate for the position of Judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano "historic" and stated that he was not fit for work in the Supreme Court.
Palosi expressed her thoughts on a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I've always thought that if a woman ever acted that way, she'd be called "historic," "Pelosy commented on her reaction to the testimony of Kawano before the Senate's Legal Committee on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally denied charges of sexual violence against Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Cavano acted very emotionally, at times almost screaming and coughing, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling charges against him "absolute and coordinated destruction of the reputation", organized by the Liberals, who were outraged by what Hillary Clinton had lost in the 2016 presidential election.
According to Pélosi, the testimony of Cavano proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed his prejudice toward the Democrats.
"I think that by these statements, as well as his statement against Clinton and the Democrats, he will take his own candidacy," she said.
Palosi was upset when she was asked if she would try to declare the Kavano empire, if his wine was confirmed, and whether they would receive the democracies most of the representatives in the House.
"I'll say so: if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he doesn't only deserve to work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," said Palosi.
Cavano now works as a judge of the U.S. appeals court in the province of Colombia.
Palosi added that as a democracy, she was concerned by the possible decisions of Kawano against the law "On Available Medical Services" or the case "Rou v. Veida", since she was considered a conservative judge.
At his hearings on the question of the approval of the Cavan, the party asked whether he would cancel some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
"Now is not the time when the judge will become an hysterical, prejudiced person and we'll say how wonderful it is," said Pelosi.
Women should have that weapon.
These were just words that contained months and years of anger, and she could not express them without tears.
"We cry when we're angry," she told me 45 years later, Miss Stan.
"I don't think it's unusual, but you?"
She went on, "A woman who worked with an executive director and helped me a lot, said that she also cried when she was angry, but she had her own method, and when she was angry and started crying, she said to her partner, "You can think I'm sorry and that's why I'm crying.
And I'm evil."
And then she just kept going.
I thought it was incredible."
The tears are considered to be an acceptable way out of anger partly because they are perceived differently.
One of my most vivid memories of my first work at the office, where most men worked, became a situation when I once wept out of unspoken anger, and the older woman, the unfriendly manager I was always a bit afraid of, caught me in a cell and pulled me to the front cell.
"Never let them see how you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be glad they got to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Garth was engaged on a non-marriage boat on board called Monkey Business, after he left the race, Miss Schreder was deeply disappointed and decided that there was no reason she could not fight for the president's office.
"It was not a very thoughtful decision," she said to me with a smile 30 years later.
"There have already been seven other candidates in the race, and another candidate is the last one they needed."
Someone called the situation "Biloshika and Seven Gnoms".
Since it was at the end of the campaign, she stayed in the congregation, and she made a promise that she would not participate in the race unless she paid $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who had not harmed men for $1,000, had given her just $250.
"They think they'll give me a discount?" she was surprised.
When she gave a speech and announced that she would not be conducting an official campaign, she was touched by the emotions of the people who supported her, the disappointment of the system that made the collection very difficult and forced her not to focus on voters as well as members of the House of Deputies and the anger of sexism, and she was ready to cry.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Ms. Shredder's press reaction.
You'd think Kleinex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking about what they would write on my tombstone?
"She cried?"
How a trade war between the United States and China can bring blessings to Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the trade war between the United States and China were desperate, and even far from its completion, the long - term gap between countries can benefit Beijing.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, made the first warning shots early this year, taxing the basic Chinese export goods, such as solar batteries, steel, and aluminium.
The biggest situation this week has been compounded by new tariffs at a total cost of $200 billion (150 billion), which actually pays half of all goods coming to the United States and China.
Beijing paid the same coin every time, recently imposing a customs charge of between five and ten percent on American goods at $60 billion.
China has committed itself to using similar U.S. measures, and the second largest economy in the world will hardly be able to keep this promise as soon as possible.
To force Washington to resign means to agree with the requirements, but for China’s President, China’s public worship of the United States is too shameful.
However, according to experts, if Beijing is properly used in the situation, the pressure in the US trade war can bring China a long-term advantage by reducing the link between the two economies.
"A rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a severe economic downturn in any of the countries, and this is actually a greater threat than observers have previously acknowledged," said analyst Abigail Grace, who deals with Asia-related issues at the Analytical Center for New American Security.
Foreign Minister said Syria was "ready" to return refugees
In Syria, it is claimed that refugees are willing to return voluntarily and are being called upon to help rebuild a country that has been devastated by war for over seven years.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mual said conditions in the country would improve.
"Today, the real situation has become more stable and safer because of the progress achieved in combating terrorism," he said.
The government is continuing to rebuild damaged areas so that people can return to normal life.
Now all conditions have been created for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they had to leave because of terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and limited their livelihood.
According to the United Nations, over 5.5 million Syrians fled the country from the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem stated that the Syrian government would be pleased to receive assistance in restoring a war-damaged country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that support the siege.
Europe Strengthens the Battle of Rider in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 when it defeated the U.S. team with an account of 16.5:10.5 on Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has been defeated in Europe for the sixth time and has not won the Cup Rider tournament since 1993.
Europe returned to the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team picked up 14.5 points that they needed to win over the United States.
The American Phil Michelson star, who was trying most of the tournament, had his first long shot at the 16th of July in a couple-3 in the water and acted on the French Molinare.
The Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever went through the 5-0-0 from the beginning of a tournament in modern format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit was defeated at 5:4 by a player with the lowest score in the European team Turbière Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who is taking the first step in the world ranking, took account of 2:1 Jan Paulter from England, who may have participated in the Cup Rider tournament the last time.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran of the Cube Ryder, who has already participated in the tournament eight times, has become a European who has won the most in the tournaments all the time, bringing 25.5 points in his career.
"I usually don't cry, but I can't do anything today.
It was a difficult year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad, I'm so glad to return the cube.
It's the team's merit, and I'm glad I was able to help," he said, without withholding emotion, Garcia after the victory in Europe.
He's handing over to his associate John Rem, who won the American Golf of Tiger Woods on Sunday in a single game with an account of 2:1.
"I feel the incredible pride of winning over Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
In France, Woods lost all four matches and now has a career record on the Cube Ryder 13-21-3 tournament.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time who won 14 major tournaments, only Jack Niklaus.
During the weekend, the U.S. Assembly tried to reach the Fervey area, with the exception of Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas, and Tony Fina, who showed a high - class golf course during the entire tournament.
The U.S. Captain Jim Furick said about his team after the unfortunate speech, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we dominated Europe for a short time.
We fought.
I'm taking my hat off before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the Association of Professional Players in the U.S. Golf and the Club Rider tournament committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You can't praise them.
They've lost us."
Current information about the red tide: decreased concentration in the Pinellas, Manat and Sarasota districts
The last report by the Florida Committee on Fish and Wild Nature shows the overall decline in the color of microorganisms in some parts of the Tampa Bay.
According to the Florida Committee on Fish and Wild Nature, the condition of abundant flowering reported in certain areas of the Pinellas, Manat, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collaire districts is evidenced by a decline in concentration.
The flowering of red microorganisms extends to about 130 miles [130 km] of the shoreline from the north of Penellas to the southern districts of Lee.
Flames can be found about 10 miles from the coast of Gillsboro, but less than last week.
The red tide was also observed in the county of Pasco.
Last week, average concentration was reported in the Pinellas district and its coastal zone, low to high in the Gilsboro district, high concentration in the Manat district, high concentration in the Sarasota district and its coastal zone, mean concentration in the Charlotte district, high concentration in the Lee district and its coastal zone, and low concentration in the Collier district.
