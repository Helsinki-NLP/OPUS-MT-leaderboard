So the ratio of this pattern (divided by 12 to get the simplest ratio by the integer) is said to be 3:2.
Many common patterns (e.g. APS format collection) are similar or close to this image ratio.

The traffic flow is a study of the journeys of the individual drivers and vehicles between two locations and each of their effects.
Regrettably, it is difficult to investigate the traffic flow, since it is not possible to predict the driving behaviour of certain drivers.
As well, drivers generally behave within normal limits, so there is a degree of consistency in traffic flows that can be shown in rough wires with mathematical calculations.
A link between the three main characteristics of the traffic has been defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections help to organize, design and expand accreditation.
