At the emergency call, the professor admitted to shooting his girlfriend.
During a call to the emergency line with a trembling voice, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and it's necessary for them to come home.
Lamb predicted that his "sweet dog" was home alive and probably upset, and that contact with the family of a dead woman can be found on her phone.
Inside the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten message on white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," said a letter signed by Lamb by the authorities.
There was no doubt that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles to school campus where the police believe he shot favorite professor Ethan Schmidt at his office door.
Police chief at Delta State University Lynn Buford said the university employees heard the shooting at 10:18 this morning.
Lamb would have made a fate call on the emergency line shortly after.
Finally another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
On the day after the shooting at the school, the students and the faculty were forced to hide behind the closed doors, the authorities entrusted are still trying to record what Lamb's motivation was like.
Details published by investigators on the part of the state and students and employees who knew him together created a picture of a talented, but probably a problem teacher.
The students confirmed that they were excited about his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no record in the criminal record or a violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote, thanking "big people", with which he shared his academic life.
Both were taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History with the next 17th members of the Faculty, and many students went to classes at both at once.
At the same time, there was an inclination in the case of problems.
A student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed excited and upset, "if there was nothing wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, stated that Lamb told him he was suffering from stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb has already asked Delta State University for free for health reasons when he said he has a problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes regarding the recruitment of university employees meant that the doctorate on which Lamb worked hard would not provide him with an automatic functional period to become an assistant professor.
The president of William LaForge's university said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb probably suffered something."
Lamb won't answer these questions anymore.
After he left the campus, the police caught his mark when he crossed the border of Arkansas state back to Mississippi.
Before he could have been arrested, Lamb killed himself with the only gun in the courthouse about a mile from his parents in the suburb of Greenville in Mississippi, confirmed the coroner of the state of Washington,methel Johnson.
The car left on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb was going to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this country.
Lamb started working at a university, which has 3,500 students in the city, which is about 12,000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and training hours.
In the spring, he got a doctorate in education.
One of the long-standing friends of Lamb described him as a smart, charismatic and funny person.
Carla Hairston stated that she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met through common friends.
She was with her friends at high school and he was the great elder boy who taught her guitar playing for several years.
It was quite a heart-mapping at the time.
The hearts of all the girls melted as soon as he showed up," says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson suburb.
Lamb and Prentiss probably spent some time together.
During the emergency call Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the record of the wedding never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house next to the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was okay.
The ex-husband Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were separated 15 years ago, but they remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely devastated," said O'Steen about her daughter.
She was with her mother's best friend.
O'Steen said he didn't meet Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he knew Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss when he and Abigail attended the annual festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter was writing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and the occasional entertainment coordinator in The Julep Room, a very lighted bar near Gautier, said that he last saw Lamba and Prentiss on the night of September 5, the path Lamb played on guitar and harmony for countless crowds.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We were flattering and filming each other for a joke.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, who was killed by a professor, led a seminar in the first year and specialized in the original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of a male student club and the government of students.
In the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including members of the faculty, employees, students and members of the community, participated in commemorative events with candles.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and Brother Jeff Schnitt also took part in the surveillance during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
On Wednesday, the school began again.
"We're trying to get our students back," says LaForge.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of treatment.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Authors for Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this report.
This story was adjusted to reflect the fact that the police now claim that Lamb made a call on the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called his wife Prentiss, there is no evidence that they were truly committed.
Toys R Us plans to hire less seasonal workers
Toys R Us states that they do not take as many seasonal workers as last year, but the producer of children's toys and products claims that it gives current employees and seasonal workers an opportunity to work out more hours.
The company also stated that it plans to hire around 40,000 employees at work in shops and distribution centres throughout the country, which was reduced by 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company announces that it will start with the recruitment this month, and the employee will pick up during October until December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the purchase holiday season is getting closer and companies are preparing to receive temporary aid workers in shops and sales, for the dispatch and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'Rande' with Princess Diana
The "Back to the Future" premiere was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Foxe.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the arrival of the royal family, when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I found that Princess Diana was going to sit there," said in the trailer for the next document, "Back in Time."
The movie is starting and I'm beginning to realize that I'm on to something that could be called a fake date with a princess from Wales.
"Back in Time," is a document on "Return to the Future," which introduces talks with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The "Back to the Future" premiere was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's really the best travel document for me that has ever been filmed."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and selected movies in October.
Chief of the United Nations says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict of nearly five years of conflict and more weapons only exacerbates the violence and suffering of millions.
The chief of the United Nations called again on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to join and support the inclusive political solution dialogue.
Ban said at the mid-term press conference that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent councils of the countries - the USA, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the end of the Ministerial Meeting of the General Assembly at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He said policing that the division in the Council and between Syrian people and regional powers "make this situation unresolved."
The Ban called on the five remaining members to show solidarity and unity, which they demonstrated when reaching the Iranian nuclear agreement in solving the crisis in Syria.
8 election numbers showing Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to label him as a man who often changes his mind.
The others over the maverick's hand as over the unspoken joke.
And some are preparing for implosion.
But if some Republicans are already trying to get Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they won't do it (now).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in charge of a two-digit number, and some people are really starting to wonder what this means for the nomination of this magnet from the real estate area.
Of course, it's just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says Trump is probably winning a Republican nominee.
The experts point out that during this period of 2011 Rick Perry was taking the lead to Herman Cain's resignation, and finally none of them won the only position in the nominating process.
There's a lot of reasons why he could be in general elections.
But external groups such as Super PAC Jeba Bushe and the Club for Growth economic conservative group are aware of Trump's willingness to hold and start spending their dollars on a table with a view to hitting him.
Here are some recent voting numbers that indicate that the real magnet is not just a mixed phase:
The trumpet assessment of the benefit has turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University's vote showed that only two of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real magnet.
In mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of July, it was 52 percent.
Now six of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers are kept in the initial stages.
Following the vote of the University of Quinnipiac, which took place last week, 60 percent of the Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP's wishes would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 per cent of Republicans reported that they would be either "congratulation" or "satisfaction" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 admitted that they would be "defeated" from his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same level of excitement as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "invented" against 40% who say the same thing about Trump).
Another closest to the level of excitement?
Marco Rubio is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of Republican volunteers claim that they would be "unsatisfied" or "unsatisfied" if they preferred Jeb Bush as a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticized for his insensitivity and insults, 52 percent of the Republican volunteers are totally inclined to think that the real magnet has the right temperature for the post of president, according to Monday's vote ABC News/Washington Post.
The same number is kept in Iowa State Senate Club, which is the first in the whole country where 52 per cent of Republicans think it has the personality of the commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent feel that he has no personality to serve effectively, and almost 6 out of 10 independents say that his temper does not belong to the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are used to this idea.
When he puts on his student hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
On the question of who most likely wins the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to the CNN/ORC survey last week.
This is a change from late July when four of the 10 people put their money on the Jeb Bush.
Full publication: The GOP voters did not have the most clear crystal ball in the past.
In the past cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the winner of the 28% candidacy for the possible nomination of Mitt Romney.
However, it is shown that a number of GOP volunteers see the Trump campaign as credible.
Although the Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump will defeat almost everyone anyway.
Some students stress that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is widely distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But the study of Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical direct battle between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is almost always receiving majority support.
He leads over Carly Fiorin by 13 points, Mark Rubem by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jebe Bushem by 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christem by 33 points at each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would run over a dealer with a wide 19 points in a hypothetical fight against one another.
A large majority of the stairs of Donald Trump claim that they have already made their own views.
The new Tuesday CBS/NYT survey shows that only more than half of Trump’s supporters claim that they will no longer change their opinion.
It is obvious that many things can change, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
46 percent say they're leaving the back door open for a change between the candidates.
However, Trump's present strongest opponent is his external neurosurgeon Ben Carson's colleague, but voters who consider their opinion final would go twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 out of 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on immigration issues.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violent" in his campaign announcement, immigration is still being held as the main and central theme of the 2016 conversion.
Some fear that Trump's bluffing distance away from the Republican side of key Spanish voters and damage efforts to rebranding.
But according to a new Monday's ABC/Post public opinion, six out of 10 Republicans claim to agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that while the theme of immigration remains in the shadow of the reflectors, Donald Trump will remain as well.
Frustration from the government reaches new maximums.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive nearly half of the support from the Republican volunteers, and above all because of their foreign status.
Six out of 10 Republicans in a new Monday's ABC/Post vote claim they prefer political outsiders than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
The vote of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa were frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, 54% were "unsatisfied" and 21% were "inflamed."
Szymovna supported a greater share of the state's carbon charges.
Czech Republic's getting over 400 million.
In the first reading, the Ambassador supported a government novelty of the Upper Law, which adjusts the amount of the charges on coal from the mining companies’ surface.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised Members that this would also make money available both to the public and to the budgets of the municipalities.
The proposal was criticised by opposition Members, who are afraid that companies in charge will no longer want to sponsor the local community as well as today, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The first reading supported the government's new top law, which means, in addition to others, that the State should receive a greater share of the revenue from the tax on coal from companies in charge.
The state's share increases to 67 per cent, while the population's share decreases from today's 75 per cent to 33 per cent.
The proposal also changes the method of calculating the compensation for the imbalances that companies incur.
The change in interest rates for the interest rate is due to bring in a government deposit of 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
According to the Government, the budget revenue of the municipalities should have a neutral impact because the fee should be higher.
In the year preceding, the municipalities received around 450 million crowns and the state budget of 150 million crowns.
From the coal industry, there were about 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns.
Novela is also included in the increase of the remuneration from the area of production with a permissible weight of 1000 kroner per hectare per year.
The receipt of these grants shall continue to be to the full extent of the municipalities.
Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told the MPs that this resulted in a total of 14 million to 100 million crowns per year.
The amount of the fee will no longer be fixed by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
Recalculated as a component of the amount of depleted malts and rates for individual types of malts.
According to the government, the change is due, inter alia, to a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, the envoy of the ODS Marek Benda warned that the establishment of a fee by the government regulation should not be in accordance with the constitution.
According to Minister Mádka, however, the tax is not in this case because the state is paying the interest that is a state's property.
Fees shall be granted only to the countries whose territory is affected.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the county and a quarter of the state will receive.
The same will be true in the case of radioactive mountains.
The part of the money that is made at the expense of the fee will be objectively bound.
For example, 28 per cent will have to go to repair damage after recovery or to ensure the banishment service.
The proposal was criticised by the opposition MPs, who claimed in particular that they would harm the villages affected by greed and countries.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Starostov) warned that businesses would no longer want to sponsor the municipalities just as much as they do today because they would pay higher fees directly to the government budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," said David Kádner (Usvit) elected in Austria.
Before the increase in unemployment in Mostecka, the KSČM MP, Hana Aulická, warned.
Kádner and Aulička were unsuccessfully proposing to reject the novel, but Kučera wanted the law to return to the government to work.
The explanatory report states that, according to the companies concerned, the increase in fees does not lead to carbon prices, as prices are more than 90 per cent long-termly agreed.
The main consumers, such as electricity or heating, should therefore not feel an increase in prices.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that trade unions will compensate for the increase in wages to reduce their operating costs, which in particular would mean reducing the number of employees," the government admits.
According to it, however, the increase in wages from the point of view of employment is difficult.
According to the report on the new Milan Urbana (ČSSD), it is key for Members to know the conclusions regarding the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limit values for coal.
If coal reaches beyond the limits, it will have an impact on income for the country and the country, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Youth that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovakian army should fall until 2020.
The limits at the bottom of the ČSA should be broken for social, national and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Happy will lead the Czechs as one, setting up an influential weather.
All four Czech serenes will appear during the fourth rounding of Davis' baraque in India on the table, and this time each of them will probably also get into the game.
Captain Jaroslav Return plans that, in view of the difficult conditions, the burden will spread throughout the quartet.
In Dillí there is hot and high air humidity, which is expected to result in intense fights that can be extended up to five centuries.
We've got to get it in the bag.
I'd like to expand it by weather.
And according to what it would look like, he said back at today's Czech election training in the center of Radje Kumára Khanny.
With one team and the world's four-hundred Jiřím Happy, it counts for Friday and Sunday doubles.
In the position of the twin, it is likely that Lukas Rosol and Radek Štěpánek will run.
I'd like them all to be involved.
I've got it in my head, but I'm not going to say it yet, Captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech composition should be the participation of Štěpánkov in the Saturday quarter.
It's just a question of who's going to stand next to an experienced deli who has a cup in Davis's fourth balance sheet 18:4.
It's probably not going to be happy.
There are still possibilities with Rosal or Adam Pavlásk.
"I really don't know who and what it's gonna look like," said Return.
It shall be determined by two developments.
The version may be Pavlásek, surprised by the 1st round of the win in the fat on Australians.
"He's to the fat one," said Return.
I'm happy with Australia, and if I'm playing, I'd like to do the same thing I've been doing since the second set.
"I'd like to get a point for these experiences," said Paullasek.
The home is placed in Yuki Bhambri's twins (125th in the ATP Scoreboard), which won a challenger last week in Shanghai, where he defeated third and fourth hundred scorers.
Two will be Somdev Devvarman (164.).
They're both challengers and our experience from the ATP Tour, but we've been convinced many times that the dice in the Davis Cup are not going to decide.
"He casts momentary shape, weather," said Return.
The five starting twos start at 6:30 SELC and can pull over due to weather.
According to the forecast, she's having a shower and the jacket isn't under the roof.
However, it can be played for artistic lighting, if any.
They've already lit it and it's got some two thousand luxury, which is enough.
"It should be done under the lights," said Returnil.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Mr. Corbyn's debut in PMQ is very eagerly expected since his election
The new workman Jeremy Corbyn will have his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and first he will have to work with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six questions in the afternoon, while his performance will probably be carefully examined by the media and the MPs.
In a weekly statement, he asked for "less theatres and more facts."
He also stated that he could skip a few sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test by Mr Corby, who comes after his appointment to the shadow office and his Tuesday speech to the annual TUC Congress.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour Leader to remain silent during the national hymn singing in service on Tuesday to the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the British battle met with criticism from a number of conservative MPs and is the focus of several stories on the headlines.
Mr. Corby's decision not to sing national hymns drew attention
Speaking Mr. Corbyn said he would "stand in a respectful silence" and recognize "the hero of the royal flight in the battle of Britain."
However, a member of the shadow cabinet Mr. Corbyn, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two's Newsnight program that he would recommend to the Labour Leader that the national hymna sing "without regard" to his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve at the top of Mr Corbyn's team, quoted differences in economy, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than six parliamentary parties initially supported him as leader.
The BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that the political differences in work are also "organized" after Mr Corby's appointment across his position in the European Union and the government limit.
Mr Corbyl pointed out at the TUC conference that the Working Party had tabled amended proposals to remove the whole idea of a dose limit.
A few hours later Mr. Smith, a shadow worker's secretary and employee, stated that the party "very clearly" opposed government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Working Party, whom David Cameron has been facing for decades since his election as the leader of the Conservatives.
The leader of the working party, who promised a different approach to politics, claims that he had ideas "from the bottom" on questions for Mr Cameron and received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North argues that PMQ is too confrontational and that it will be held back both "ready-to-response" and toothed trade, and instead promises to focus on important problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, a shadow business secret, will represent him at PMQ when he is not involved — such as when Mr. Cameron leaves abroad.
He also left the idea that he would allow other colleagues to come out from time to time because he heard that he was still discussing the whole issue with John Bercow's speaker.
When Mr Cameron became the leader in 2005, he said he wanted to turn himself away from the "Punch and Judy" policy, which was often associated with PMQ, but a few years later he admitted to failure.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer in the decision of the leaders, their management of the library and their attitude among the other MPs, although critics have argued that they have become caricature and that they need far-reaching reforms.
"Joburg photo": Young homeless trained as photographers
The Johannesburg Centre is a difficult place for homeless people.
But one group of former children found a way to learn something and earn a living.
"I was drawn in Johannesburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take pictures of their neighbors and make money like that.
The BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

The costs could affect plans to expand JD Sports, adding, which could mean less new jobs.
The resistance of Prague's flats is marchmeloon.
Controversial building's got a stop.
The investor of Prague Projecti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be illegal and will appeal against it.
Against the building, which is to take place in close proximity to the Anješka monastery in the centre of Prague, there were protests before the Prague office of 1 hundred people, and petitiones.
The judge found in the decision that a violation of the construction law had occurred because not all the relevant parts of the territorial decision had been complied with.
"The subject matter of the territorial decision does not include certain aspects, such as the type of land, the distance from neighbouring buildings, the sufficiently clear and understandable form of the building, the definition of the area affected by the impact of the building," the decision states.
It also considers that some of the grounds for the decision were issued to the original documents discussed but changed.
This is, for example, the opinion of environmental authorities.
Part of the building is intended to occur on the ground of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
It follows from the written material that, however, the owner of the land has only given consent to the project documentation for territorial management, not to the location of the building on his land, the building committee writes.
According to Francesca Augusta Rasetta of the investment firm, the building order committee did not take into account the decision of the senior authority - the Ministry of Local Development, according to which the period for the initiation of the review had already expired.
Anyway, it's a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, we respect all the laws of the Czech Republic and respect all the authorities and institutions concerned," Rasetto stated in the press report.
A project that people are called marshmeloon because of the so-called color of the facades, is a strong emotion in Prague.
In the center of the city, hundreds of people gathered in the past to protest against the construction.
The association and the people of neighboring homes suggest that a permit was issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticise the inconsistencies of the building for the historic centre of Prague and the immediate vicinity of the Anješka monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Franek, the project changed several times.
The original form of the 2008 project, which was calculated with a mirrored facade, rejected the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the National Monumental Institute (NPU)’s opinion and suspended the permit of the Prague monuments in 2010.
The new project of Prague Projecti e Investimenti with face-to-face windows was approved by the NPU and the Magistrates and on this basis a building permit was issued.
The author of the proposal rejects the extracts of the opponents, since he never counted with the facade in pink, which gave the project a nickname after pink-white sugar.
The Czech policy has bound migrants.
The Hungarians put him in the pool with them.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to refugees.
On his way, he took three Syrian refugees with his crew to the car, who were about half a mile away.
At that time, according to him, it was not yet punishable in Hungary, he claimed to be the People's Newsman.
We knew the law enforcement officers didn't do that.
But when the police stopped us, we were arrested for our surprise and transferred to the investigation in Szeged, he wrote a letter.
In the end, he spent nine hours in politics.
The cops were doing the right thing, but the communication was tied up, because they didn't have too good English.
But in his opinion, the prison was sad.
For example, in our target of a size of about three times four meters, 15 refugees from Syria were forced to flee.
There was also a two-year-old boy or four-year-old girl.
These people had been locked up there the other day, and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what would go on with them, Berg said.
What can't have fun anymore?
Ask the Presidents of the Executive Chamber.
On Friday 18.9., from 9:30, he will answer the readers' questions to the President of the Chamber of the Czech Republic, Pavla Fučíková.
You can ask her for changes to the law on executions applicable from 1 September 2015 and other matters related to executions or executions.
Metcash launches a campaign on the countryside to fight Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA business from Aldi's efforts in southern and western Australia.
Metcash launches a campaign on the countryside to fight Aldi invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 shops in southern and western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and build IGA brand by marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers are added with brands such as the Simmo's ice cream maker based on Dunsborough, offering tastings in IGA shops and shop owners are selling cheap tickets to local customers on the Australian football league.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29, when food, alcohol and hardware vendors celebrate their annual investment strategy day.
There is a lot in bet, because South and Western Australia represent almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA business steps and generate a higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in South and West Australia are notorically provincial and IGA stores use a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared to about 14 per cent in Eastern States.
In any case, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will attract 5% of the food market in these two countries within 12 months of the opening of the first shops that took over the markets from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
This week in his report, analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that IGA retail might lose USD 360 million on an annual sale and Metcash $250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in southern Australia and 30 in the west during the next year and generate sales of USD 500 million and 600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in a solid Metcash price base could amount to around 13 million US dollars in pre-tax revenues, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states, mainly towards Aldi and Coles, although Roy Morgan's latest investigation found that the buyers in the IGA were most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that sales of Metcash's food will decrease by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, and its market share decreases from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week the head of the Hamish Douglass Fund, founder of the Magellan Group, said trade lunches in Melbourne could "very likely disappear during the decade.
Metcash refused to react publicly to Douglas' comment.
But it is known that a member of the Metcash representation contacted Douglas last week.
The market share of IGA fell from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and Metcash's food market profits, which were supplied by around 1200 retail IGA, fell by 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of the change in speculation because sales and profits are under pressure.
However, the wholesale has gone into the counterattack and invests more than USD 150 million a year to compare the retail prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week and thus helps small IGA retailers to reequip their stores by adding fast growing food and news from private customers.
Executive Director Metcash, Ian Morrice, argues that the price comparison and acquisition programmes fall and hopes that the great-grandfather will return to basic profit growth in 2017 first in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more glory than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a side-run loss in recent events around his friend Nick Kyrgyz and deserves his praise rather than criticism, says President Dennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a young member of a talented duo often called "Special Ks", drew unwelcome attention to himself due to the affair with the ungrateful Kyrgyz and Stan Wawrinka on Montreal Masters.
Soon thereafter, in the passionate qualifying match at Cincinnati, they had to be Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison separated twice by the judge, Harrison then declared: "The warline had one to pull Kyrgyz and I had to pull him too."
While he was last seen breaking up the rocket after the hog threw Richard Gasquet's possible power at the US Open, Kokkinakis was constantly defending Healy.
The young man is currently located in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth on the second double for Bernard Romic in the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I've been thinking quite intensely about the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little stuck in the whole dispute," Healy says.
He destroyed his rocket when he lost it because of a cricket in the U.S., but it's not the first player who, because of frustration, would kill his own reputation on his rocket. I know Thanassi pretty well and I can say he won't be proud of this event.
But he was really very well controlled because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so I think he deserves great recognition.
He's got a fantastic team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he's working very hard, and he's falling into the team great and so on, he's never had a problem with other players, he's very respected in the closet, he's training hard, he's in a wonderful condition, he's a very stable and successful young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to look over Kyrgyz for an important match starting on Friday, and stated that "the mutual decision" is the right solution for all, but supports a parent from Canberry to return to the team as a long-term chair.
"Before long, we want our team to be completely focused on the fight and not on all the controversy that has arisen around him [Kyrgios]," Healy says.
And I think Nick got up very fast, as Federer, Murray and other people point out, in the eyes of the public, he has made a number of terrible mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time outside the broadcast, when he can think about it, is, in my opinion, the best solution for the team and also for himself.
The European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Following the announcement of the state of the threat, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those who tried to make it illegal in order to stop the influx of migrants.
There was chaos at the border, while hundreds of migrants gathered in the country and the Serbian authorities responded in protest.
Those who spend an unknown period of time in the country's belts between the two states are those who run away from domestic violence, set up and settled.
But there's a feeling of frustration coming.
When the helicopters fly over them, migrants call together "Open Borders!" and supply the regular Hungarian police units.
Some reject food and water for protest.
Serbian Foreign Minister declares it was "unacceptable" to send refugees back from Hungary, while they are still coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just direct interest.
During the next few days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
Concerns at the Hungarian-Serbian border came the day after the 28-nation bloc did not come with a single immigration policy at the ongoing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in surprised Italy and Greece and spoke with hope of reaching a possible agreement next month or at the end of the year, which the EU nations would adopt more than 120,000 other refugees, including Hungary.
Germany's Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria launched the European Union's special summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
However, Hungary did not put its hopes in Brussels or its neighbours.
The internal threat situation in two southern regions has given authorities greater power to address the crisis and has allowed them to close the roads and speed up cases of asylum proceedings.
Meanwhile, Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijarto said his country is also planning to build a fleet from the rest of the way along the border with Romania to stop refugees who are trying to cross their country when the plot is now completed on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even the prisoners were on the list of those who helped to pull the remaining wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the main weakness and point of entry into the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle East countries.
However, the President of the Government of Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants, who lead a better life and not war refugees, who seek protection, which is a view that is clearly different from that of the other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalize violations of the 4-metre area, which the government has allowed to build on the southern border with Serbia, and also provides for longer prison periods for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring the threat," Zoltan Kovacs spokespersons told reporters in the southern town of Szeged.
In this we are very clear: the illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Technically, Parliament still has to approve the deployment of the army that was waiting for next week, but the Reporters Associated Press on the border have observed the heavily armed army with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bacondi, Orbana's counsel for domestic defense, said that the authorities caught 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 already caught on the territory of the state.
They have been prosecuted by damage to the area and are now in police custody accused of committing violations under new laws.
The authorities had the plot fixed quickly.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using the trailer covered by the rest of the wire.
On the main border crossing at Roszke, chaos arose because the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and created people's pressures.
About 20 of them went in, but thousands stayed out.
Another group of refugees blocked the main road connecting Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's jump in front of Bernie Sanders fell by half in the national vote
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton is still holding a two-digit stand at the Democratic race on national nominations, but Senator Bernie Sanders is taking her stand.
Clinton now supports 47 per cent of the democratic primary desires (down by 58 per cent), while Sanders is in second place by 27 per cent (up by 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he wants to become president, is receiving support from 15 per cent of the democratic primary will.
More than five months before the start of the main competitions, the most democratic voters claim that it is too soon to say that they are clear decisions which candidates will support.
But Clinton's sponsors are more confident of their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News poll, Clinton lost ground under his feet in several demographic groups, while Sanders gained several.
Clinton keeps a big drive between women and calms down, but her conduct is getting worse.
Her support between men has been significantly reduced and Sanders loses only 5 points on it.
The benefits of Clinton with democratic voters under 50 years of age have faded and are now equal to Sanders.
But Clinton still has great leadership thanks to older volunteers.
Last month Clinton had a double jump in front of Sanders between the liberals, but now Sanders is losing only 5 points in this group.
About half of the democratic primary will in all states says she would be very supportive of Clinton if she became a candidate for the party.
A quarter would support her with certain awards and another 15% would only support her as a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
It's probably not surprising that Clinton's current followers are particularly enticing.
The views are mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only a quarter would support it.
While 48 per cent of democratic primary voters say that they would be very supportive of Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 per cent).
When Clinton's beneficiaries are asked in an open question why they want it as a candidate, the most common answer is that he has the right experience (16 per cent), he follows that it is time to be the president of a woman (13 per cent) and that he is the best candidate for this job (10 per cent).
Clinton's guests also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
The following is quoted as a great possibility of election and harmony on problems.
While the Vice-President is considering a potential candidacy for the President, 57 per cent of the democratic primary will would like to see him go ahead - a third would think he should not run again.
When the primary democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second choice for the nomination of the party, the most frequent choice is Biden.
Between Clinton's supporters, she introduced more than half Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides to ignore the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's leadership will extend from 20 points when Biden is running, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of democratic wills see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning in general elections; however, this figure fell from 78 percent last month.
Poor is far from the other, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely elective is growing.
However, when it comes to the question of the greater importance of the candidate, democratic voters prefer to solve problems before a greater chance of election.
Like last month, neither a democratic candidate nor a potential candidate is an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key features among the primary voters of their parties.
Most people see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Poor of all three leads in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of the democratic primary wills don't think Clinton is honest and reliable, so twice as much as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have that view on him.
Primary democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological perspective.
As for all these measures, about a quarter of democratic wills have no opinion on Sanders.
As regards Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal e-mail and server as public secrets continue, most of the primary democratic wills are satisfied with her explanation of this matter and say that their overall view did not affect it at all.
But among the American public, it's a completely different story.
Half of the Americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this issue was divided in March, shortly after this problem arose.
Most Americans claim that this e-mail controversy has no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent of their opinion on Clinton has deteriorated.
It's mostly about Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claim that their views on Clinton have deteriorated.
Although Clinton is perceived as honest and reliable among her party voters, this question is still a problem among registered voters in general: only 32 percent see her as honest and reliable, which is a decrease of eight points from last month, and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered volunteers don't think she's honest and reliable.
And at the same time 55 percent of registered volunteers across the country also don't see Trump as honest and reliable.
However, Clinton and Trump have good marks for leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush were the best.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, like Carson, a lot of people didn't think about him.
The range of errors in sample 351 primary democratic wills is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ended up behind Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in CBS News/New York Times
Two candidates are responsible for half of the volunteers in the latest survey and the others are failing to look for support.
Voters from a number of Republicans throughout the country continue to support Trump's hardwood majority, with 23% of the last CBS survey carried out before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The research also found that Carson is running well across demographic groups, and is cutting off Trump among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and the governor of the state of Ohio John Kasiche, is behind the Wisconsin governor Scott Walker in full desire of 10% of the support fell to the current 2%.
Former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place together with 6%.
The error rate for sample 376 Republican volunteers in the latest survey is plus minus 6% and occurred in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week showed that Carson had improved and achieved 19% support among the Republicans for Trump's 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
At Carson's rising trend, Trump decided to take the shot blind to the neurosurgery in service, and even Carson apologized for his inquiry into Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump declared last Saturday during the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood accused of the death of a student of the first year of Baruch College
Nearly two years after the student died during a brotherly ritual at Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, a charge of murder was filed against five people.
The members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chuna "Michaela" Denga at the beginning of the ceremony in September 2013 and took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police announced.
The police say he had closed eyes, he had a full sand on his pockets with a total weight of 30 pounds, and he was repeatedly harassed when he tried to reach the target over the frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about his headache and then fell unconscious.
The members of Pi Delta Psi's brotherhood didn't call 911 right after Deng passed away, and allegedly waited an hour before they took him to the hospital, the police said.
However, they found time to dress up Dengo's dress, expose his symptoms and contact Andy Menga, the president of the state brotherhood, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris Vagner introduced the press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide their equipment and essentially gave preference to the blessing of the brotherhood before Michael Deng's life," chief Wagner said.
He couldn't get back to life and died the next day.
According to the drinking news, Deng was repeatedly hit by a stupid object in his head, body and stamina.
"To a large number of families have been devastated as a result of the bridges, and at least one student dies every year because of the bridges since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Dengo family, in a statement.
Brotherhood and its members must be responsible, and this step is important by the authorities.
The great jury of Monroe County recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Menga, will also be charged with assaults on prosecutions and crime.
"We want to keep not only those involved, but in case there is an organization that has approved it, whether officially or informally, we will also take responsibility for it," Wagner said at the Tuesday press conference.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood disrupted its relationship with local branch offices.
This happens when Fed increases interest rates
The increase in interest rates will come and the bull's market will fluctuate, debt yields will rise and the economy will shrink.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it takes and how long it's gonna take.
For the economy, the story of a small originator offers time.
The recession came 11 months after the first increase in rates and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve System in increasing interest rates is often, although not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
This is why US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when the interest rate increases, but rather on the trajectory of how long the normalisation will take.
There's really more variables in the game.
Finally, however, members of the market can ensure that all speed increases can be exceeded.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the era of 'financial money'," said Julian Jessop, the global economy leader of Capital Economics.
On the contrary, we do not expect a gradual return of American interest rates to a more common but still low, creating a seismic shock that many might be afraid of.
That means it's going to have adverse effects.
Here is a view of how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
In view of what the market has recorded in the last cca month, the expected increase in rates can make the air slightly unstable.
But once the increase occurs, the effect won't be so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend for the re-stopping of the stock after 12-24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the gap in monetary policy again," said analysts Deutsche Bank in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed increase.
More precisely, the market in the last 35 years is often - about 14 percent - aimed at increasing interest rates in a relatively high 250 days (average increase of 2.6 percent) and then returns to normal status after 500 days, with an average result of the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to Bob Doll's recent analysis, the main action strategy of Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on the stock has a tendency to become more significant later in the interest rate increase cycle and the return is beginning to decrease.
Recese is a real economic life, but increasing rates often help her.
At the present time, Fed faces certain conditions that have not yet existed and that could speed up the recession.
The most remarkable is that a rough domestic product near its lowest point in history as the rate of Fed increases.
According to Deutsche Bank, at 118 increases in rates since 1950 were only twice the nominal annual growth of GDP below 4.5 per cent.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 percent, few expected to keep it, when in the third quarter it was only 1.5 percent, says Atlanta Fed.
Increased rates in this complex economic background could be risky and the question could arise, "Is this time different," said Deutsche.
The market participants were preparing for the growth of the Fed all year round, and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Committee for the Free Market, which took place this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategies and economists believe that FOMC could approve growth at this meeting, future trading only indicates a 25% probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the growing cycles have been in the super cycle of increasing the pack effect with HDP covering the beginning of the recession very quickly after the beginning of recovery," the report says.
On the contrary, this was a clearly slow recovery from the worst recession during the sampling period.
The current cycle is far longer than the Fed expected since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are 74 months and we continue.
The outcome was also volatile because the market expects interest increases and the pattern is somewhat similar to what the stock is experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is more visible in bonds than in actions when the Fed changes policy direction.
In the case of bonds, the income appears to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase/decrease cycle.
At the end of the cycle, the rise in debt securities will fall immediately," Deutsche said.
The strategic Charles Schwab believes that the increase in rates leads to an approximation of the incomes between long- and short-term bonds, which is equal to the curve.
High-performance bonds often work better in this climate, even though "we are still careful to push the output," stated in her analysis Kathy Jones, a firm fixed-income analyst in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets are already adapted to the expectations of the Fed policy.
"In addition to the strengths of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the outlooks of stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flat, the credit range has expanded and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when Fed is promoting politics.
In general, companies that conduct most of their business in the United States win after the increase in interest rates and local products become more attractive.
An international company with a lot of debt will get worse, as the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market and their debt will also be greater.
"History shows that the "quality" of the action tends to prevail over the three months after the initial increase in rates," analysts Goldman Sachsve said in a customer report.
Firms with strong balance sheets faced poor development companies in each increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004 on an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital outputs, as well as low-volatility stocks, also exceeded their counterparts lower quality on average by 4 (percentage points), and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
The debt is going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of mobile interest rates lose most, said Goldman.
Besides purely action games, consumers also strive for the rising dollar.
Soldiers can also see their profits through higher yields, but experts have different opinions on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, a hard-earned Ambassador Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised this station for "depression"
The view remains that the more undiscovered he is than his commercial rival
He also focuses on BBC Music Awards and says they're just cheating on the British
Ambassador Damien Collins attacked Voice and says he's not the original idea.
BBC Radio 3 "changes" in Classic FM, claims the first MP and gathers fresh pressure on the broadcast to prove that they are doing something that commercial broadcasts are not doing.
Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC leaders that the public service broadcasting station seems to be "accused" and is more unrecognizable than his business opponent.
"Radio 3 seems to be--I don't like using the word "depressed"--but it seems to be changing to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards that started last year seemed to be Britain under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that attack me, when you're actually just imitating what we already have on the market," said Bingham.
The director-general of the BBC's indictment rejected the argument that BBC Radio 3 is far from his business opponent in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 would not teach on any other radio.
And their commitment to live music and the creation of music is actually at peak level.
"I think that the commitment of Radia 3 to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important," he says.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to engage the audience than before, because the British are less educated than classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only factor in BBC production that got under fire because of smuggling to commercial competitors during the broadcast of Culture, Media and Sport and got to the hearing of the Commission.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical talent show that BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated cost of £22 million.
See why this program is being discussed as a non-original and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the stars of Paloma Faith aBoy George as a judge - was produced "as typical for BBC."
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find a hit from its own state" when he next started a fun series.
However, he refused to exclude the ordering of several future series of The Voice series or the loss of money from licensing fees to other entertainment formats.
Internet sales are growing at the slowest pace since August and may be guilty on Black Friday
The first three months of 2015 recorded 7% increase in online sales
Last month the lowest growth has been recorded since the year 2000 started the record itself
Internet sales increased three years ago due to mobile purchasing
Experts believe that November Black Friday could be the reason for the interruption of the loss
For more than a decade, virtual shopping was on the rise and, thanks to it, many of the British main streets became cities of spirits.
However, experts claim that there are signs of online sales installation, and new data show a seven-percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total August expenditure was the lowest growth increase since the beginning of the 2000 measurement, with an increase of only 5 per cent compared to last year.
Experts claim that there are signs of online sales fixing, and new data show a seven-percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the growth level in the past years and go back to 2000, the situation has always been rationalized over time," says the Guardian Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG Market Index.
It explains that internet sales were strengthened three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that people were able to buy online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the couch.
But now (growth) is slowing down, and that's why it looks like it's slowing down.
The phenomenon of the Black Friday, which was conquered from America, is quoted as one of the reasons for the decrease in sales.
Experts believe that customers could keep purchases before this event, which will take place last Friday in November.
Last year, five times more than the average buyers turned to their computers to arrange purchases and agree to several sales websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, through which buyers recontract, can keep customers from other purchases
A research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of each £5 was lost online.
For some products such as television and laundry, more than a third of the sales are carried out via web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online, instead of buying in stone fashion stores.
Muslims buried the victims of the fall of the mine in Mecca and the family of Bin Ladina was sentenced
The bodies of 29 dead were transferred by the streets of the Muslim during the first burial in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partially blames the collapse of the construction magnet Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health has stated that a total of 394 people were also injured after the earthquake
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of a fall in the Great Mosque in Mecca.
Dressed to a certain degree in white, the mourners chose the road and gave up respect to the victims when the first of the fallen came on their last way to the graves in Al-Moais.
The sad message went through a holy place, where only a few days earlier, the construction site fell to the top of the mosque and turned to the believers.
The body was released for burial, and the Saudi king sentenced the building group of bin Ladina over the disaster, which also left 394 wounded.
The bodies of 29 dead after the fall of the hives in Grand Central Moscow in Mexico were carried by the streets
Among the dead was the father of four Qasim Akram children from Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first journey when the tomb was broken.
Mr. Akram was in Grand Moscow with his parents before the start of the annual haj journey.
The Saudi officials have already promised that the Hague will be held in Mecca, and thousands of people are still entering the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group shouldn't have left the shoulder of an ash upstairs when it wasn't in operation.
The Arab version of the statement, along with the state operated by the Saudi Press Agency, indicates that Binladin Group is partly blamed.
The English service of the disc agency did not disclose this detail, but stated that the heads of the company were forbidden to travel abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to discover what caused the fall of the mine into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims cover before the Hadj journey later this month.
Binladin Group did not issue any declaration on the collapse of the mine and its representative was not made available for comment.
Royal rulings also accused the group of not using the latest security measures and lack of coordination with weather officials.
The tens of graves surround Grand Moscow in Mekce, which is part of the massive construction effort in front of Binladin Group.
Binladin's family has been in the vicinity of the Saudi ruling family for decades and is carrying out large construction projects.

Chief B&Q argues that Eastern European traders are already working for a cheap trend
The British continue to employ more handicrafts, according to Veronica Laura
The number of trained traders from Eastern Europe is behind the growth point
As a result, 200 Screwfix shops focused on traders are open
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets all over the country
Rupert Steiner, lead correspondent for Daily Mail
Brits take off the bets and skiers and hand them over to trained Eastern European traders to work at home.
If you're dealing with a bet or a painter's bet, you seem to be in a minority today.
Because the British are still working more and more to do cutting work at home, according to the company's head of Screwfix B&Q.
Veronica Laury, the new executive director of Kingfisher, who owns a home network, claims that the large increase in the number of trained traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores focused on traders and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms. Laura claims that she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the shop do better half.
Most male workers are currently employed.
She said there was a need to address rising demographic trends, which show more female households that make more domestic adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laura says, "We still work in shops with most men.
We need to get closer to balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women who make 80% of the decision regarding the purchase of goods.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laura, who is one of only five women in the company's leading cormorants according to the British FTSE100 index, also restructured her team to reflect equality between men and women.
Kingfisher is almost alone in that he has half the representation of women between employees including executive and financial directors.
Mrs. Laura claims: "It was a conscious decision - the diversity is an important topic here.
So it wasn't hard to find the good women we'd take to us.
Kingfisher announced a loss as a profit in half of the year and sold after the group took the cost of closing the stores.
As a result of the Kingfisher trend, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, opens 200 new shops
Prosinic contribution of 600 crowns to pensioners is in danger.
"It is the justice of equal wheat, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Mayor TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek, who stressed the principle of accountability.
The President of the ODS Zbyněk Stanjura said that a one-time contribution is sounding good, but it would be better for the long term to be in standard valuation, because it would be too late.
"We have room to find the mechanism we'll arrange," Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal by Minister Michael Marks (CSSD), which was to be valued next year over the scope of the law.
Marks argued that it would improve the social situation of pensioners who do not think they are pink.
The higher valuation next year would mean a budget impact of 5.5 billion crowns, and ministers are debating each trillion.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) recalled that in the past, the rate of valuation has decreased.
The rapporteur, Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) pointed out that the proposal did not address the reduction of real income in 2016 and later.
This right of payment in December makes it very complicated and perhaps impossible, he said.
The president of the ČSSD Roman Sklenák MPs therefore proposed a shorter deadline for the discussion of the norm in the committee for 10 or 20 days, and also blocked that right.
But the committee will have a month instead of two ordinary ones.
The bonus should amount to a total of 1.73 billion crowns.
Money is to go from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs in particular.
In the next year, the income should increase on average about the stockpiles.
The contribution should be made according to the income novelty of people who will have a claim for income or part of it in December.
They could get it, as could those who lost their pension claim in December before they paid it.
However, they would have to apply for the supplement in writing, not later than the end of next year.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are regularly valued by January, which is about price growth and a third of real wages growth.
This year, the pension corresponds to 41.5 percent gross pay, next year it should be 40.5 percent.
According to state final accounts 314,7 billion kroner, the state's old-age income was about five billionaires per year.
Expenditure on old-age income was 26 per cent of all budget expenditure and 46 per cent of all statutory expenditure.
The average full retirement income increased from last year according to data in the state final account of 104 to 10,714 crowns.
The Czech Social Security Administration has secured the payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and approximately 17,000 moderate-income pensions.
Jaquinin has abandoned his plans for a political career, he's going to dedicate himself to science.
The Senate chair, however, had a billionaire according to the Russian media quite certain.
In the Council of the Federation, he was to represent the Zapadorus Kaliningrad Region, whose Governor Nikolaj Cukanov, as the candidate of the government, the United Russia, held its post in Sunday's elections with a review.
According to the Russian laws, senators do not elect citizens, but they choose the governor from three candidates, whose name will be announced before the governor's elections.
After the election, the senator of three candidates will choose for himself.
The complication for Jacuzzi was that in the Kaliningrad area for 20 years he didn't do as required by the law.
The Kremlin found an exception for Jaconina, with the exception of being an extraordinary and empowered ambassador, on which the legal requirement for a long-term stay does not apply.
The Czech comedy Theory tiger's film is over.
The last drop in the chairmanship of the main hero is the voluntary death of his aunt, to whom power and patience came.
Granny - Iva Janžur has discussed grandfather's life, age and burial.
Jan is clear that he is on a similar path with his wife, Olga - Eliška Balzer.
He remembers that once he had his own will and dreams, he wants to live again with dignity and freedom.
He strives to regain the government over his life - and as a solution to his choice of escape from this present, he led to the story of Slavik.
Bajgar wanted to capture a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role would be to Bartošk, with whom he had already collaborated on the Invisible series.
However, an actor who appeared before the camera after a long pause associated with the rehab after a serious illness surprised him.
We made a deal three years ago.
I gave him the script and he said he likes how sad he is.
And he surprised me that he's probably a fucking sportsman.
For example, before the filming, he always asked where he was going to sit.
This time he rode on his bike, walked on the stairs, and even walked up the hill.
And that's all in the record tropical weather, the director's undercover.
According to Bartoška, women take a tiger to make a rabbit.
They're gonna feed him a little bit, but they're gonna close the door so he doesn't think he's gonna play outside the rabbit shop on a tiger.
And that's what we're trying to tell our film, the actor commented.
His wife, who can act slightly negatively on the viewers, made Eliška Balzer.
She's not just a negative character.
She's also nice, smart, empathic, and she thinks it's good.
But at the same time, she's an intruder and wants her husband to be put to death, undermining Bajgar.
The film parallels the fates of Jan's married daughter Olinka and Allenka - Táňa Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová - and the daughters of Erika and Pepika - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The film producer is Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producer Česká TVe and Rzłas and Tvízia Slovensko.
Google promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
The US Internet company Google has promised to provide up to $5.5 million (CZK 132.6 million) to organisations that help thousands of refugees streaming to Europe.
She announced it on Tuesday at Google.org, which is a charitable relationship between this internet company.
Azerbaijan cancelled Telick's part of the visit to criticism of human rights violations.
The Czech Member of the European Parliament for the movement of the UN, Pavel Telicka, has postponed a Thursday's journey to Baku because the Azerbaijani authorities have now cancelled the official part of his visit.
According to Telika, this is why the EP resolution last week criticises the violation of human rights in Azerbaijan, which Telika was a co-author.
By decision of the Azerbaijani party, Telicka discussed the possibility of talks with official partners and also the visit of political prisoners, which depends on the approval of the authorities, explained in his press statement by his Brussels office.
The road, which was planned several months ago, was intended to use Telicka to meet with the leadership of parliament and executive representatives, and also with representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, clarified the text sent by the CTC.
The EP resolution condemns "invisible repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
She called on European representatives to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political prosecution.
The resolution was adopted shortly after the recent decision on Azerbaijani opposition journalist Chadijjo Ismail, who was committed to discovering corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out that it builds its air base in Syria.
Bogdanovski did not exclude from his visit Novosibirsk that the Russian air base in Syria would be established in the future.
We don't have plans like that yet.
But nothing's been excluded, he said.
Russia already has an airport base in the port of Tartus in Syria, which has been more used as a service and logistics centre.
According to the Russian press, but from the beginning of August, supplies of Russian weapons and military material to Syria stood firm.
According to Moscow, the arms shipments resulting from the existing trade agreements are:
The Pentagon claims that the Russians intend to establish an air base in Latakia, which for the time being remains the heritage of Syrian President Bashar Asad.
But Washington does not have a very clear view of Russia's specific military intentions in Syria, American commentators agree.
US Foreign Minister John Kerry spoke to Russian counterpart Serge Lavrov on Tuesday about the situation in Syria, and it has been their third telephone interview in the last ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is released to Moscow to explain concerns about the gathering of the Russian arsenal near Israel.
The White House speaker Josh Earnest marked Asada's support for the loss of his bet on Moscow.
Russia's policy objectives in Syria have declared them to be more unclear.
According to him, Moscow made its satellite out of Syria.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a longer-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, is not quite clear.
The war in Syria is to be the main theme of Putin's talk, according to today's speculation of the Russian press, at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly in New York.
On the contrary, the Russian leader does not intend to speak of the situation in Donbasa.
According to The New York Times today's report, the American government does not rule out that President Barack Obama and the Russian President could meet at the United Nations meeting.
Opinions between White House counselors are still taking place.
The Tass agency today, referring to the words of the Kremelian speaker Dmitry Peskov, wrote that Putin had not yet had a meeting with Obama on his New York residence program.
Put the sesame oil on the stomach diet, the rope helps to strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the strain of unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra paneon oils.
All healthy substances will remain in the oil when the seeds are harvested.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as gums.
Some extra paneon oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, these are the most common cause of Czech death for several years.
The gallbladder bites mainly women, helping with sesame oil.
If you are one of the lovers of Asian cuisine, you must not miss a sesame oil, which is part of the original recipe for exotic food.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in heat-adjusted meals and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used during the chewing gum diet.
The essential fatty acids that contain are good prevention of the formation of yellow stones.
These are 90% of the cause of jaundice infections, and women suffer from these difficulties 3 times more often than men.
In general, problems with the stomach are particularly affecting people with overweight who do not carry and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can also be used with success in liver diet, which is very similar to that of the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits that this oil consumes, they should pay attention to products from exotic foods.
Producers from Asia often use overripe seeds that have a more pronounced taste.
Oil, however, is about all the active substances, according to Ladislav Haczecký, the Czech executive director of Bohemia Oil from Kraslic to Sokolovska, which produces bio-pane oil sold for cold.
The company also produces new sesame oil and uses unsolicited seeds of white sesame.
In an hour, our fox will be able to hatch 8 kilos of sesame.
The raw material is heated by mechanical polishing up to 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for marking extra pannetic.
At higher temperatures there would be a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil thrives in the heart and stomach disease.
The Czech favorite among the oil is the sunflower.
The research Jarmily Hamerské, who led the University of Masaryk, revealed that he preferred it in a warm kitchen of 43% respondents.
However, it is not really suitable to crush, but it starts to overheat at 180 °C.
It is better to use it, for example, to swallow salads and it is especially suitable for dieting, where it helps to prevent cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which reduce cholesterol levels from all fatty acids most.
In the case of heart problems, attention should be paid to the amount of total intake of fat and calories.
For example, in one spoon of sunflower oil there are 62 calories, in the spoon of rape oil there are 99 calories.
With regard to the energy value of food, it is important to realize that food with nutrients is much more suitable than so-called free calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
That's why it's appropriate to pick up extra virgin oils.
The sunflower lasts as much as the moon and the moon for nine months.
The storage in the refrigerator is still prolonged.
Old oil people know especially from the top taste.
On the contrary, there's no loophole at the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
Common oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of the technical rope are used for so-called superfoods, and therefore the rope oil is considered to be the most healthy of plant oils.
For this labelling, thanks to the maximum content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot produce themselves and must be taken from food.
Especially important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
A study of scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, instead the Icelandic take 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Common oil is appropriate to be included in the food container as part of a diet that supports strengthening immunity and healing wounds.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential component of cell membranes.
People don't have to worry about using rope oil, they don't have any psychoactive substances.
The fact that he found this oil way to consumption confirms the fact that Bohemia Oil is one of the most sold.
He sells 500 liters a year.
People often use one lie after the wound.
The coconut oil is not very tasty, but it greatly enhances immunity, advises Daniel Vlček of Bohemian beauty company Oil.
According to statistics, they're the most passionate nation of American barbecuers.
There's 1.4 grills in one house.
Then all over the world, there are the most diverse competitions in grilling, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
They're not even Czech.
On the basis of consumer research in the Czech market, we find that only 4% of the people in the world were not involved.
The absolute majority then grilled several times a year.
To make the grilling successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to adjust the seams several hours before the heat adjustment.
Which oil is most suitable for this, and at the same time, when grilling, will leave the health of a beneficial substance?
It is generally true that in the same grilling process, you should keep your mouth shut.
Experts agree that a large part of the oil begins to lose its taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra paneon oils then also come into the body of a beneficial substance, which is otherwise obtained in the consumption of oil from foods modified at lower temperatures.
This does not mean, however, that extra virgin oils will not find their application when grilling.
Terrible oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When meat is said, a terrible oil is immediately supplied to experts from Bohemia Oil from Kraslic to Sokolovsk.
Well, that's a great addition to the taste of meat and fish.
In the kitchen there is a unique feature of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for roasting and grilling because it has a high burning rate up to 216 °C.
Even at such high temperatures, as one of the few oils preserves the health of a beneficial substance, describes the benefits of the terrible oil Daniel Vlček from Bohemia Oil, which belongs to a few Czech producers of this oil from the viné.
Experts agree that rose oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains high levels of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in the fight against cholesterol surplus.
Our body also accepts important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals in a terrible oil.
Due to the favourable content of these substances, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increase metabolism, and have a positive effect on the kidneys.
We also help to increase our outer beauty - it improves skin elasticity, is used in the treatment of liver and helps to care for dry and creamy hair.
The chefs commend themselves for using the vegetable oil in the kitchen.
Not only is it suitable for the preparation of cold meals, for example, when cooking salads, but also for the heating of meals.
In grilling, then, it can be used immediately in two ways, in marinating and themselves grilling.
We keep the fish and the meat and the fish safe.
Three ingredients must be present: oil, acidity and root.
For example, we add acid to the apple vinegar, and we target the mixing of the meat.
The root adds a lot of flavor and oil preserves and supplies the right crop, says Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, it adds that the horrid oil is ideal for navigation because, as one of the few oils, it can break through the dark mass.
Marined meat or fish are ready for grilling, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are indicated by the fact that only a few capes are sufficient to prepare meals.
The same applies to grilling.
Some oils are for this way of preparing a straight taboo.
This is particularly true of wet, wet and dry oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before the grilling itself, shake the oil, prevent the burning of food.
The essential part of the grilling is also the preparation of the annexes.
The grilled mass and fish fit practically anything - grilled vegetables, baked bread, light vegetable salad and many others.
The chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, to salad the Hot Summer.
You need: • 1 pcs of broccoli • 1 chain of hands • 1 cup of curded currant • 1 cup of mixture of salad leaves • 3 tablespoons of grape oil
Add to the salad meat to a mixture of salad leaves with a towel, curded curds, and on large cubes with a towel.
Depending on the taste of salt and opera, you can also taste the mint chilli and soy sauce.
Finally, dig a few drops of rose oil.
For an exceptional taste, then you can salad with finely cooked almonds.
Several sclerosis: not only depends on doctors, but also on the patient’s willingness to fight.
Several sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of experts: neurologist, physiotherapist, ergotherapy, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis also need consultation if they are to have a child, care for these patients also include social counseling, recommendations on accommodation, etc.
However, all of this is not enough: the development of the disease can affect the patient itself in a fundamental way.
The more he fights disease, the longer he can work, the more he doesn't have to change the style of his life.
As doctors have pointed out, the patient’s commitment to the disease makes room for activity.
For example, it has been shown that regular movement significantly distances the time when the patient needs some compensation, such as a shelter.
It is important that patients and their surroundings do not suffer from various myths, such as that the disease is automatically leading to the end of the vehicle.
And that's why the website Give your chance (www.bezmytu.cz) that is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give your chance.
The most important person in caring for a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In a number of sclerosis, it has been suggested twice that the sooner the disease begins to heal, the more the doctor can influence.
This is because we have medications for multiple sclerosis at an inert stage, when the process of neurodegeneration is not yet so strong.
The sooner we get hit, the greater the hope is that we will be able to stop the disease and remove the disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitation care, which most often solves the weakness of the lower limbs or imbalances.
He works with the sick according to their individual needs: keeping the condition, improving the path, strengthening the pancreas, reducing swallowing disorders or improving coordination.
"It's really individual, depending on the specific patient's difficulties," says MUDr. Martina Kövári, the primary clinic of rehabilitation and physical medicine Faculty of Hospitals in Motole.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it occurs a little differently in each way.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always reduce its symptoms.
However, mobility also strengthens the immune state of the organism, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive regular exercise is the fact that the sick are verifying what they can do, and it enhances their self-confidence.
"Endorphines are also washed out during exercise, and a person feels good about it," warns PhDr. Kamila Rásová from the Rehabilitation Clinic of the Faculty of Hospitals of the Royal Vineyard.
By influencing the physical page, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotion.
That's how we get into the psyche and the immune processes, and we stabilize the disease, it adds.
"These patients were previously treated so-called, today we know they need a targeted burden," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, the priority of Rehabilitation Clinic and Body Medicine Faculty Hospital in Motole.
The aim of physiotherapy is to keep a person as self-sufficient as long as possible, including employment.
Physical therapists therefore cooperate with ergot therapists so that everyone gets compensation aid with his ear in peace.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or a psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult life situation.
If you get a serious illness, most people will get it.
They're in shock, panic, fear.
He has to respond to a great burden - loss of health.
With such a sick soul, we have to follow someone, not try to get rid of everything in our own misery.
"I work with them in such a way that they finally conclude that even with the disabled, life can be meaningful and that a number of sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubert from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague latecoeer manufacturer, airbuses wouldn't fly.
Aviation production is a synonym for accuracy and advanced technologies.
New aircraft are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials, which can't be manufactured and processed immediately.
However, alongside super-precious, computer-controlled machines, along with autoclaves for composing composites, it is possible to hit something as common as merune peaks.
In the drum, which reminds us of a sugar vat, in a pile of ovens the edges of the stains that have just come out of the milling machine are popular.
"No one has come to a better conclusion," smiles Ivan Dubský, Director General of the manufacturer of the latecoeer air gates of the Czech Republic.
In the area in Prague, the previous Summer complete door for Airbus A320 is produced.
As the only ones in the world, they're delivering doors to Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors, which are part of Prague, also enter passengers into the first and higher class on the upper decks of the largest aircraft of the Airbus A380.
Here are the doors full of compositions for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Preciseness is the main motto here.
Maybe the current key leaves the company to settle twice a year.
If the yellow sticker is missing a check record, the Prague competition should explain to the auditors from Airbus or Boeing who drive regularly whether the doors are manufactured in accordance with the agreed rules.
But advanced technology has not completely changed.
On one door to A320 there are 1500 knots.
The netizens have to cut their hands.
It takes them two days.
And according to the sound of the impacting bet, they know if it's already properly detached.
The tolerances in which they move are minimal.
The net may rise from zero to 0.13 millimetres above the surface of the aircraft.
That's about twice the fat of human hair.
A number of trained hmats come to control.
When the controller goes through a row of nuts, he'll know if he's out of tolerance.
Then we'll take the exact angle.
This year, the L-39 training programme was held before 1989.
But in 1991 neither was produced.
The company had to find new orders quickly.
At that time, it was combined with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
Wins selection on emergency door suppliers for model A321.
The deals with Boeing weren't so happy.
"We were for them at that time a small company that had not enough money to invest and that Boeing could guarantee long-term stable deliveries," Dubsk recalls.
The door to the US producer would remain open if Latvia did not attend the Prague International Association of the French Latecoeer Group in 1999.
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
The second day, the conversation with France spread, says Dubsk.
About a year later, Latecoeer bought the Czech company and with a strong company came new orders.
The installation of the parts of the door for A320 was immediately expanded in 2000.
Three years later, the upper deck door for A380 was opened.
In 2006 the company built a new hall for the processing of compositions for Boeing Dreamliner supplies.
Without Latecoere, we wouldn't be able to do these big orders ourselves.
Maybe we'd do a piece or a little part.
Partners want security supplies for twenty or thirty years, explains Dubsk.
Last year, the Czech Latecoeer achieved a turnover of over 2.9 billion and profits after taxing 147 million crowns.
The exclusive position between the supplier of aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere has invested 1.5 billion crowns in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, 170 special manufacturing processes and certificates of qualification for key employees.
Without them, the firm would not have built any doors to the aircraft.
To obtain certificates that the production processes meet the requirements of customers, and to maintain them in repeated checks shall be held in accordance with the Dublin millions of crowns.
Production processes change every year.
They're more precise and tighter.
We need to train employees, equip the equipment and re-certify the whole process, he adds.
The company is now finalizing the process of decomposition with zinc and nickel, which replaces the present harmful cadmium for human health.
They got the job from the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt the technology for the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
People from Boeing are coming, checking the concepts of the whole line.
Then we'll run their production.
They're checking our lab, too.
One set of samples are tested by themselves in their laboratories and then the results are compared to ours, approaching the Deep way the receivers control them.
In return, the Prague companies are long-term exclusive contracts.
The Prague race is standing today and the embryo production is falling.
For A320, it produces half of the total volume of the door.
The replacement of the Czech Latecoere is impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European producer.
But it doesn't mean he could say any price at the door.
Part of the contract is a price curve.
It shows how many doors one will stand after ten, fifty, hundreds of pieces made.
The price per piece is still lower to a certain limit value.
We've got to get into this price sample.
If not, we'll win, says Dubsky.
Half of the hall, where electric boxes are completed for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft, is still empty.
But it's a symbol of the future.
Under the wall, a new semi-robotic line is being built for use and installation door for an innovative model A320 Neo.
It's fast and exploding.
"This is the trend that the assembly in flight takes off," Dubsky adds.
The rest of the line is secured.
Airbus reports that airlines have so far ordered 3278 pieces of a new A320 model.
Only a few meters away will create a line for complete mounting door for upper deck A380.
It's our parent company's strategic decision.
The aim is to shorten production times and reduce costs.
Full installation could begin within two years, says Dubský.
Before doing so, however, the company must pass the qualification tests necessary for the installation of some electrical and electronic devices into the door for the largest Airbus.
The company is also committed to further development of the production of composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it should also be part of the new Airbus A350 programme, which will compete with the American Dreamline.
"It is a huge credit for the company when it can process compositions in addition to metal materials," Dubský says proudly.
Latecoere, however, is being acquired on the basis of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There's no other place in Letov's area where he's staying.
Prior to the entry of the French mother, the company had 180 employees.
Now he's 800 and within three years it could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are ahead of schedule, the number of new aircraft each year does not have to be alarmed.
Although he had orders for several years in advance, the parent company of Prague's latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group didn't have enough money to pay for the loan.
Latecoere finally managed to negotiate with the main believers.
At the end of August, a part of the loan was exchanged for a share.
The creditors received an increase of EUR 57.4 million in the company's share of 37.4 per cent.
The company's debt fell by two thirds, which is 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company signed a new shareholding of EUR 222.9 million between existing shareholders.
In total, this raised the basic capital of EUR 280 million.
However, the whole group is looking forward to the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which accounts for 85 percent in the markets.
The average contract growth is expected by four per cent per year until 2017.
The contract book has orders of 2.6 billion euros, corresponding to the four-year production.
The French media argues that latecoere can breathe again after years in the capacitors.
The Czech race in Prague is important for groups.
The Group contributes 16 percent to the market.
According to the number of employees, the largest foreign group is.
The envoys supported a greater share of the state's carbon charges.
The change in interest rates for the interest rate is due to bring in a government deposit of 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
According to the Government, the budget revenue of the municipalities should have a neutral impact because the fee should be higher.
In the year preceding, the municipalities received around 450 million crowns and the state budget of 150 million crowns.
From the coal industry, there were about 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns.
The novela is also calculated by increasing the remuneration from the area of production with a permissible weight of thousands of crowns per hectare per year.
The receipt of these grants shall continue to be to the full extent of the municipalities.
Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told the MPs that this resulted in a total of 14 million to 100 million crowns per year.
The amount of the fee will no longer be fixed by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
Recalculated as a component of the amount of depleted malts and rates for individual types of malts.
According to the government, the change is due, inter alia, to a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, the envoy of the ODS Marek Benda warned that the establishment of a fee by the government regulation should not be in accordance with the constitution.
According to Minister Mádka, however, the tax is not in this case because the state is paying the interest that is a state's property.
Fees shall be granted only to the countries whose territory is affected.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the county and a quarter of the state will receive.
The same will be true in the case of radioactive mountains.
The part of the money that is made at the expense of the fee will be objectively bound.
For example, 28 per cent will have to go to repair damage after recovery or to ensure the banishment service.
Today's proposal was criticised by the opposition MPs, who claimed in particular that they would harm the villages affected by greed and countries.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Starostov) warned that businesses would no longer want to sponsor the municipalities just as much as they do today because they would pay higher fees directly to the government budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," said David Kádner (Usvit) elected in Austria.
Before the increase in unemployment in Mostecka, the KSČM MP, Hana Aulická, warned.
Kádner and Aulička were unsuccessfully proposing to reject the novel, but Kučera wanted the law to return to the government to work.
The explanatory report states that, according to the companies concerned, the increase in fees does not lead to carbon prices, as prices are more than 90 per cent long-termly agreed.
The main consumers, such as electricity or heating, should therefore not feel an increase in prices.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that trade unions will compensate for the increase in wages to reduce their operating costs, which in particular would mean reducing the number of employees," the government admits.
According to it, however, the increase in wages from the point of view of employment is difficult.
According to the report on the new Milan Urbana (ČSSD), it is key for Members to know the conclusions regarding the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limit values for coal.
If coal reaches beyond the limits, it will have an impact on income for the country and the country, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Youth that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovakian army should fall until 2020.
The limits at the bottom of the ČSA should be broken for social, national and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time to decide on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching the US Federal Reserve meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a fundamental decision on whether to increase interest rates first after almost a decade.
A study of 80 economists under the Reuters agency found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now believe that they would remain inactive for some time and leave interest rates of 0-0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been sitting for years since the Fed reduced its rates to zero.
First, we are approaching a situation where the main central bank could be able to get out of zero flights and start the process of normalising interest rates," says Angel Ubide, head of Peterson Institute for the International Economy.
The American economy was relatively good, there was a reinstatement in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the state's accounts and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, Fed cannot ignore a less pink global perspective.
They warned markets to be ready for an increase, but circumstances suggest that they also see a great chance against this step.
The decision is to be notified on Thursday 20:00 SEC.
The shooter at Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later on the same day as his colleague - wrote a message stating that he was "flight" his first murder and that he wanted to be able to take it back, revealed it to government authorities on Tuesday.
Police in Gautiera in Mississippi reported that Lamb, a professor of geography and social sciences at the State University of Delta, called the police on Monday morning about ten o'clock
And he said he shot someone.
Lamb's dispatcher asked him to send the cops to his house.
He said, "Last night I shot my wife" and also mentioned that there is a "pure dog" in the house, which "will not upset anyone", but is upset.
The police demanded the name of the caller, but Lamb didn't introduce himself.
Lamb also didn't explain why he was shooting at the house.
When the police arrived at the scene, 41 - year - old Amy Prentiss found a handwritten message from Lamb saying: “I’m so sorry and wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she's the only person who ever loved me."
After leaving the message, Lamb left his way to Delta University for 300 miles, where he killed the history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
William LaForge, a graduate of the university, said that he did not know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "there was obviously something in Mr. Lamb's head."
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss's romantic relationship with Schmidt, government authorities stated that there was "no evidence" about the "loving triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentis in seven years, said she was "a great person".
There was a divorce 15 years ago, but both of them remained friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was the whole case "crushed".
O'Steen said that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as Sun Herald reported, worked with Prentiss from the house over the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentissova, who had a hunting dog named Blesk, had been with Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," she let Knowles hear.
The police stated that Lamb had spoken to his relatives on Monday and said he would not go to prison.
When the police caught him on the street near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and ran into the woods where he was shot.
According to a biography published on the school’s website, Lamb won a PhD in the field of education at Delta University in spring 2015.
The stars that have lost their magic
Herec (left), on the picture with his son Redmond (right), has several stressful years behind him.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and lost his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett for cancer in 2009.
He also reportedly had a drug problem, and in 2008 he was detained for drug possession.
All these things are certainly choosing their own tax.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be a couple of months out of the game for a double break.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during the Manchester United defeat in the League of Masters against the PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defender left this injury in tears and removed it from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks that Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The wound caused an unprecedented move by Héctor Morena in 15 minutes when a 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV space.
Nine minutes was treated at the playground and an oxygen mask was also needed before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's had a double leg fracture and now he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe in the afternoon and then operated in Manchester.
It's a terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester in 18 years it's very hard, but it's fantastic and then this happens.
When he was in the closet, he also had an oxygen mask.
He's crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture requires six months of treatment and will not be able to play in the group phase.
I believe he's still playing this season.
Moreno was very lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty cup.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish Mexicans.
Van Gall pointed out that the Italian judge was wrong.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad move on both feet.
Tweet from Shaw's account says, "Thanks to everyone for their news, words can't express how destroyed I am, my journey to recovery begins now and I will return even stronger."
Related: Manchester United recorded Luke Shaw's injury in defeating PSV
The British defender will have added motivation to the reintroduction in the form of the European Championships in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, coach PSV, said, "It was a very serious injury."
If any player leaves the game with such injury, each one is very sad.
It's never the goal of our players to hurt the opponents.
Moreno suffered a broken leg in the struggle for Mexico against Van Gaalov Dutch at the 2014 World Championship.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponents, and when you hear about the seriousness of such an injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I wasn't able to shake this moment.
I saw only the ball that directed the other way, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched him, but I didn't see a move on Luke.
In the SBS6 interview, Morena said, "I know how he feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel so bad about it, I'm so sorry.
Player PSV Andrés Guardado was also transferred to the hospital after Chris Smalling's move.
David Cameron certainly knows The Lorax better?
This is what every parent knows: When a child loves a book, it doesn't take long to learn to remember.
You can't be David Cameron.
On the question of children's schematics to name a favorite children's book, the president of the Government of Lorax, a story from Dr. Seuss of 1971.
It was difficult to choose, Cameron writes in a report published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "Writable, funny, creative and with strong content, I loved reading to my children because there was always a picture or message behind it that I had not seen before."
Well, until then, in the following paragraph, Cameron reportedly described the story of the book according to the 2012 film elevator, which added other characters and details to fill out the brief original text.
"In the town of Thneed-Ville surrounded by a wall, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even air is a compost, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl's dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see the real tree," is a book that records the object of love unknown Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if the same was not quite suspicious, the text added by Cameron is read as a total elevator of the Lorax film, which is on the website of the Internet Movie Database, and begins by saying: "In the town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature ceased to exist, and even air is a compost, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his girl dreams, Audrey."
Because he was openly a practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would get to know the story of a book, where the so-called young man would learn that the local nature is ravaging the Countess, the trees of the Once-ler industrialist, who despite protests by the title Lorax, the cut-off, the scoundrel who "speaks about the trees."
With the highest probability of so little significant PR task, an assistant who has never read Lorax's child 20 times in a piece.
Speaker Downing Street said that the text was probably coming from Cameron's stairs office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text provided the employee of Cameron, but without another comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of warning England, but still holding
To compete with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after looking at the team that England has chosen on this tour, I think the rewinding of defeat 3-0, which she suffered last in the trial series, is unlikely.
Neither would I rule out the guest victory directly.
The side of Alastair Cooka can be less experienced than that three years ago, but there are good spin players in this pancreatic complex and also collective thinking is strong; no scars from 2012, only youth positive.
With the ball is Moeen Ali developing with Spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the level of the test series, it represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth got out of the team of England in the series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to mention Adam Lyth is a hard one for me to analyze, because his main coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests were opposed to two good attacks under demanding conditions and simple, but the hard reality is that players are grounded in crickets on the basis of performance.
For example, there were no questions around the name Joe Root, which led to the announcement, because — and I have mentioned earlier — players are their best selections.
A few more decades and Lyth could have extended his series, but he had control of his own destiny.
Let's hope that if he manages to get more running for Yorkshire, another opportunity will appear.
The chief coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his position, even though his performance was not quite stopwatchy, and that doesn't surprise me; it was always a team player.
The question of how much test time the thumb gets to prove is a hard nut.
Lyth got seven heads — just like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance home and out.
The only thing you could do to stop it is that England gave Jonathan Trott’s first chance in the Caribbean — even though Lyth was in the best form — but this missed opportunity is already the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and this is a doll I value very well.
It's a x-factory cricket player that we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season when he won 236 against us on the Trent Bridge, which he did so little.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but all of this will, of course, depend on the overall composition of the United Arab Emirates.
The idea when Moeen starts on the side of Cook, which would get another extra spinner while keeping four quicks, was carried over and I don't have any excuses against her.
I don't understand why the strikemaker can't fire and this left-handed man has already shown himself to be a great cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but he was number three and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 trials before his release in 2001.
Immediately three centuries passed and he didn't even look.
The team comes to Zafar Ansari as a backup spinner, and when I had the chance to watch him, he took me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough statistics — on average 31 with a ball and 35 with a ball — and I see it as a mink, but there are not many spinners who raise their hands, and the electorate decided for the young.
They'll learn a lot about this tour.
Besides the team, England seems to have made several changes and smart additions to their training staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawardenea, Sri Lankan Colonel, as a consultant for test matches may be a master's move.
He is one of the most beautiful players who bring rich experiences by having experiences with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in the part of the white-ball tour and brings to the team both energy and unlovable.
I always felt that he was born directly into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he has an intelligence that can be used.
New voices in the closet, even though they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes relax and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham Ben Stokes's partner got a day off, just like Root got a similar break against Australia, and I don't have a problem with this decision.
Although many disagree, coaches and selectors do not produce a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such a decision can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy began to stagnate by 2017.
The thoughtless renegotiation strategy of David Cameron for maintaining Britain in the EU is getting into other problems with every passing day without the choice of genius Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn headed the Working Party, or comes to the TUC on Tuesday to bring the whole situation around Europe to a parade.
Foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Faragese.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is drowning in different crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have enough British self-central agendas, shared concessions and disruptive changes to treaties that most of them did not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided that they would not want it even if social protection had been disrupted.
We can even call it the self-agenda Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and the office go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolises, take a photo before the famous local monument, with or without local values, and then return home to the words that they win the reform alliances.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants Britain to be unaccompanied in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some short-term ministers and officials in some major cities have reached the point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, a German discreetly balanced office, is an associate, but she was in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it gets bad, as it was for too long thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French Francis Holland faces a re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is falling, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It's hard to see how they break their legs with the help of Selfie Brits, who could better invest their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - which is something they don't want themselves because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan deliberately useless SNP-style remarks during the campaign before the 2017 referendum in Britain to speed up the Brexit process, a hard friend.
"The renegotiation has solved the problem" and "Britishness has nothing to do with the negotiation."
Europeans are aware of their own harms as the Fleet Street can be and how skeptical they are of the EU's printing oligarch barons, because they were not during the referendum inspired by Tony Ben in 1975, which supported our 1973 entry in terms of 2:1.
They can remember the name Boris Johnson, a jumper Euro-opportunist who made his name as a Brussels reporter "EU straight bananas" in the early 1990s.
Despite his ingenuity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included mixtures of non-paying tax agents, foreigners hacking phones and pseudo non-sea departments, who owned most of the big news.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a gorilla, you have to throw her bananas so she doesn't get you to dinner and then tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameroon's reference routine since Blair allowed the principle of a repealed EU constitution, which was flooded by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and received a expulsion card.
The press never fired him either.
But my dear Jeremy Corbyn, who knocked on me on Monday in Westminster with friends - I told him that I should not waste any more time - seems to be in danger of accepting the strategy of Murdoch Neil Kinnock's boycott, which was wrong back then and now.
It may take some time, but it needs to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but with Andrew Marre, whose chair at the BBC left Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe, I'll say, it's kind, they're developing.
He claims to want to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people out of a mad Ukip trend and the wild coasts of Tory's little Englanderis can certainly come to this.
The same said Hilary "Bemm, but not Bennite" Benn on the radio and television this week, when his inner shoe couldn't decide to let Corby's appointment as a shadow officer was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970 ’ s when his old father fought on TV about his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's back was much more attractive.
But fighting for us to remain "under all circumstances" - Benin's phrase - according to all that was not what McDonnell said, nor what the JC told his colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background of them is, the sensitive image Corbyn wants to tell - do not forget, touched me too - the discipline of the news remains important in the age of daily television broadcasting and especially in faith, the parishioner paranoia and the betrayal of social media
It is fair not to grant Cameron a free entry into Europe, which would allow him to consider the support of the Working Party in the referendum campaign, of course, as McDonnell stated.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnello and Corby's fundamental proclamation of EU membership - in line with their Bennite-based economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric debate between left-wing dissidents, for which the narcissism of the small differences is the central basis of dogmatic harassment.
As with his statement about Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that JC's campaign will not want to end it - foreign diplomats will have to try to understand the meaning of it all for their domestic masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political capital - they also have suspected voters - because of British concessions when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the British "weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, and even by reducing the costs of the conservative government by power, as I was reminded at the Monday's start of something called the British Fly Security Forum.
Experts criticise the review of the electronic public agency Public Health England
The government's statement to the agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are connected to the tobacco industry, by researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet criticism of the evidence used in their report on electronic cigarettes of the Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE agency published the "mechanical" report last month and described it as "a comprehensive review of evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the extent of the data and pointed out the link between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The leader in Lancet's professional journal last month attacked the "extremely chattel base", on which the PHE agency founded its main conclusions.
Two other experts, who wrote for BMJ, questioned the claims that were allegedly "built on rocks or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They assume that the public could expect that the statement by the PHE agency, which is "the best estimate at the time, is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking", are based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from a meeting of 12 people authorised to prepare a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the damage associated with the various products containing nicotine; the results of the discussion were summarised in the research report.
McKee and Capewell state that one of the sponsors of this meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, whose director-general allegedly had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also approved the public health authority of BAT in the sustainability report, he said.
One of the 12 meeting participants granted funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but not from the financing that they allegedly received earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reason for selecting panel members is not available, but they contain a number of well-known electronic cigarettes champions, some of whom also declare industrial financing in the newspapers.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting in PHE was also attended by tobacco management.
The report emerges in this group "exultively admitting," missing "solid evidence of the harmfulness of most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these references or limitations are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that saying PHE "there is no evidence that e-cigarettes would act as a way to smoke for children or non-smoking," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being in PHE, stated that the claim in BMJ had already been held accountable.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
One of the two lifelong smokers will die because of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are small, but we still need to examine long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows, and also what they do not show, especially when there was so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die of smoking and smoking-related diseases a year, NHS is worth £2 billion a year.
A clear emphasis on current evidence - that even though e-cigarettes are not safe, they only carry a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should end with EastAnders, former director of Channel 4
Former Director Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop sending programs like EastAnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "give right hand" for an emergency show like Albert Square.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used for programs that are not created by other British television broadcasts.
He criticised the BBC for putting in public service programmes, which are likely to follow only a handful of people, in difficult broadcast times against its rivals "the biggest rating show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After Director-General Tony Hall said that the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he was unsuccessfully trying to connect with the BBC for six years that he worked on Channel 4.
"I'm fighting the idea that the BBC launches and broadcasts programmes that would certainly be broadcast to rivals without state contributions," Johnson said in the communication committee in the Upper House, as part of the BBC's future negotiations.
If you maintain licensing fees that I am not sure whether they are in the medium or long term good thinking, the production should be reduced at least in terms of programs that do not produce or produce other programs.
They send The Voice in the main broadcast time, because they want to get as wide as possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would send it is a funny joke, and obviously foolish.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why regressive tax should support programmes that can be financed without contribution.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course made on the home floor.
Frankly, the other channels would give them the right hand.
I can't understand how these public broadcasts are.
I don't think that would weaken the BBC at least.
Johnson, a serial businessman who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that he felt guilty about making ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here and believing that it was the best way to ensure long-term support."
His comment on the most popular BBC show repeats those who were former executive director Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that BBC sell a show like EastAnders.
Johnson said that even the more horrifying BBC public service programs "is passing on to BBC4, where very often obscurity cannot be measured, but they fill in their power and can argue when they are going to justify their cover mission to £4bn from license fees, "But of course we are doing all these screening programs that nobody is looking at."
They're sending them when no one's looking at them.
As for the license fee, Johnson said to the Commission: "I invite you to find a more regressive system about who gets the best value from it.
Of course, we all think that the 150 British pounds a year is a big sum, but for people who have 150 pounds a lot, I'd be surprised if they paid so much because they don't look so much at the BBC.
Former Director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who appeared in front of the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should review its Rheitov mission in the sense of "information, education and entertainment."
He confirmed that the small volume of BBC production has already been classified as education - it was 1% of television production and 0.1% of radio production - and should be taken as a model for public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "inform, explain and entertain."
About the Elstein partnership, he said the BBC should do more in areas like Proms, which were broadcast only on television, and connect with commercial reporters so that we can all see them online.
"Sonogenetics" or control of brain cells by sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction that the slide moves.
Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
A small slide changes direction at a time when sound impulses are affected, which are not audible to human ears.
Pulses function by switching cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to react to these ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists can read and write brain activity using light
Scientists have stated that these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenesis that uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla in California, told the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which the patient's brain is controlled by electrodes that stimulate the brain.
The glands usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction would be delivered when placed into the fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found out, bubbles strengthen ultrasound waves that then pass through the worm's body.
The enhanced ultrasound waves occur in the ion channels TRP-4, which are located in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells they are connected to, is reported in the journal Nature Communications.
In order to control the glands using ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of their motor neurons contain the ion channels TRP-4.
When he then used such modified worms ultrasound, sound waves were reinforced by microbubbles and transferred to worms where modified motor neurons were switched on.
The new method is much like optics, a progressive tool that allows scientists to turn off and shut down neurons using light.
Chalasani, however, had heard that sonogenesis could have many advantages against this technique.
Unlike the light that must be sent by optical fibre to the required place in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate the tissue without limitation and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that when we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment for the treatment of neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that his application would also be found in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture device - right on your threshold!
An adverts that hold the British arms trade.
Look at the video about the arms market from Amnesty International.
Terrible killer drone!
The nails on the legs that break the ankles!
Three-shots!
And electric stunning shoes that cause unbearable pain, but they don't touch any marks!
The joyful voice and caricature of metaphor leave no one in doubt that this advertising in the world's largest weapons fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to express the will of the British government to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the defense and security facilities of the International Veselice in the ExCeL Centre in the London district of Docklands.

But a solo campaign is also conducted with posters at bus stops and subways that require a second look.
"Important announcement, Traveling to DLR from September 15th to September 18th?" read one, using letters with a London meter label with DLR links becomes a picture of the tank.
This September, a series of arms dealers will join the DLR ... Customers are asked to help stop arms trade.
On 300 posters are created artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
The collective name Special Patrol Group has helped to distribute throughout London and using "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 per piece of Allen's key, which is supposed to "get access to about a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not required by this "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodys produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, the curator Cruel Designs and a professional assistant at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and are trying to show political activity to viewers outside the gallery.
Many artists go to work with activists in protest movements and realize that they have to get out of the real world in order to have their art impact on society.
Other anti-trafficking posters with health weapons travelling in the subway.
Video Amnesty was visited on Facebook by more than 100,000 people within 24 hours and was created by a VCCP agency working without charge for the honorary and graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
The creative director of VCCP Matt Lever would be surprised by the silent advertising about arms trade - saw an empty space in the calendar ExCeL - and thought, "Let's show them a campaign that's trying to avoid."
They played with the creation of more realistic risky corporate advertising, but "by adding sticky colors and animation, I have achieved that there are more people behind."
"They took a fantastic piece of work and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair," says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we need now is that the government of the United Kingdom takes action and ensures that the torture system does not deal illegally with our thirst.
Probably the most creative art surrounding arms trade comes from outside ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastic euphemistic products.
In the press report, Saab revealed an order from the US army to "at the AT4CS RS. "
This includes a "only-shaped head that provides amazing effects behind the burning inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Life at Student College
11 years ago, I moved to college as an unscrupulous 19-year-old boy, still believing in barty and moral relativism, but until now I have the heavy smiles of those I've been leading - and often long-standing complaints to others.
All I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving on to the wheels can move from slightly to the nerves of the moving to a completely depressing one.
It's kind of bluffing: tell people where you're from, if you've taken a year's break, what you're thinking about Corbyn and why "you don't truly love or hate Marmite, because people, it's just an extract from HAHAA, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help the others to breathe, too, ask yourself, and express your interest.
He's doing the conversation and he's gonna help you find the people you like, and the ones you wouldn't even have fun with if your races were in one fire and they're gonna release the extinguishers.
Let the people have space.
People's rooms often change for drinking receptions, movie evenings and public places, but they're also rooms in which people dress and adjust their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting to go to college and being in a relationship.
The Introverts on high will come shortly.
Your room should be a safe haven, yet a lot of people are turning around on an outdoor walking culture that is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendship.
It could be hell for someone who needs to be loaded.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so I can return to the energy I needed to talk to you."
Try to find out when your partner is tired of socialization - and maybe write him down instead.
When it's about chatting, chatting.
One boy in my neighborhood was used to saying that if the door's not locked, it's been invited inside.
He saw a few things.
Make friends through cooking.
Because you started going to the university at the top of the baker's handkerchief, knocking on the foreign door and showing with the plate sealed cookies seems rather less strange, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've got you something, now smile while I'm going to ask myself about personal questions."
Offering domestic insights is a good way to find friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you, and maybe everything will end so that your face will contribute to a pleasant surprise.
Of course, you're a decent baker.
Badly condensed pieces of flour, sugar and gum are likely to prevent others from pretending to sleep when you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food is a regular crime in student colleges.
The theft of the whole chicken is, of course, a crime, but is the drop of milk in your tea stealing?
Double check it with the owner of the milk.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're in there.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more adults than my roommates who exchanged their milk as a means to wash the utensils to punish the thieves.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn't make noises that break people from sleep or study.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you're also famous people in glass houses.
The girl from my walk asked her neighbors if they could silence the drum and bass because there were 3 at night and she had a letter in the morning.
Their response was the strengthening of the music.
When they finally calmed down at 5:00 in the morning, she let them sleep quietly for two hours and then left her own music loud, locked the door and left for her three-hour letter.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future would go to the same college as you?
And on the contrary, wouldn't it be extremely embarrassing if you were mistaken for your future roommates, sleep together, break up and have to see each day and maybe take control of your friends?
Of course, you won't order hearts - but if your sex roommate is not your next step, at least try to talk to your weaknesses.
In an exciting moment when you realize that someone has left the keys in his unclosed room, there is only a thin border between laughter and ridicule.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Learn them a valuable and fun lesson about their security by hiding something from them - never destroy any room with a toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock them in the door and put their keys in the bottle with the water you pour into the freezer - but they will never stick their things to the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was happy for twins, and despite the incredible prospects for the future.
Eva's been through a crucifixion with the seven-year-old Vite.
His father broke up with her and she was alone for the preparation and education of her offspring.
With the situation, I was able to cope relatively quickly - I was very happy with the child and looked for a positive one.
Insecurity and being alone with the child, I tried not to bother myself.
And I certainly had the hope that we wouldn't stay alone for long, Eve remembers her first pregnancy today.
By then she had met on the Internet in the chat room of the elder Vask, with whom they had started to talk about favorite movies.
Vítka and Vítka even drove home from the womb, but they didn't have much to do with the role of their own father.
"For a while he got out of the program," Eva described in the documentary series Four in that 3.
The reason for the third series of Czech television is to look for luck for a second attempt.
The family’s care for Vítka and financial security was managed by work on part-time care and great assistance to the mother and aunt’s assistance.
Neither the prospect of responsibility for a foreign child at the end of Wasch’s affection for Eve.
They've definitely come together around Vitk's second birthday, and this one now understands Vashka as his father, and so does he.
Although Vasek already has two grown daughters, the father of 60 uses his words and also makes more use of his children.
In addition to Vitka, there was another two-year-old Leondy and finally a two-year-old.
"Yours into our family was so natural, perhaps because my mother never talked much to me," she thinks she's funny.
A little place?
At least we're close.
The twins Emma and Ela were born into the emperor’s line after Eve was diagnosed with pregnancy at the end of pregnancy.
This is a disturbance in the production and activity of biliary acids, which then occur in excess of the amount of blood pregnant and are particularly present in the consciousness.
Immorality is dangerous for an unborn child who is at risk of premature birth and death, most of whom are self-absorbed in mothers after birth.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Evin and Wasch, although they were only 36 weeks old.
Emichka was placed in an incubator in an intermediate department, where she also works in Vaskova's nest, which was able to take over and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger, and right after moving from JIP to room, I had her with me, describing a demanding period after Eva's birth.
In the womb, she spent twenty days before the doctors agreed to release a baby who, in the meantime, managed to reach a limit of two pounds.
Waiting for the children to be brought up in Eve’s womb did not bring joy.
"I've been mad at my husband and children," recalls a difficult moment in the division of a six-week four-week mother.
She also considered signing a reverse with her husband, among other things because of an insensitive approach by one of the doctors.
Eventually, however, it did not happen, and the doctors abandoned Eve and her twins to domestic care.
The events of four pregnancys and childbirths will broadcast ČT1 on Tuesday evening at 21:45 hours.
A whole number of families are capable of accommodating themselves.
They live together in a small house not far from Prague, where Eva had to cope with electric double-floor and tight conditions.
The house didn't grow, but Vasek made Eve happy by installing a gas cook to make food for six people more comfortable.
If it's hot, we'll take care of the cab.
Eva is convinced that children are especially interested in family recreation and a pleasant atmosphere, not in the size or size of the home.
For the time being, we've been doing a lot better than we've been waiting for.
Although the disorder is worse hidden in a small space and the cubing baby sometimes goes beyond us, at least we're all close to each other, she smiles at Eva, who can find a positive page on every situation.
The Wascian work as a lighting lamp in the film is not a guarantee of regular income.
That's why he sometimes goes to Prague streets as a taxi driver.
In his 60s, according to his words, care for family finances and children physically manages how long will it be?
"I realize that, given our age difference, it will be me once who will live this family," Eva admits on the balance when she asks for the future.
She would like to get back to work, but she prefers even more the possibility of her own business.
With four kids, I'm not at the moment for the employer.
And if it gets worse, we can talk to your husband about a cab, joke about a nice blonde.
Apple's got her effect.
For everything, the displays can do.
The most efficient processor, the larger resolution camera, the stronger chess or display recognizing touch force, are in the shortest advantage of the recent 9th generation iPhones.
The last two have also a negative impact on the size and weight of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
The usual trend in Apple was that every new generation of iPhones is easier than the previous one.
The exception was only a third and fourth generation whose weight slightly increased against the previous iPhones.
The two-gram mass of the difference in the failure of the news was, however, truly negligible.
However, new iPhones don't pay far.
In contrast to last year's iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, weight increased in a smaller model of 14 grams, in a larger one of 20 grams.
On one side you can't be surprised, the last affair with bending in Apple's pockets suffered a lot.
Shasi novelty is thus made of more solid lead stilts of 7000, which has also been shown to be material.
But they have a much bigger impact on her.
Apple used 3D Touch technology in the news, as the screens reveal the strength of touch.
To this end, it was necessary to monitor another level of capacity sensors.
The importance of new iPhone displays has increased more than twice over the previous generation.
For a smaller iPhone of initially 12 grams per 29 grams, in the case of more than 19 grams per 40 grams.
In iPhone 6s, the display is so difficult to use as a component.
The weight of only 143 grams was then also achieved in this news thanks to the evaporative skin that affected most of the remaining components.
In the larger model, then the most difficult component used is the battery, but its weight has not changed in any way against the predecessor.
Even in this case, the biggest growth is just the same as in the display.
Weight 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus thus reaches 192 grams.
How much new technology will be practical, it will appear when used.
The first users will be able to test it on Friday, 25 September, when the sale of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus will begin in the selected countries.
They've been on the champions' breakfast for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglici, archaeologists succeeded in finding an interesting possibility.
They found traces of the settlement of modern people from different times, including wall paintings, the rest of the tools and so on and so on.
In the 23A layer, which is dated to about 30 thousand years ago, scientists have discovered something that very much reminds the rest of the breakfast buffet.
On the spot, there were traces of oats, which are likely to have passed through the production process of so popular fibers today.
She's growing up today first, then she's dry, she's getting rid of the package, so she's a pulch, and then she's going to sleep and she's going out.
In the cave of Paglicci it was possible to discover seeds that were all burned or burned, and then apparently torn between two millstones - at least this suggests the rates of use on two rocks in the cave.
Scientists have thus failed in their publication for the magazine PNAS to prove that a complete process of production of fibers is in the cave, but the similarity is really very imaginary.
We also don't have any evidence of people's ability to eat meat, but the belief that it was with some liquid and perhaps even heat is, of course, quite logically offered.
At the same time, it is a very interesting evidence of how intensively people used crops long before agricultural production.
If the cell interpretation is correct, the oldest cells were carried out in agriculture for about twenty thousand years.
New report of stations in the Transport Company of Brno.
So once again I listened to the report of the name of the stalls in the trolleybus: Hnusáčkova, Přizakak, Frazova, Spratecká.
Of course, the trolleybus was a bit louder, so reporting by a male voice was somewhat less understandable than before when the stops were spoken by a female voice.
Women's voice is higher, so in deeper traffic noise, it's better discernible than a deeper male voice.
The DPMB argues that these voters have chosen their own passengers - I don't know who didn't ask me, but they have certainly chosen from the studio recordings made in total silence, which, of course, sounded quite different from that of the bus engine.
I've been living in Brno for a couple of decades, so the correct names of all these stops are known to remember, so I don't need this report, but the foreigners who don't recognize in Brno and for which these reports are intended above all, can be confused and can be at the end where they failed to understand, then claim that the stop they were supposed to come to was not reported at all.
Perhaps the choice of voters - but better again voters - should be made again, and this time colored with normal transport noise and engine calculation, in which the drumming of the reflector on the bus is almost lost.
In order not to continue to listen to the name of the water station Hershpice, Šmirova, or then Ponorna in the shrinking border, to which I moved in Komárova.
I suppose my old ears didn't get worse all of a sudden during the one day when the speaker changed the stop.
I understood the report quite well before that day.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the tape recorders.
Today, few people know what the greatest and most intelligent governments of the country were called complex checks.
I let myself remember that.
The bus was late.
I shot at the dispatch office at the moment when the radio sounded like it was seven hours ago.
"You're lucky you didn't fight with your partner, came a minute before you, and it doesn't seem to have a mood," the dispatcher noted, while I was writing in the book of incomes.
Thank you, I'll give it to you.
Write to me that I'm going to check out a little mechanization.
It's not gonna work out, it's checking today.
They're all out of shit until they're scared.
What's this about?
"But you'll see," the dispatcher shuddered.
You'll be next.
I ran out on a walk.
Then the chief's door opened and the chief appeared.
Stunned, with a stone face, in a perfectly falling corner.
"Good morning, Mr. Chief," I greeted him politely and quickly turned on two buttons of the same suit.
"Good morning," the answer sounded, and I quickly ran to the second floor without realizing the cold, vicious tone that the old one responded to.
"You're playing," I was greeted by the engineer Eva, the elderly lady I really appreciated.
She was even the chief before her companions sat down.
There's checks, and you're gonna get there.
How many times have I asked what these complex checks are, but nobody wants to talk about it.
They've been there once in three years, they all have to be there, and it's pretty unpleasant.
At least for some.
But I'll see.
I pulled out a file from the column with periodic reports and then the phone.
"This is Holcman, come to me now," the chief's voice called out.
What's the matter?
Now we've met and nothing..." I've missed, but no one has answered me, everyone with his thoughts.
"Good day, my fellow chief, I came to your order," I said, "I barely entered the mayor's office.
The chief was sitting behind a writing table and looking at some ladder.
"A fellow mechanic," he said after a moment without raising his head and still carefully looking at the file, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the leftover on the table, cleaned himself up into the chair, and looked straight at me with a normal, unpleasant, evil, puzzling look.
I've lost it.
What's going on?
Last night, he praised me for having worked very well in those few months and for being happy with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the corner at a distance.
And now this?
I realize that you're a wire distance technique, and that's why you have to behave.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is just unacceptable.
I hesitated to say that I used to say such a greeting from my childhood that I was so raised and that I didn't see anything wrong with it.
It was like a red hat on a croc.
"You're on a socialist railway and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of the job," said the commanding officer.
Besides, you're still messing with the superiors.
One time you'll say, "Sir," and then you'll say "conspiracy" again.
But I'm not a captain for you, but a fellow chief.
The mercenaries are co-workers, the top coaches are co-workers of the top coaches!
Remember that kindly!
I'm sorry, sir... I'm with the chief, but... but I've greeted you with the usual civil greetings.
There's nothing wrong with that... and it's an honor to work, or to a friend... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your advantage that you're not on the side," coldly said the chief, who in the meantime calmed down a bit.
But it's still going to be.
Anyway, remember that you don't have the chair on top of your pension.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something was not his advantage, it didn't look good with the guy in question.
For a while, he would give me a cold, a loathsome look, and I would look for the words that I would answer.
I'm also ashamed of his high-end printing.
He was only a few years older and he was playing the god, actually a fellow god.
It's a bit of an atrocious, self-inflicted, arrogant, as it was for him at the moment.
Everyone pulled him out.
Wake up, he's the chief.
Actually, not everyone, the president of the party organization, like all the parties, but also the non-partisan, tweeted.
But the chief squealed to many, especially to those who could apply his superiority.
Right now, he hit me for the whole shit.
I've been thinking about shit and I've had enough moves to keep me from shooting him in the face.
But I wouldn't even go back to the pumpkin, so I'd keep doing the train station.
What would I use two kids for?
And that's a set-up bar!
I was in trouble, but I was in control.
I'm not gonna make him happy.
"That's all, you can go," the head of the audience ended and began to look literally again at the ladder he had in his hand before.
In the mid-twelfth they called me.
Everyone in the office was there already asking questions about what and how, they said, yes, that it would be good.
Only Jojin was able to tell us what his habit was, that we could not all get out, because this work would have to be a partner of the chief with his own faithful, and that he would not be in danger.
The word "conspiracy" then stressed it as if he knew what the old man was up to me for this morning.
There's been a nice meeting in the principal's office.
The Association of Chiefs at their writing table and at the Long Advisory Table of Other Fellows, who were to decide on my office or not.
Kádrávák, President ROH, a writer from staff, a rapporteur for special purposes, something in a way that contradicts the war, and the place, my boss.
And also the most important person, the president of the party organization.
I knew him from the strike.
The usual track worker, he slammed the dust or he saw the cast iron.
But also a former baker.
It's been heard that there was no funny thing about him this time, like a nice beast.
The bad languages said he went out of school in the seventh grade, didn't learn anything, didn't laugh.
And when the criminal was canceled, he ended up at the top of the potatoes.
But, mate, that's right, mate was fucked!
The chief ordered me to sit down.
There was a little nipple in my neck, an insatiable scarf in my neck.
Kádrávák has read a review from the Civilian Committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working family, I'm married, two kids and so on and so on.
So far it's good, I've thought about it, and I've already had a little better breath.
Then we'll review the party's organization.
He copied the judgment from the civil committee, so that they both wrote the same person.
But then it came!
Parents of long-standing members of the parties refused to submit themselves before the inspection committee and subsequently came out of the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me very closely.
The chair noticed and stopped reading.
The chief said he should continue.
It was worse still.
I was a member of the SSM City Committee, and there I was acquired as a party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who came out of the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I married and married, except for the National Committee, I also had a church.
I failed the party's trust in the worst way possible.
That's why I was cut off from among her candidates.
But it didn't!
I let both children get baptized, and even my mother, when she died, made a church funeral, although it was a former member of the party.
I'm giving all of this a negative attitude towards the leading role of the party.
When the cadre was read, only the hammering of the chief's chest to the table was interrupted by a tight silence.
Everyone looked at me and I wished I was far away.
Then I kept repeating in my mind, "The Communists - the Overwhelmed, the Communists - the Overwhelmed." What did I get for that?
Why didn't I stay with the coffers?
I could've fixed the escape without a fucking check.
But now?
The career of the police officer took her place before she started.
Go back to the chair?
I don't think that's gonna work out, but I'm sure the chief will be out for an hour.
"Counsel, how did you check the discussed fellow here?" interrupted the quiet chief's question on the chair.
Well, according to an ex-employee's judgment.
Do you have him here?
The chair was obviously not overtime.
On the cuttings of the pot, he was nervously obliterating, as if he was being checked himself.
He snuck in and gave the chief some paper.
"Well," said the chief with a sign of greed, which was often the premonition of storms.
At first glance, the praise itself, taught with prominence, studied the industry, worked in the task mill as a locker, met the standard on an average of 20 percent.
But it's a big deal.
From where did you take the sentence, mate?" he turned back to the cadre who felt that it was beginning to turn against him in a way that he would soon not even have to be a cadre.
Here's where my partner gave it to me when she came in.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he came to us, he went to the corner of the hall," blocketed the cadre.
And there's no need for the sentences, which was kind of his extra, so I gave him the file.
"So, when you entered the technical function, you had enough of this paper," the chief said.
The chair was nervous and had no response.
"It's okay, we'll talk about it later," closed the matter to the chief and the cadron obviously fell off.
For the time being, it's settled.
"So what about you, mate?" the chief turned to me again.
I'm out of here all of a sudden, so it's over!
In my eyes, it's dark, it's hot.
He followed the course of trials and accusations, and I knew that I was the most reprehensible creature in the world who did not deserve the slightest pity.
That by undermining the incomplete judgment, I mentioned in the error of the Cadet rapporteur's companion, and I didn't understand why the judgment was incomplete when I got it from the Cadet at the factory.
I am also an antisocialist living that, in the time of building real socialism, supports the ranks of religious darkness, ba, even their participation.
That there was a lot of things I did, or maybe I'm still asleep, and I'm still praying for peace to end it.
I don't care.
I don't care if I fly out of the machine room.
I don't care if they take my potato too.
It's a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemies of the people I was in the eyes of the chief's friend.
"So it would be enough, comrade of the chief," the president of the party suddenly called and interrupted the chief of the Levites.
This is where the associate made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he just did the stupid thing!
But he has already received his punishment!
Don't forget that, my fellow chief!
What could be worse for a young man than if we shut the door to him for a while!
To open up again, he'll have to prove that he's changed that it's an hour of our trust.
An uneducated baker spoke as a book.
Where did it get into him?
Is that how he felt, or was he poking phrases from party schools and meetings?
That's why this young fellow must also get a chance from us!
The chance to prove he's changed.
And who's gonna give it to him if it's not you, Chief's friend?
It is your duty to support this young man, the truth, a bit of a beloved companion, in his efforts to correct him!
It's your page duty that no one's gonna let you go!
Actually, it's a site duty for all of us, too.
This is where a friend has to see that the party hasn't forgotten him.
That as a kind mother, not only does he punish, but he loves her too.
When the president's finished, no one even fainted.
No one's been waiting for that kind of turn of events.
At least me.
"Just as I agree with you, my colleague, the president," the chief tried to take the initiative again.
If you let me make a deal, you'd hear that I was heading to that conclusion.
All agreed, but it was on them to see that he didn't believe a word.
"So I was confirmed for the function of a self-certification referent on basic funds," I called back to the office and broke down.
Besides Evy engineers, they were all at lunch.
The silences listened to my inconsistency of fresh experiences, and I calmed down in the meantime.
When I was done, she asked me if I could have a cup of coffee.
Without waiting for the answer, she put water in the oven and caught some scissors.
In the meantime, she was discussing quadruple practices.
As one judgment, often full of praise, they give the person into their hands, and the other, in which is the dirt, will send the new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was, but at the end of the bumper, so the company didn't know where to send it.
What about our cadre?
He's just getting old where he'd eat or drink, and then finally he'd get the way he did.
"That's from the old secret," she said, "unfortunately.
He's definitely not gonna taste it today.
Look at him anyway, he's pretty guilty.
What about the party president?
Basically a much worse chief, no people.
Zero from a potato with a lot of power.
The water for the coffee started to boil and the office filled the smell of just fried coffee.
I put sugar in a cup of cake, and the lipstick mixed a hot potion.
I hope I'm out of the worst.
Now it's not going to work out for me, and the other checks are only in three years.
Anyway, my fellow chief's gonna just forget about me today.
Anthology of the LITERATIA ON TRATI II.
The symbol of the alien has survived.
The windmill circle over Chlum is spinning again after years.
It's seen far away because it's located at 15 meters high.
People from a wide area call him "the wind on the Chlum."
For the population of 150, it became even one of the elements of the general mark that the population gained the opportunity to meet the parents in 2010.
"We then asked for a sign and the wind on the sign of course we wanted to have, of course, everyone knows it," said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlumsian wind pump is a local technical memory.
It is also a bit of the present: it reminds us of the time when the present people fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum was rare in the past century.
By 1910, the hummingbirds were decided on solutions, which then lasted until the mid - 1980s.
In the village near the bay of Chichov, they let a seven - foot [7 m] deep well.
Three years later, they added a metal construction with a wind pump, which poured water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village near the right church.
"The construction has been carried out by Antonín Kunc of Hranic on Moravia with 2,400 crowns," notes the monumental inscription on the floor fence construction.
After several repairs and shocks of the wind cycle, it was due in 1971.
Then, on May 7, 1973, a new chapter of the water struggle began to be written: that day in Chlums began to serve a new pipeline.
The wind pump has already remained only a non-functional general symbol and this is a rarity.
The Dominant was welcomed at the birth this year.
By 2008, Chlumšti decided that the wind cycle would be restored and introduced again.
They left to produce a replica of the original wheel - reduced average of half a meter.
The wheel was mounted on the fence, but it had to be pulled down that same year.
The manufacturer of the replica did not select the suitable material and the wheel was not supposed to resist the wind currents.
Then the Chlumsian dominant rested for several years under the roof.
Since June, however, the wheel on the high yard has been running again.
On the occasion of the birth of the twins, the twins left the replica of the wheels to be adjusted and again seated on the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel is pumping out the drinking water from the barn to the perspiration of the blind shoulder.
And over the summer, we completely disconnected him because there was little water in the barn.
At least it was empty.
"In the afternoon, the windwheel from the pump in the bag we relax again," explained Mayor Mašek.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic where the wind cycle into the general sign, but is the only one of this species all over the Highland.
They have a similar element in the mark to honor local technical memory, such as in Chvalkovich and Green Mountain in Viškovsk, in Kuželová in Hodoninsk, Partutovich in Prerovsk or in Police in Vsetinsk.
Nothing wrong, but Lafata didn't know, she confessed to the resistance of Tripoli Goian.
"I remember the fight against Slavia very well, and my goal, like all in my career," the 34-year-old Goian smiled at the pre-supposed press conference.
This time George Hagi trained us, it was a shame we lost.
I hope I'm going to hit Sparta right now.
Just the difference that we don't lose this time," Goian continued.
This man, who had 60 matches for Romanian representation, is the key support of the Greek team.
As a stopover, he will face the attacks of the Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people come, no hell, says about the Greek battle, Captain Hybsh.
And he knows what he can expect on Thursday night.
I know Fataie, who played in Romania's Astre with my brother Lucian.
I saw all their fights back then.
I know he's a very good attacker, so he went to Sparta, too, said Goian.
The other footballers of the Prague club didn't mention, so the direct question came as to whether David Lafata, the best shooter in the history of the Czech League and Captain Sparta, knew.
Goian smiled, and with a light computational look he was looking at Czech journalists.
The ugly expression in the face was, "Why are you asking me this?"
A little while later, you let it down.
We saw some videos, and I noticed Sparta playing a lot of teams.
He's got really good players.
What about Lafata?
Nothing bad, but I don't know anyone but Fatia.
The expert on Goian knows very well.
"My experience from larger clubs, it can be said that they hold the defense of Asteras, it's their game organizer," noted Spartan assistant Stanislav Hajkal.
Goian's got the best years of his life, but he can boast of a very interesting football biography.
In time, Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, was interested in him, both the United and City Manchester, but Steauy headed for the Italian Palermo, also playing for Glasgow Rangers.
We're waiting for an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a great team, regularly playing European Cups, betting on the victory in the Czech League.
For me, this is a favorite game, but we're playing at home and we want to start the group with good results.
Like Sparta, we'll try to win, Goian said.
I'm in peace with the Slovenian barrister Tomáš Košický, who is very excited about the Czech rival.
Me, too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new seat should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trading with shares of the company at the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have a group seat in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken for the time being in the project are mostly legal and administrative and have no real impact on the company, says Daniel Burys, the financial director of the Kofola Group.
"In relation to the move of the group's seat, the shareholders consider placing the shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to the accession to the Prague Stock Exchange, the company completes the prospectus of the paper, which will be submitted to the Czech National Bank for approval as soon as possible.
The movement of holding positions and related transfers of shares will be carried out in the form of a public transaction by involving only existing shareholders.
In the context of this operation, therefore, no public registration or new investors will be offered.
"A possible offer of shares to new investors would be made - the company will withdraw and its shareholders will decide - later, either in the 4th quarter of 2015 or in the 1st quarter of 2016," the company said.
The company has already stated in the past that any offer of shares could consist of the issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on a stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the placement of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Test of objectivity of Czech television in information about the migrant crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of the reports of the main Czech media on the refugee crisis.
This time, the main news broadcast of Czech television.
And how did she survive?
When journalists at the Faculty of Journalism learn about how the media can manipulate reality, they can release today's Czech TV Event.
The migration crisis has been devoted to about 80% of reporting.
Until the first minute, when CT informed of the concerns on the Serbian-Dutch border and the attacks of migrants on the police, she called them euphemistically patience - threw stones and attacked with metal fists), she already ate today's migrant propaganda - see for herself the names of individual reports.
Criticism of non-governmental organisations - a large space for non-profit organisations that criticise the poor treatment of migrants.
Syrian children in Czech School - story of the integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
It's not just a threat, it's a chance.
Travel of refugees - CT consistently uses terms of runner or fugitive and not migrants.
Infectiously, CT uses only pictures for small children and women in illustrative recordings.
In the same broadcast, she said that 80% of migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: Most of the propaganda that does not have a period of communist agitants.
I have to say that I'm ashamed of my colleagues as a former journalist.
Ecology in practice.
When I first got into a panel apartment, I was soon to stop being the only resident.
I've been moved to a boarding school by fishermen.
Fish domestic, wet with change incomplete, i.e., non-performing it transfer from the mussel to the brooch and the young look like an adult, it's just tiny and gradually growing.
They were disgusting to me, and I didn't want to lose them.
First hand and later chemical.
Socialist drugs on their disposal provided some blue crystals.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or something else?
But it was successfully eliminated.
Later, I decided to do the same with the Pharaoh.
A box with some juvenaliser that the ants brought into the nest and then he did not allow the queen to produce a new offspring.
But I refused.
As time went by, he also became a wet subject of my audience, and I became increasingly attached to the view that they have the same right to life as we do.
In addition, I've learned from my life that interference with the ecosystem does not lead to success and one damage can replace another.
The truth about the blokes and the puppyes, I'd probably not be able to make it worse by killing them.
In the new residence, we agreed with our partner that if we don't have the fish lying behind our neck, let the wolfs eat the lost skin, some of the invisible breeds, and so forth.
Their peaceful existence has been disrupted by spiders.
It was a common kind of walker who had been sitting on the roof for a long time.
We thought he was living with occasional males and mosquitoes, which only made us feel comfortable.
Because he lived with us for several years, we found out that he was living mainly with fishermen and that he was probably keeping their numbers in a profitable number of states.
With reliable regular contact, we have found that she is a female when needed.
We were witnesses of romantic offenses with a partner about a third less than a third, how careful he is on the spider's fibers, so he can not be eaten before he reaches the extracted dome.
It took about three days for them not to move and not to respond to our controls.
Under the toilet, where the loving toys were played, we later found the remains of the dried female by the females.
Then the spider didn't move for weeks.
When we thought it was already behind us, we were surprised by the number of little spiders hanging around her.
They're gone soon.
For the sake of their mother they were consumed, for the sake of others.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
If she left or fell asleep, we don't know, but after a month, two, she showed up on the roof again.
The truth is, about something smaller, probably the daughter of those toilet cooks.
For some time, she carefully observed our behavior and, by moving under the toilet, assessed our non-attack as a friendship.
The numbering status of fishers was reduced again, and spiders looked at their usual activities in order to ensure food.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed all year round.
Our daughter grew up to that age when using the nightstand was a shame.
We've tolerated it so far, but we've already been fed by the eternal draining of its contents.
We urged her to use the toilet even more.
However, the daughter found an excuse in the spider that she saw very well when she was driving.
Our talk about the spider seeing, the luck in the house didn't even take away.
With tears and tears, she made her nightfall.
There wasn't any leftovers.
There was a time when a spider had to be remarried in the interest of the daughter's developmental movement.
It was on me.
He was taken to a glass and shown across the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I was messing with him as a friend, but after as long a time as I was, I felt terrible as if I were throwing away my relative.
We assumed that fishermen would start to appear more often and would start to multiply by a geometric order.
The world's weird, the week, the two, no one showed up.
I started speculating about the reason.
It seemed to me that if the spider didn't grow up there in the pattern of ants, it wasn't as favourable to the environment of the toilet as we thought it would be.
But then the first pieces of the middle size appeared, and they moved again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I found that their bond to spiders had to have reason to believe that if they didn't see him, that he was hidden somewhere else and that they were in danger from anywhere.
Or, perhaps they had some telepathic connection with their predator and his rapid disappearance caused a terrible reaction.
You're saying that I'm not making any illusions about their appearance.
They showed some kind of a flashlight, but that they would react to hand-driving or quick movement, no.
The daughter goes to the bathroom all the time.
I think she's forgotten about the night.
There's only one spider left.
I'm sending my wishes to the ether, and I hope they didn't attack me after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use the B-cycle.
The fate of Albert Einstein, who enriched the world.
The years of a genius scientist of the past century are likely to never cease to fascinate mankind.
He managed to sink into everything so deep that the eruption was always an amazing discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
In the minds of the people, his special and general theory of relativity, which has so far been best described by the universe in its gigantic state.
It is also not possible to mention its explanation of the photoeffect or the idea of quantifiing the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the very description and system of knowledge popular theory of relativity is so much intertwined that for a closer acquaintance, they prefer easy arrangements.
It's not easy, though.
However, it would not be Albert Einstein if he did not find this in a brilliantly simplified form of explanation: an hour close to your lover seems to be a minute; a minute in a hot oven seems to be an hour - and that is relative.
I've been allowed to choose from his entire sheet of famous quotes the ten that have literally taken hold of me.
Smart people are trying to solve problems, brilliantly trying not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
Space and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about that first one.
No amount of trials can ever prove that I was right.
But the only thing that can prove I was wrong at any time.
But it's a sad period when it's easier to break up atoms than to destroy predestinations.
If the mess on the table reflects the mess in mind, what then reflects the empty table?
I don't know what's going to be fought in World War Three, but in that fourth, it's gonna be clacks and rocks.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but none to resurrect it.
Knowing a little is dangerous and knowing a lot too.
If I had an hour to deal with the problem that would depend on my life, I'd spend 40 minutes of his study, 15 minutes of his analysis and 5 minutes of his solution.
In the world the hardest thing to understand income tax.
Finally, I cannot forgive not to introduce Einstein's formula to the definition of success: If we take A for success, the pattern applies: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y rest and Z is to hold the language for the teeth.
New and modern.
The hospitals in Zlinsk are waiting for 1.5 billion changes.
"It is a success when we consider that all four are kept in black numbers all this year," hehtman Stanislav Mišák said.
At this point, the total profit of the country's facilities is about 32 million crowns.
The share is mainly higher than insurance premiums, which are equally favourable for this year.
And this fact shows that after poor years hospitals can finally allow more investment.
In Kroměříží, Vsetín, Uherský Gradště and Zlíní, this is why it is intended to build buildings that will total nearly 1.5 billion crowns.
The long time we bought the main equipment ended.
Now we need to start building new buildings, because without them, no peak health can be done, the plans of the country's place for the health of Lubomir Nezem.
He's looking forward to the changes in all the hospitals.
Construction workers are coming to the hospital next year.
In the Ossetia, the suppliers of the new internal pavilion are now selecting nearly 300 million crowns.
They have a planned dialysis port in Kroméríž.
This year, Uherska Hradškje wants to introduce a new internal to the opened central pavilion of about 200 million.
And the Zlinska Báča hospital is waiting for a long-awaited construction of a new central income and internal, which will need three quarters of billion.
In all cases, it is a fundamental and often biggest change in recent years.
"For the whole region, patients and doctors, this is an extremely important step," said for example, for example, the construction of the Svetin Internal Director of the Věra Prouskova Hospital.
Five-foot building should be ready in about two years and offers comfortable equipment for internal and neurological, dialysis, new ambulances, bed and intensive care.
More comfort for patients.
Changes, which are particularly familiar to patients, will affect all regions.
For example, new buildings will replace those in which many sick people are located in one room, on the floor they need only one toilet, beds are inconvenient, windows are uncomfortable, and doctors do not have adequate working conditions.
"For example, our interior was built 15 years ago and is now at the edge of its life," said the director of Pavel Calábek's home hospital.
Within a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-storey modern building linked to an emergency income.
Doctors and patients will have all emergency wards in one place, as well as in new spaces.
The same model already has half of the Uher Gardens ready.
The central revenue is already standing, and within three years it will be internal.
"We will pay for the construction from the loan and partly from our own resources," explained Director Petr Słádek.
This hospital can afford its own funding as the only one in the country.
The profit is still high, and it did not reach a loss two years ago, when the hospital had to deal with nearly two-and-a-half million losses.
"We have good insurance contracts, excellent performance, revenue and cost management across the hospital," Vlastimil Vajdák, who has an economy of concern, said.
Improvements are also expected in patients in the coronary hospital.
Over the next ten to fifteen years, it's going to go to repair, new devices and reconstructions up to half a billion crowns.
By this year, it will be ready to repair the capture station and then start the dialysis port, possibly building the building for a new magnetic resonance.

No one told me how I should keep my adopted refugees in the country if they don't want to live in the Czech Republic.
Minister of Interior Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) complains after dealing with his European colleagues that the other Member States of the Czech Republic are pushing to accept quotas for the redeployment of refugees but refuse any discussion.
It also suggests that no one has yet explained to him how to keep assigned refugees in the Czech Republic if they do not want to live with us.
"We didn't get the answer, and that's why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specifically the position that you have reached in the process of dealing with ministers inside and outside the European Union?
We don't agree with mandatory quotas like a system that just can't work.
We can't talk about migrants like salt or flour.
They're living beings who have some vision, some direction, some relative.
We wanted to hear from colleagues how we could keep migrants in the territory of the Member States if they were redistribution.
We can't imagine.
We didn't get the answer, and that's why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, that is, registration sites, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with this.
We've been talking about this for a year and we've been saying this is the way.
But to say that the quotas will solve everything?
We solved forty thousand recently, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep those people in this area?
Ninety-eight percent of all the people who pass through us want to go to Germany.
We don't want anyone here, we just don't know how to keep them here.
We have ambitions to go to other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as a target country, get us asylum, but the interest of people from this migratory wave, that is, Syria and other countries, is only near zero.
You mentioned that refugees don't even want to come to us, but fifteen people have already made a commitment.
Wouldn't it be possible to accept them this way more?
We made a commitment to accept 1500 people, but on condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operations.
Even in the 1500s, there's going to be 1100 people we're dealing with.
They'll come to our detention facility and we'll treat them the same way we've caught them.
It is a big question, and we will discuss it with Europe if we can hold back people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, where appropriate in Hungary.
Because Europe is acting in such a way that if they have registration, they cannot be detained.
This means that they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement that is not yet there, it may happen that we will not stay in the territory of the Czech Republic until 1100 and they will leave Germany again after their arrival.
If we are able to hold them under asylum proceedings, we will arrange an asylum procedure with them.
If citizens of Syria, Eritrea, almost 98 per cent of European statistics claim international protection.
Then they get the evidence that will allow them to travel across Europe.
And I think these people will end up in target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will move.
This is the second project that has been taking place so far, and there we have only advanced in that we are discussing with the churches the possibility that they could help them find employment, housing and so on.
But it's a very long race.
You said the other states weren't willing to discuss with us at the ministerial meeting.
But is it not that the Czech Republic only rejects quotas, but does it offer no solidarity step that would block the debate?
And what exactly do you think this is going to be?
If the Spolk Republic of Germany urges all migrants from Syria to be able to do so, the report will be circulated in an hourly manner throughout all camps throughout Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It's another migration wave that's heading to Germany because they just don't want us to.
We believe that the road is to protect the external borders - simply to rework the migration waves, to help the necessary ones, and to separate the economic migrants.
It's obvious to them that they don't have a chance.
Only a year ago, tens of thousands of Kosovos arrived in Germany.
From secure Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of this state, including police, courts, state representations.
If we managed to separate them and do not accept them or accept them only as economic needs, then the 50 percent of what social systems are spending on them today could go to refugees.
In contrast, on the first day that Germany took control, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's eighty, the first day it was twelve.
Where does it come from to further strengthen border controls?
We were afraid of arrest in the order of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have several hundred free seats in stone arrest facilities.
Of course, all the people we're going to hold will be returning to Austria within seven days.
We're doing it by default.
They're the only people who take us, it's complicated with Hungary and the Greeks - it's a completely unnecessary story.
So where's the point of a break?
Should it be a thousand a day?
I think it's supposed to be a couple hundred days a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two, three days a day, we're exhausted by capacity, so that crisis plans come in.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would call the extraordinary government immediately.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're on the phone several times a day.
If this situation arises, the government may sit down de facto immediately and decide by a resolution to strengthen the police force on the army, let's give this customs administration, if any, on the prison service.
The country variant is an exceptional state that has now been declared in some places by Hungary?
I don't think it can come this far from us.
Be aware that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have only a Schengen border and only at the airport.
I don't know what should happen in order for this to happen in the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread horrific information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, is more likely to suggest that the Hungarians will try to remove the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then be the direct route to Austria.
The Czech Republic would have touched it very much, almost at all.
Slavia has paid a lot of debts for the last minute.
It's trying to prevent a declaration of failure.
Soccer Slavia paid off debts.
The footballers were also waiting for their money.
Soccer Slavia stayed on Tuesday for the first time due to insolvency proceedings before the court.
Almost three months after about 20 million crowns made a proposal for Online Services from Pacific Samoa.
The legal representative of Slavia Zuzana Mládková tried to convince Judge Michael Wenzlov for a few hours that he was not going to report a fall on Slavia.
And it has to be said that she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week the new owner of Slavia became a large Chinese industrial and investment group of CEFC and also the Czech billionaire Jiří Šimana.
Apparently, from the new owners to the club, they've come up with money for the last minute.
This also proves the statement of the Hall before Tuesday's trial - the top club on Monday, only the day before the trial, sent tens of millions of crowns.
"Everything was awarded between September 11th and September 15th," the legal representative of Slavia Mládková said.
To whom did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
For example, the Slovenian former representative Milan Ivan or the Czech deputy Mari Lick.
Slavia also paid agent Alexandr Losenicke a fee.
On Friday, the club also paid debt fees to Prague 10.
Part of the insolvency dispute thus remains de facto only claims that Slavia disputes.
According to the club, the commitments were not at all raised, or they were dealt with in court.
However, we are prepared to pay for the loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds on the bank account, which we can provide with a statement from the account," the lawyer Mládková told the judge.
"All that was due is paid," Mádková declared and added that the undeserved are only unpaid or disbursed commitments.
It is also true that the judge will not decide in the next few days and that the trial will continue.
She gave Slavii three weeks to send detailed evidence that she really paid the debt.
Next comes the evaluation of all the evidence.
The decision can therefore be expected first in November.
The judge ordered the continuation of proceedings on November 3rd.
The decision, however, will not come to this meeting, but in writing after it.

FastMig X is the latest generation of inverter coatings.
The combination of peak technologies, hardware and software equipment integrated into the modular design brings benefits and rapid return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final composition is always configured according to customer requirements.
And anything, from the heating of the construction steel after the heating of the special slicing, as well as from the heating of the rough materials after the heating of the thin plates, from the application in the workshops to the heating of the refrigerators.
The incredible amount of shrinking curves, simple adjustment and expansion of the shrinking source enables a rapid response to change requirements, leading to a reduction of the simples, to the need for a change in the source and to more productive heating.
FastMig X enables the heating of peak heating processes developed by Kemppi, which ensure higher productivity and heating quality.
He stops wasting his time and does not allow material swallowing or repairing wrong weights.
It is provided with flexibility, is less simple, more heating and higher profit.
It's this year's news that she had a premiere in Nitra where she also got a gold medal.
We appreciate this approach because it confirms the product's exceptionalness.
The front world manufacturers can boast similar systems, but thanks to the differences in software and in the control of parameters, FastMig X belongs to the world point.
For stakeholders, the additional periods are certainly pleasant and are moving for about three weeks.
In the Czech Republic, we have already linked the first contacts that will certainly continue to expand after the Brno Fair.
We have been his regular participants for over 20 years, and almost always our business results are better than before, he highlights the company ARC-H Miroslav Streichsbier, the leading salesman of Kemppi in Plzni.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final composition is always configured according to customer requirements.
The blank was built to keep her from falling apart.
But it would be half a billion more, says an expert from the company who designed the tunnel.
The blank was even safer, says the expert.
The Blanka tunnel complex was possible to build so as not to cause two land failures in Prague's Stromovce, the factory director of Satra, who is the main projector of the tunnel, Alexandr Butovic.
He said it on Wednesday afternoon at a news tour of the tunnel.
But according to him, it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
The drivers will open on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel was going to blow up safer, but the costs are rising exponentially," said Butovic.
The conditions in Stromovce were the same throughout the period, although the country was only a few steps away from where it began to develop a safer and more careful method.
"If these measures were used 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion years older," Butovic said.
Blank's tunnel went down three times during the building.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovce, in 2010 the land fell to the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostav Jiří Bělohlav, the tunnel is too expensive, Euro said the week.
According to the original intention, the building had 17 billion crowns.
When we add the VAT that jumped twice during the construction period, you have eleven billion.
When technology, land purchases and engineering activities, valuations and similar items are involved, it is 29 billion, which is not from 37 again so far, Bélohlav said.
That's what someone ordered and paid for it.
iOS 9: How to get a new iPhone operating system with a new Apple update
The new operating system can be requested in Settings by clicking on the "General" tab and selecting "Software Update" (Update Software).
When it's ready, your phone will offer you the possibility to download and then install it.
Some users have encountered the problem after installation, specifically the error sound "upgrading the software failed".
One of the solutions to this problem is to wait until it gets interested in updating, or try it over iTunes.
The phone will provide you with an update process.
And this includes the need to uninstall the application to release the site - but it will not be necessary because Apple has reduced the update and also facilitated the entire process by using a special tool that the user will propose the application to remove and reinstall after the update.
Make sure your phone is busy before you start updating.
If the battery is low, Apple will not allow updating because interrupting the process may cause the update error.
Further reports: iOS 9 issue has not been postponed, despite the delay of WatchOS; iOS 9 review: exciting updating the new version of the operating system; iOS9: how to prepare for the release of the new iPhone operating system
Make sure that you have passed our list of things to do before updating, try and prevent or protect them. iOS 9 is a new feature, including even smarter personal assistants and a large scale of face-to-face features for iPad, as well as a lot of cost to speed up and repair the operating system.
Zisky FedExu mixed, reducing fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx has reported unsatisfied results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in forecasts of annual profits due to low demand for freight and higher costs for the land division.
The company also stated that it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
During this period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers on holiday.
The company's share decreased by about 2.5 percent in pre-market trade 45 minutes before the middle opening.
FedEx says it expects a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 for fiscal year, which ends next May, which means a 20 cent reduction from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey carried out by FactSet.
The reduced view is despite an increase in interest rates of 4,9 per cent on average, which appears in January. 4, and higher supplements for the land transport of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company stated that it is still expected to increase profit against the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
The chairman of the board and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "prepared a firm performance despite the expected economic conditions, especially in the processing industry and global trade."
The holiday rental plans were announced on the day after the rival UPS stated that it has to hire 90,000 to 95,000 employees in addition, which is probably the same as last year's hire.
In the quarter that ended in August. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
The profit for the action was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 for the action, which was predicted by 12 analysts questioned Zacks Investment Research.
Markets increased by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts from Zacks were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decrease in priority international shipping, which has led to revenue stagnating in its Express unit.
But boom in online shopping increased the results of the FedEx Earth Units.
In the last quarter, land income increased by 29 per cent, but operating profit was essentially the same for higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher income due to higher basic rates, while profits decreased in the freight trade due to higher labour prices.
In pre-trade, about an hour before opening, FedEx's share decreased by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a decrease of 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent under a record of 11 June.
At its most unexpected meeting over the years, the Federal Reserve Actor spends two days this week at 27 feet of the long Hungarian mahogany table and will decide whether after almost ten years the time has come to increase the key interest rate.
As far as they are concerned at one end of the central bank's ornamentation, the two-storey sitting room will be a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that President Fed Janet L. Yelle and her colleagues are going to give the economic interests of the people over everything else.
The Central Bank has a double charge from Congress: maximizing American employment and maintaining this price stability.
But since the Great Depression, the Feds have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third functional period: financial stability.
And this third functional period could be an X-factor too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday, whether the American economy is ready to set aside from unprecedented incentives in the form of almost zero short-term interest rates on the spot since the end of 2008.
Although most data show strong economic growth, recent turbulence on world financial markets could already scare the cautious Fed by adding to the gap by increasing its reference rate of federal funds - and nothing more than a quarter of a percentage.
"It is clear that the labour and inflation market will be the first most important thing to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, the main economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think that they were just looking for an excuse to not raise the level, increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient reasons to wait forward," she said.
There is no consensus on what Fed will do, which is the cause of anxiety on the financial markets.
About half of the economists recently questioned by Blomberg predicted an increase in the rate this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to hold back, with the key indicator only about 30% chance of increase.
This would indicate a decline in the stock market in the event that the Fed increases the rates, only if the policy is gradually failing by pledge that the further increase is inconceivable.
On Tuesday's industrial average, Dow Jones jumped by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599.85.
The meeting was triggered by the expectation that the Fed policy will keep the rates calm this week, says John Lonski, the main economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed had now raised the rates," he said.
If the Fed politicians did that, "they would have to go to the limit in their programme statement and hold the financial markets behind their hands so that they don't panic."
Other experts claimed that the increase in rates would calm down the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would act.
Only a month ago it seemed that Fed was on a good path to an increase of 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in the slow strengthening of the monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of economic recovery in the United States.
Yellen said that over the spring and early years, it is expected to increase the rates this year, even through complaints from the Liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the labour market this year saw strong growth.
The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.1% in the previous month, which is lower in more than seven years and is close to the level that Fed considers to be full employment.
The rental profits showed signs of rise.
And even though inflation continues to run under the annual 2% target of the central bank, Fed says that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can be balanced with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets all over the world began to decline at the end of last month, after China was wasting its money.
The industrial average of Dow Jones dropped by 16% under its record value in May when investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy would slow down global growth.
The market was somewhat reflected this month, and Dow is now losing only about 10% of the maximum of May.
To the political actors of the Fed, the restless situation on the market adds a complex calculation when it starts to increase the interest rate.
"In the absence of what has happened in the financial markets and reports on the weaknesses of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a reinforcement at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, head of UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
Now, he predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what impact this will have on the US economy, and there are almost no data to rely on about the latest development in China," Oliner said.
The health status of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so it should not be technically included in their decision-making.
But in fact, Fed has become the currency authority of the whole world.
The impact of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The clear sign of the then president Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "taste" their monetary expansion on the market, triggered the leaps all over the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interlinked, it can be expected that representatives of the Fed are monitoring developments elsewhere, but also dealing with other central bankers and experts so that they can better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the Global Strategy for Wealth Management of Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., noted this month that "Fed has a history of overruns in financial markets that seem unrelated to economic foundations."
Lacer, a member of the Federal Open Markets Committee's policy-making member who pressed for an increase in interest rates, cited the decision in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its reference rate by 0.75 percentage points during the three sessions "I through limited identifiable effects on growth in the USA," Lacker said.
About a year later, Fed's representatives turned these scars.
The Fed should give priority to concerns about financial stability only during the great crisis, such as the market collapse in 2008, said Adam Posen S., an former member of the Bank of England's stakeholder committee.
The most recent outbreak is not even approaching this level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of growing interest, because markets have collapsed," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for the International Economy.
The Federal Reserve System Act has two more mandates and does not mention financial stability, and until it changes, I don't think they should get to the point.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinese Quarter
The market/store was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells for the public.
Yes, it's a Chinese quarter, not a Thai quarter.
The market/store is the only contact place that offers an amazing range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian decorations, and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
Even car parts are available if you need some motor oil.
Trade is massive, and it'll take you an hour to get through all the streets.
If you have any of this buying hunger, go to the food at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal trading station (good, cheap) is close to registers and has different pick-up locations.
What on stock: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
The items are affordable and many items are sold in large sizes.
Among fresh products are special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruit and other.
Mass enlargement is great, for example, fish - employees behind your desk wash and exhale, even sweeten it, if you want it,
The good part of the shop is left to a massive freezing section where you will find frozen crayons of leaves, bitter melon and gallantal, whole ducks, fish, beef and veal, pork beans, fish balls, regional sausages, free-sale semi-trailers and others.
Who buys here: Restaurant owners and chefs, also single families and individuals.
The broad streets come up with shopping vehicles and high-level vehicles.
Find: Fresh monthong durian next to the treasure stand.
Where it is located: Trade is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounded by the suburbs of the Chinese quarter and center - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking space, which shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store may be busy, parking is usually not difficult to find.
The speed on the streets will stay with the old man.
The acceleration to 150 km/h has been refused.
The selected sections will not be possible to increase the maximum permitted speed by 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
On Tuesday, Sniemovna decided when she came to the amendment proposal of the Senate, which refused to increase the speed.
The new land communications law will now turn to the president.
At the end of April, President Milos Zeman said that the law would veto the speed of a foot-and-mouth disease.
Against the increase, the Minister of Transport Dan Çok (for the UN), according to which the Czech road network has not yet been built at such a speed.
He supported the Senate version of the law on Tuesday before the MP.
The approved new ones will now be able, in accordance with the original government proposal, to increase the speed from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first-class roads, in particular four-way routes.
The House first extended this option to the roads, which could be driven at the chosen speeds up to 150 km/h, but the Senate refused.
The envoys have now joined in on his proposal.
The senators, with the consent of the Minister of Transport, also requested that the transport police be authorized to have the last word when editing local communications that the local authorities are taking care of.
The Senate version approved by Szymovna is also calculated to allow the sewerage, watercourses or public lighting cables to be stored separately below the surface of the wagon.
That's how the aliens would save the land.
The municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads regardless of the owner of the relevant land.
Novela is also intended to help improve the protection of the roads and to facilitate the loading of remote vehicles by the municipalities to which the owner is not reporting.
New municipalities could sell detachable vehicles that do not appear within a six-month period following notification of the detachment of their owners.
The municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight transport across their territories by the roads of the second and third classes under the threat of torture and for shipping companies.
Novela is also disrupting the possibility of introducing electronic road signs instead of today's papers, which will be used even after 1 January next year.
According to the government, it will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The oral expressioner goes before the court.
For the predestined welcome of the nuns, he's been in danger for 10 years.
The case relates to the allegedly pre-inhabited welcome project.
The police wanted to come to this case and the Ambassador Zuzan Kailov (CSSSD), the Ambassador of the House, but did not release it.
According to the legal qualifications of the case, both are at risk for up to ten years.
The main count is already planned for two October days.
According to state representative Mandík and Macík, at least one million crowns have been damaged, resulting from the complaint.
The complaint is based on a search warrant.
The former members of the city’s management, according to the complainant, wrongly allowed the property of the company which organised the welcome of the citizens.
Mandík, said he had complained to the then head of the City Services, Education and Culture Board, to address five affiliated companies in the selection process.
When another company, which offered the lowest price, applied to the competition, the board canceled the competition.
The contract was then to entrust the city to the administrator, and only Darothore was registered to the competition, which was then awarded by the city council.
The city paid at least a million extra.
Both charges were directed to ensure for Darothore the award of a public contract for the organisation of a welcome event in Ústí nad Labe in the long term and coordinated at least against the requirement to treat the proper economy, writes state representative.
At the same time, he was aware that Darothore subsequently, after obtaining this contract, Ústí nad Labam is counting on the implementation of the welcome of the award ceremony, which will, in contrast to the real value of the services actually provided, be slightly elevated.
In three years, the company entered more than five million crowns in the project, according to the paper.
The city eventually paid only one share, about 1.7 million crowns, and then it stepped away from the contract.
The amount paid was estimated to have been at least one million crowns pre-favoured.
Mandik's already refused any violation of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this built-in case, the former prime minister said before that the city under his control had just linked to a similar project from previous years.
From 2008 to 2010 the event was provided by Roxy II.
"It was under the same conditions, the same money," Mandík added.
The criminals wanted to accuse also Ambassador Kailov, who was also a member of the city council.
But she didn't give it to the police.
Criminals have, therefore, put the case to a standstill, but they count on Kai's accusation after the deputy's mandate is over.
The welcome of the nuns was a social action that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift check for 5,000 crowns for the purchase of children's needs and small gifts.
The Hungarian policemen reportedly left behind a dog.
Then the reporters were forced to delete the record.
The Hungarian police were on the border with Serbia in a short time held by the AP cameraman and forced him to delete the record that the police dog reportedly hit the refugee country.
The Hungarian government is questioning this charge.
The alleged incident took place on Saturday night, when the cameraman AP Luca Muzi filmed migrants who across the cornfield near the Hungarian city of Röszke crossed the border with Serbia.
Against the refugees, the police marched, and one of them let an Syrian attack a dog with a basket on its jaw.
The dog of a man who screamed, "Please, please, I'm a fugitive," said Muzi.
The fact that Muzi is filming everything, he noticed one of the cops and he wouldn't let him leave.
Then the reporter shouldn't have called his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
The Muzi police took him to a dark spot at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had been fed.
Then he was ordered to delete the record.
Muzi thus lost the result of two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt at risk because they were close to dogs.
The AP sent a protest letter to the Hungarian government spokesperson Zoltán Kovács.
The conduct of the police in it has made it unacceptable and stated that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not afraid that the government will destroy the lawfully obtained material.
The man with a call to the museum's police report questioned the events.
He said the police just wanted a reporter to show them if they were on some footage they were entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't push him.
"The dogs can bite - they're trained to scare off and push a bit of fear, but they certainly didn't attack," Kovács says.
Unpredictable League of Masters.
Victory to the City will push us, believes Juventus
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we deserve to lose," cut the head of Manuel Pellegrini, a housekeeper in the city.
We had more chances and played better than Juventus.
It was a classic game of the League of Masters.
Not one team has created a lot of opportunities, but we had a ball on the sidewalks for a while.
"The cause of the defeat was not in tactics, Juventus just shot two beautiful goals," assessed the Pellegrini game, whose team was incassing in a competition game after 636 minutes.
The finalist of the last Juventus season at that time was exactly the opposite - after the first three rounds of the Italian league there is only one point in the title and score 2:4 is up to the 16th place of the table.
And that's why the turn to Etihad Stadium was a great surprise.
"This victory will help us psychologically, it will get us," believes Coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three resistances before the new year - Pirla, Tévez and Vidal.
In Manchester, they represented Pogba, Manjukic and Morata.
"That's right, this victory is very important, so that we can find it on the winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're among the best men in Europe.
In the second half, we were better, especially in the attack phase.
This result is what my players deserve.
"Before our balancing goal, we could have incassed at 0:2, but Gianlugi supported us," praised Allegri Golman Buffon.
"We've burned several good chances," hated Yay Touro, Deputy City.
We need to get out of the League of Experience Masters and try a better outcome next time.
Good-bye, Angelo. Good-bye, old Germany II.
Before we continue to raise the question of immigrants, we should realize that the whole media shake around is managed by professionals.
According to the need of the media and also of the sesher.
So let's stop for a while.
Today, the newspapers and the media are full of children who carry on their parents ’ hands on dusty roads of the exodus.
And that calls for a person - that is, a European person - to automatically feel guilt and compassion.
Well, they don't come here just desperate children, notice on the pictures of the docking boats to the Greek islands, that the baby isn't so visible on them!
Well, we've been missing from the TV lately the pictures of ships heading on Lampedus, refugees from the French border at Menton, whose beautiful walks include thousands of young men.
Most of the young blacks.
And they also disappeared images from Callais, where these people are eating and black men are waiting for them to go through the tunnel under La Manche.
I don't think it's gonna work anymore.
Nor did the pictures of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans make the people of Europe feel special.
It was too much of a fake.
So when it comes to refugee quotas, it's kind of a secret that it's not only about unhappy children from Syria, but also about the stables - for older people: fashionably decorated - young men.
Their muscles look like they just got out of a fitness center.
It's just one personal experience.
This summer we stayed on the private beach of the hotel on the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus.
No matter how private she was, a large group of cars suddenly arrived at the beach.
But no ham.
And young blacks came out of them.
About thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They went to the beach, all dressed in brand clothes and boots, in the hands of, like, smartphones.
That it was a private beach, it was not interesting and the employees - Turks, Muslims! - they were obviously afraid of them.
They planted all the beds.
Whoever didn't lie on it and was just in the sea had a bad heart.
They were dressed like from an American rapper movie.
On the head of the hat with the fingernail, white and colorful adidas on the legs.
And then they took the local beach bar and started to breed.
They sat around the chairs, sat next to the breakfast and white guests of the bar - read to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
The mothers and the children went from the dining room to a place of rest.
The next black people drank beer even from a third - how in the USA series?! - they threw empty bottles around on the beach.
They kept shouting at each other.
It wasn't English, though.
Then they went to drink wine, even from the bottle.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in the brand swimsuits, especially those young ladies - in the water barbers and screams, mothers with children and pensioners were scared and in half an hour they were no longer on the beach or in the pool or no black guest.
Everybody's gone.
No matter whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel employees were afraid to talk about them.
The priest said to me in a loud voice last night, "Have you seen the gold they had on themselves?"
"Yes," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't have it from work," said the clerk.
I remembered, "I know, everyone had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one of them had on his neck about 20 inches [20 cm] massive gold cross.
And women were like goldsmiths.
"Are these drug addicts?" I asked.
"You've seen them drinking," said the priest.
Drugs don't eat, they don't even live.
They're doing something completely different.
So it was clear to me what they were chewing.
However, in June 2105 it wasn't that important to me yet.
I didn't know what was going to happen.
But secret services and top politics should have known that first.
I don't think they'd know.
About 1.5 million immigrants were released to Europe at that time.
And they went, and they went.
Today it has been shown that the main problem of the European Union is that total-political-correct policies, like intellectuals and their binding lobbyist and economically important groups have the greatest strength in Europe.
Germany and its policy - today the most widely recognised force in Europe - lies, lies and lies - but not only they, as well as the EU and television points, including ours.
For example, recent television images about the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are on the level of pictures of Moscow's television from August 1968.
Of course, there were a few sunflowers at the station, but mainly - old Germans - Muslims welcomed their compatriots.
For weeks they have bluffed in reports on Czech television, as if according to some research the Germans are almost all for the arrival of immigrants.
But who was only a few days in Germany knows it's a lie like a tower.
Which confirms further information.
For example, a famous public opinion research organised by ARD - Czech Association of Public Television Companies of the Republic of Poland.
According to the ARD claim, more than 50% of Germans wanted to accept more refugees a week ago.
That's what our TVs reported.
However, what happened the second day in Germany was secret: the polling showed that 94.5% of Germans no longer wanted immigrants - 67,000 people were involved in the poll.
It is true that Merkel's office publicly in November 2010, that is, five years ago, declared: "Our effort on multi-culture society has completely failed."
Then she said, "Germany gives up the fight for multicultural society."
"All efforts on such a combination have completely failed."
In a country where four million Muslims live, according to it, a strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live by themselves without integrating themselves. Today they live here with us and we have been pretending for some time that they will not be left to disappear once again.
But it's not a reality.
The multicultural approach, when we say we're just living happily by ourselves, has failed this approach.
He just made a mistake.
But even Merkel has no power to go against powerful Germany and Europe and, above all, against political justice.
It shows the escalation of events.
The conflict is rising rapidly.
EuroGerman Schulz, President of the European Parliament, MP for the SPD, the only one who probably does not have a degree in the Europarliament - yes, that is what Berlusconi said in the EU Parliament that he could play the supervisor in the concentration from a minute to a minute ago - as he has already done.
It seems, in particular, that Germany has exceeded Rubikon.
Note that, to some extent, most European policies do not support these sentences, citizens of the countries that have been victims of Nazism are terrified.
What happened to Germany?
With those rich, successful and strong Germans?
Who have been trying, at least on the outside, to deal with their terrible past of the attacker and the killer of millions?
Do those who say that in the soul of Germany, they are insinuating the devil of aggression, superiority and violence?
Did Otto von Bismarck have the truth when he gave up all his power to try to control the Grand Duchy of the whole centre of Europe?
When did he say the big German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When she was abandoned, the preparations for World War I began.
The idea of Velkon Germany, which led Germany and Europe to two wars, which cost millions of lives, is likely to return in a different form.
After the Marxist attempt to rule the state, for example with the Rote Army Fraktion, and after the failure of the NDR, in Germany, for example, on the basis of ecology, which was, in contrast, one of the main ideas of Nazism, began to develop a new German ideology.
We'd say sunflowers.
German elites have for a long time defended the creation of German nationalism, and so left to peace all those fighters against the atom, the superstitions seeking paradise for all, quietly supported the old imperial and Nazi password Our forest must live.
In order to satisfy the restless young people who all over the world want to do something different and better, they fully leaned on the side of combatants against warming the planet, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there is also a strong anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slovenian flow that all Slavs regard as difficult verbs - since the time of Karl Marx, who, according to the Jewish parents, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as the recent judgments of Schulze and the German minorities show, openly threatening the disobedient eastern states, the idea of Germany's leader.
Which is necessary without apologizing.
Otherwise, it's bothering you!
And when we mix up that immigrants are a very influential group of volunteers, we have what we have.
And behind it is always capital, especially the German, which is to which it is due, and which is because Germany actually controls most of the states of Europe through banks and the Union.
The pseudovirus of sunflowers first introduced Germany into the bazaars of ecology and multiculturalism and brought them home today and will bring perhaps millions of Muslims.
Those who, dazzling siren voices, will soon come upon the wall of reality that Merkel doesn't want to see, and they'll start to wake up.
Germany can only again threaten its neighbours by force, once again part of its population - but, as it seems, the smaller part - is ideologically impaired, but ultimately reality as always achieved.
Will Germany burn again?
The Muslim accommodation is already burning.
What will the German government do when the German public protests against the incoming Islamists explode?
So will Muslims come to help them for a long time in Germany, but certainly not assimilation to take over local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when the naturalized Muslim, Islamic, and German come into being, following the fear of Islamizing their country?
What will he do with Germany, and even with Germany, when people who will be loud and publicly protest against the new euro-surplus Muslim?
Germany just changed.
The conflict that has led to the support of solar ideology in Europe, i.e. the ideologies of electorate and in principle totalitarian, and their unintended banks, is growing.
And because of the unbridled attitude towards disobedient democratic Germans and all substandard and disobedient eastern neighbours, this cannot be done well.
Finish tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of the intruders: scare them to death.
It's enough to stick, and the tough one will stick to you in a way that doesn't have to get any worse.
The head of the reviver will set you up well and startle and stammering, on the way away will accompany (as soon as it is started) the unrelenting seller and the reviver dry.
Maybe it's a shame that you can't really fix your talking pad.
And we'd be looking for a lot of scissors and scars.
Oxalis corniculata (Oxalis corniculata).
A small apple that tolerates the dry environment.
And that's how it's between the outdoor lawns near my place.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which still belongs to expansive flowers, but looks at it and creates a nice impression of the flowering.
It's between the outdoor lawns.
She's unquestionable, she's doing it in our garden.
He likes a dry environment, he's easy to adapt, humble and unmanned.
They're making leaves with chaotic composition, but that's why they're worth watching and taking pictures.
In short, there is only a beauty of detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with purple accompanying.
Brazilian Paediatric Society Rio Grande promotes healthy diet when breast-feeding
Brazil’s paediatric company SPRS came in a shocking way to try to provide women with knowledge of the importance of good food by curing images of children sitting on their breasts painted with an image of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that deliver to infants all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to the energy requirements, it is recommended that pregnant women and newborn mothers increase their daily caloric intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should take.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually influenced the genetic makeup of their children and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that poor diets had a negative impact on the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, although Nina's trying to take over management at Today's Show
On the basis of Karl Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberry, due to the absence of liberal leadership, it was not possible to create a sufficient increase in evaluation for Today.
Nine's morning show from national capital after Malcolm Turnbull's hit by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise and his host David Koch and Samantha Armytage met in London as part of a week long series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
Aussie TV did not seem to care so much about this remote tyranny as it recorded an average of 397,000 viewers in five major cities compared to 330,000 broadcasters today.
Today, the increase in its assessment compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was up to the last quarter (343,000).
Today, in the last few months, he's filling a gap on the Sunris.
In August, there were in Today an average of 318,000 compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was moving between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 spectators and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
Wind changes affect more than Parliament this morning, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are doing well, thank you for your advice!
Added TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
A big report for Seven was the amazing debut of 800 words with a former star Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently born father, who decides to move with his two children to the eastern part of New Zealand, has on average a very impressive 1,219 million spectators.
Critics were wondering if Thomson would be able to shut down a TV hit without the rappers Rebecca Gibney star.
The result of last night is a clear yes.
The X Factor from Seven has left strong 1,136 million spectators, and has rapidly defeated The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726,000)
Seven recorded mixed surveillance the second night The Chase Australia.
The first half of the new television quiz (from 17:00 to 17:30) that Andrew O'Keefe' had on average 446 000 viewers.
The second half (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators — enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613 000).
On Monday evening, the first half of The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 spectators and a second half of the incredible 720 000.
Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Thanks to the decline in the assessment of The Chase Australia from the second night, Nina will be convinced that the Hot Seat at 17:30 will finally win.
The Chase Australia is replaced by a million Dollar Minute series that failed to beat McGuiru's show.

Three in the finals agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will choose?
A secret discovered?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezan Markoski may not want to find out who wins Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood comes to Bachelor's, she's covered with an inexhaustible secret.
And the three girls who stay will certainly not tell you who the right one is, who will finally get the rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two left, thankless told us who won.
Sam Wood's got a tongue for his teeth at the Thursday's final.
All three women lyrically wondered why Wood was a perfect man, quoted his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive why they wanted to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If not, who will get Wood's final flower?", their answers could work as a coyote about who wins the heart of Bachelor.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and the Markos quickly named Mackay as the one who would be the best to go to Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been sharing a light relationship since certain days.
"From the moment I entered the house and observed Sara and Sam's energy, I felt they were pretty compatible and I still think so during the course," Jeavons-Fellows says.
"Sarah is a truly earthly woman, she's very funny with her," said Markoski.
I saw them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They're good together, and they're happy.
Sarah Mackay thinks they could make a nice couple with Sam Wood.
For her own claim that during his last visit at home, she realized that Wood might be "the right one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this isn't just a game - I've now opened my heart to him," he says.
I asked who Wood would choose, if not for her, to look mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I like both girls alike - it's between Snow and Lana indecisive.
Bachlor's on Wednesday at 7.30 on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start her NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in his move to the United States, and many teams asked about his great start of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and looks like a reasonable decision.
Some coaches left Hayne sitting after the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which he made in the conversion of the Australian rugby league during his first exhumation from the upper ground at Tuesday's victory 20:3 in Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and put him in the game after Reggie Bush was hurt.
Tomsula was also still honest in the box after the game.
Instead of feeding the new ones before the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at the press conference after the match.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, also announced that Hayne also received encouragement from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the mistake and take care of only another game.
During the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne made his mistake.
It certainly wasn't the start that Hayne and his massive Australian fan club hoped for at his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught up in the fall when he left the field after a mistake and later told the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 worse career start in the NFL.
"It happens, you're just focusing on another game and that's all," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the traps to his original debut in 2007, when the recording in his own white territory led to the three Queensland.
It was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne posted a photo with fans on which he holds an Australian flag on his own Instagram.
Elton John and Rus Vladimir Putin will take part in a discussion on the rights of homosexuals
In 2003 Russia's richest man Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested in targeted guns at the Siberian wound.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was sentenced, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his democratic efforts limited.
The U.S. has become the emigrators who have been making return payments on their property.
Two of them emigrated in 1984 and their property acquired a new owner.
After 1989 the property could no longer be returned, so the two returned to the state to claim damages under the Non-Sovereign Rehabilitation Act.
The court first appointed them the required amount, i.e. over 2.8 million crowns, but their claim was amended by the court, which granted them only a few nine thousand crowns, indicating that the amount of the refund is determined in accordance with the 1991 price rules.
The Emigrants became the Supreme Court and attached to them the amount originally charged.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, has turned its complaint to the US.
In the meantime, there has been such a change in the social and economic conditions that the refund granted under the then applicable legislation - although it was then an adequate refund in relation to the property concerned - today only reaches a fraction of the value of the property.
"This can't go to the burden of the side-partners to repay the eligible persons who claim their rights at least since 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to grant a refund before," the judge explained to the rapporteur, Jaroslav Fenyk, why the U.S.A. has been on the side of immigrants.
"The U.S. has repeatedly expressed itself in order to ensure that the General Courts proceed in return in such a way as to prevent possible inconsistencies from being settled in the failings of authorised persons and to always achieve the purpose of the Return Law, thus eliminating the property offense caused by acts of the former totalitarian state," the judge added.
Evatu in music Studio DVA now creates Radka Fischer.
Radka Fisher, on the other hand, became the world's youngest Evita, when in 1998 she became the wife of the Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech introduction of this famous musician Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice in Prague's Spiral theatre.
To return to the same role, he says, "Evita's demands today have not been well-balanced."
Evita's not just a great role, it's also a responsibility.
In the role of the first lady of Argentina, Monika Absolon recommended her.
I saw Moncza in Evita three times, and it certainly was inspiring to me.
I saw a whole new concept here all of a sudden.
I'm in favour of the most modern adjustments, but this is just said in particular.
"The direction of Ondřje Sokola is original, remote and contemporary," says Fisher.
The two singers come to Monica Absolon's birthday concert on September 27th, from 19 hours in Studio DVA.
He's doing Evita's music song tonight.
The experience will certainly include a joint duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Utish your cry, Argentina!).
In a limited number of performances from the director's pultic will also jump off Ondrej Sokol when he represents the film of Karl Roden in the role of President Perón.
In the interest of the public, further terms were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech world music studio Evita introduces the studio Studio DVA in collaboration with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London has been successful since February 2015.
In the state of Ondreje Sokola, Monica Absolon originally studied the main women’s role.
On her side, Karel Roden appears as President Perón and in the role of Che Peter Strénáčík.
The legendary songs from the works of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech texts by Michael Prostějovský sound in the presentation of a live orchestra led by Kristof Mark, who already participated in the first introduction in the Spiral Theatre.
4 people killed after the police shot rubber missiles at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber projectors into a bunch of demonstrators against the new state constitution, he put in the middle of the official.
There was violence on Tuesday night in the Rupande district, about 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the head of the periodic staff, indicates that more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the police station and some threw stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal points out that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before they turned to rubber missiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, they say.
It was not immediately clear why rubber missiles, known for their ability to kill, were traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
This campaign was the last week of violent demonstrations across the southern mountain of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have set up a new province under the proposed new constitution and mitigated their political influence.
Further demonstrations in western Nepal were also recorded by the Tharus ethnic group, which demands the creation of its own country.
Since 10 August, at least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent attacks.
when the four main political parties signed the agreement on the division of the country into the province — a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has continued since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process after the earthquake that killed thousands in April.
Lawmakers voted in Kathmandu this week on the proposal for a constitution, and officials indicated that a new charter should be adopted on Sunday.
We mustn't panic right now.
After losing the ice of the master Lithuania you did not even have a home duel with the hockey player Sparta (3:5).
Don't you have any fear of a disaster like an extralige's entrance a year ago?
I hope nothing like this is happening again.
Congratulations, Folk.
NHC predicts 60% probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A wide low pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verden islands is 60 percent likely to develop tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, the American National Hurricane Centre reported on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low pressure system in the middle of the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles also has 60 percent probability of developing tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, added weather forecasting to be located in Miami.
Google dropped the campaign to choose 11 million dollars for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) stated that it would launch a campaign aimed at choosing $11 million for humanitarian organisations to help thousands of refugees who have sailed the European States in the course of the war of abandoned and poor countries.
Google announced this on its blog a very unusual way.
The report on her blog was published by employees of Google Rita Masoud, on the basis of personal experience, when she washed her family out of Kabul as a seven-year-old.
"We traveled on many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear," Masoudová said.
I was lucky.
But the worsening immigration crisis in Europe is still more families, as it has, willing to help.
All contributions will be distributed between 4 non-profit organisations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that all contributions made through the google.com/refugeerelief website to the amount of $5.5 million double.
Europe faces the greatest wave of refugees from World War II. Most of them come from Syria, abandoned by the four-year war, which has only won 4 million people this year.
Many people also run away from the war of rejected Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For low-voltage diabetes, there may be a useful surgery of fainting
The benefits of losing surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too soon to say whether mildly obese type 2 diabetes patients live longer after the surgery of loss than those who are given non-surgical treatment.
"The data on mortality lasts for a long time," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on the surgery of death, who wrote the introduction to a new study of JAMA surgery.
Operations for loss, bariatric surgery use different methods to reduce stomach.
Reduction of hunger and restriction of the human body to absorb food.
During the years, bariatric surgery was shown to be effective for type 2 diabetes treatment, but the majority of the study was conducted in people with morbidity with a weight index (BMI) of 25 or more.
BMIs measuring the height-related balance ratio are considered to be normal in values between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI values 25 or higher indicate the weight of the person and people with a value of more than 30 are considered binding.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the General Hospital Min-Sheng in Taiwan used data gathered from the study since 2007, which deals with two types of bariatric surgery - stomach bypass and gastrectomy - in type 3 diabetes treatment procedures in people who have been slightly obese.
The average BMI among those undergoing surgery was reduced from 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year, according to study.
In the meantime, BMI remained approximately the same for those who were not given diabetes surgery.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was completely resolved in 36 percent and in part in 28 cases.
In the treatment group, only 1 percent and only about 2 percent of patients were completely resolved for the comparison of diabetes.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were demonstrated "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
Researchers also monitored patients with a blood haemoglobin of A1c that reflects the steady state of blood sugar in the body.
Haemoglobin A1c is best maintained below 7%, according to researchers.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin of A1c decreased by about 9 per cent to approximately 6 per cent.
However, this value remained at about 8 percent in the group treated.
But this better glycemic control - reflected in better levels of A1c hemoglobin - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the group lost more weight bypass than the gastrextomy (18.7 to 14.2 kg), achieved higher reductions in BMI (7.4 to 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1 per cent vs 2.1 per cent) and had a higher probability of remission of diabetes (46.9 per cent vs 16.7 per cent).
While the new study does not show improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from the study of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to lifelongization, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were about 29 percent more likely to survive in the next 15 years compared to a group that tested more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show an improvement in the survival of patients after surgery, according to Blackstone, it is a reassuring result for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"Just here this work is critical, because it indicates that surgery is safer in the lower BMI group," it indicates without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone further claims that people and their doctors should start taking weight really seriously after the decrease in BMI patients between 27 and 30.
"I think we've waited too long for giving people the seriousness of the situation," he says.
I think once you've gathered these genetic changes that are firmly interlinking their bodies with obese and sugary, the road back is really hard.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is not able to capture all refugees, Dalai Lama said, and added that real solutions to the current refugee crisis lie in the near future.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in the home countries of refugees.
Dalajlam addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is devoted to studying ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the United Kingdom.
He claimed that, under the present circumstances, human interest should be put at risk by individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, no matter how amazing, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to solve the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring true peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We need to restrict the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In addressing violence issues, Dalai Lama has also voiced complaints on George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack and claims that "the US's violent response has created a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere condolences in President Bush's letter and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent road.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences," the Dalailams said.
The fourfold increase in the number of children who have experienced a cure in the last 4 years
The Toxicological Centre around the United States reported almost 400% of the increase from 2010 in children up to 12 years of age, which polled a highly alcoholic cure, according to the Toxicological Centre in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Toxicological Centre of Georgia, the number of use of sanitation in children up to 12 years of age reported at the control centre of food increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"Children receive these products more often and unfortunately there is a percentage of children to be taken to emergency," said Lopez CNN.
Some children drink the remedy deliberately, while some want to make an impression on their friends or as a challenge on social media.
The videos on Youtube show the natives how they drink the cure because of the cheap experience.
They reportedly mixed their medicinal product with oral water containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted to the attractive flavor of the medium.
"Children don't think about it could hurt them," Lopez said.
Many more attractive (sanitary) are those that are perfumed.
Sanitation products with honey of strawberries, grep or oranges, which are very sweet to children, are available.
The medicinal product contains between 45 % and 95 % of alcohol.
Especially in young children, several holes can mean alcohol poisoning.
"It's a highly concentrated alcohol," said Fox 4 station at Kansas City Medical Director at the University of Kansas Hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn't have let the glass of whiskey go down like that, but people leave these sanitations outside, and when they get kids to them, it's a fast way to consume alcohol.
Nhaija Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently attended school saw up to four folds of the sanitation plant with strawberry flavor and was taken for emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is a double value of dust considered to be drunk in adults, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who took care of her at the Guinnett Medical Center outside the Atlantic.
Nhaija spoke words that were not obvious and was not able to walk after she arrived at the emergency.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a single baby hospital for any signs of brain trauma, because the girl fell down and kicked her head, Ritchey says.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, Nhaija's mother.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended to parents and teachers the use of non-alcoholic products or to arrange for children’s access to sanitation.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some remedies have been associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after the collection of a cure containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Doctors thought that the product contained methanol, a deadly substance, rather than ethanol, which was indicated as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year-olds in North New York planned to poison their "bad" teacher by placing antibacterial products in the room," according to the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitation and banned their presence in the room.
The police judged the moderated plan as "innocent complaints," and referred to the discipline of the school district,
Fama: No conflict in Celtic team
Griffiths is baggagetizing the talk about the dissatisfaction in Celtic, while Dela admits that Hoops is in the wrong place, but he's turning it around again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton fear that the new forces from the ice will break the team's unit.
Dons increase their jump over Celtic by 5 points
Penalties from the first half of ADAM Rooney's administration assured Aberdeen of a close victory over Hamilton in Pittodria, which gave Dons a five-point jump between himself and Celtic.
Griffiths refuses to talk about dissatisfaction.
This situation has led to riots in Celtic, which have been opposed by Griffiths, who insists that he and his associates do not work under any pressure from increased supervision in preparations for the battle with the Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are happy about it.
Lack in Scottish title rivals bore the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Deputy Rangers and former Dutch representative Ronald de Boer claims that the Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because they no longer have any rivalry for title.
De Boer, who is currently Ambassador Ajax, says, "In the Netherlands, they don't show it the best of Celtic matches anymore, and why?"
Because there's no Rangers.
Now people don't just talk about the Rangers return.
He's talking about the old company.
They're talking about both teams together, and they're just interested in that.
In the old company's games, there's a lot of tension and not only people from Scotland are watching these games.
I'm turning things back to the good, Deil's committed.
ROONY DELIA admitted that Celtic was a bit confused, but the Norwegian boss promised that things would turn back to the good.
The defeat of Malm and the subsequent defeat of the League of Masters was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now concerns the top of a five-point board.
But Deila says, "Celtic's been through a bad time and he's getting up again."
Now we want to get out of it as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating, and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad with the current action.
We're quite the same - but we have to move on.
Really, we really need Celtic support, because thanks to it, players are much better.
Now it's very important to stay with you.
Warburton's worried about the icebox.
Despite the comments that appeared a few weeks ago and indicated that he had already identified some of his January goals, Chief Rangers Mark Warburton is concerned about the large purchase of power and insists that he does not want to disrupt the Ibrox team.
Former Chief Brentford says, "The ice crossing window is very different from the summer."
Players coming in in summer have a whole pre-season period to stay, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes there will be more damage by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Transitional objective of Celtic Michu indicates retirement
The attacker Swansea Mich, who was connected with Celtic in a transit window, indicated that after breaking his contract with Swansea, he could go to retirement.
A 20-year-old shooter has already had two years of trouble with a hanging angle and has failed to find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight SFA for comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1 when Patterson was sent into the closet and finally lost 3-2, but the red card on this defense was later cancelled - one of the third red cards issued by the judge Colum, who was withdrawn.
Neilson stands behind his claim and says, "I didn't doubt integrity, I didn't comment on the performance."
Griffiths committed to avoiding Tynacastle
The stubborn Hibbe was severely beaten after admitting that he was singing a song with a text aimed at the former player Hearts Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place in the Roserburn district of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Derby in Tynacastle in March 2014
"It was a derby and it was an emergency moment," the attacker said and continued: "I can safely say I'm not going back to Tynacastle unless it's in Celtic style."
The Council in Tanzania believes in Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United still believes in correcting the situation with the current team management - but admits that the fall in the game must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready for action again," said Donnelly.
McCinnes likes to be a "sudden victory" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to be desperate to hold against Hamilton Accies in order to get them the seventh league victory after themselves and a five-point jump ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to the first half of Adam Rowey's administration.
McInnes says, "There's no team that won anything, whether a cup or a league, without winning this type of game."
Scotland's unemployment remains unchanged while the UK's total unemployment is rising
INFORMITY in Scotland remains unchanged in the period between May and July 164,000, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The Scottish unemployment rate was 5.9 per cent higher in the UK (5.5 per cent), as reported by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland decreased by 12,000 during the three-month period, the number of workers now stands at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland decreased by 70.0 per cent during the quarter - which is the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
The Secretary of State of Scotland David Mundell said in a comment on the latest data: "The long-term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly the year that Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we witnessed further improvement in the labour market and Scotland's employment grew, while unemployment declined.
Why was I a witness to the reform in Oklahoma?
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I'm going to watch a man die.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in the gallery in the death chamber of the Oklahoma State Prison and see Richard Glossip, who's going to be repaired by a lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four officers who would testify to his death.
I first received an invitation in January through my best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day draws on, I'm starting to be afraid of it.
So why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists should be allowed to follow the corrections in America, and because there are often more requests than free places, a morbid lottery is conducted, which will decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma reduced the number of posts for journalists from 12 to five.
Anyone who's chosen will follow the whole repair uninvited.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've made a special vacation for him through a month's phone call and a two and a half hours' visit.
I like that kid.
We laugh often when we talk together.
Prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a note block and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'm going to have to remember all the details.
One Oklahoma journalist accused me of compromising my integrity on Twitter.
This is a lesson.
Tell him the story of behavior as soon as he can talk to him, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "she could have formulated it better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could ever remove me from the witness list.
But he wants an international journalist who'll be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help the proceedings against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a Huffington Post journalist, will be on my side.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details here again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His acts after Barry Van Treese's murder would make him guilty of a felony crime.
But I believe there's a great probability that he's innocent of murder.
I certainly believe that sufficient evidence to justify the death penalty has not been provided.
In my opinion, the correction is wrong.
And from this point of view, I'm going to watch his death.
I can't say I'm really being objective.
To this end, you can turn to other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the man I love dying the rest of my life.
A man escaped from Canning River after a police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after he expelled the men from Canning River.
A man's cousin from Petrha, who is running away from the police, didn't leave after he got into a small pool of water just a meter from a policeman who tried to talk him out of violence to get back to the shore.
The police from Canning Vale were called in during an incident that went over to Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to escape them by escape from the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and repeated "I'm not going out, just come for me," said Sergeant Schhandel Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec just didn't want to wear a uniform, so he tried to use a safer tactic and a police negotiation."
"People sometimes try to do something fun," Castledine said.
The Ben Cousins football champion gives a memorable example.
In 2006 Cousins drove a car into the basement to avoid the bus and tried to cross the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired locals to start planning Ben Cousins' biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the editors tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race
Peeter Moody accused the editor of racing Victoria of trying to get a spaghetti last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He focused on the director and integrity department Racing Victoria and came from the belief that they had a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's late kidnapping during the day of the race, which was the last stop for him on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for the race and was in a difficult situation when it came to Lidarin's positive harvest on cobalt, which he couldn't explain.
He went into the language about the espionage charge for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry threats."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you're just feeling so frustrated that it's all coming out of you all at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'm gonna have to live with what I said.
I'm going home today and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to go head up and let the owners think I'm doing my best for them.
If I start to think otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'd have to consider what I'm going to do with my license.
Earlier Moody released a bomb in his interview for racing.com that the integrity of the department tried to spy on him.
"Before eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with a man - whom I will name on the question - and offered him employment in my booths for finding information about things happening in my booths," Moody said at Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was a cheater.
If that's the case, everyone should show their information because they're trying to catch me completely.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current president of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I think it's a personal matter?
Will RVL grow a few balls and arrange for people outside the training position to take responsibility for what's going on in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really so bad for this industry?
Maybe people here think they are.
Maybe they need me to take my license and get me out of here, and I have no doubt what I'm saying to them now gives them the material to think about.
But I got to the point when I don't care anymore, and I'm sorry about that.
I'm really sorry.
I'm going to press on them and I'm going to put a burden on them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The frustrations of the coach increased with the long-term investigation of cobalt, including Lidari, and the recent kidnapping in it gave rise to the feeling that "the hour could be your license on the table."
Mood, the most famous for the preparation of the undamaged Black Caviar champion, marked the treatment rule on the day of the race for "Laughter" after the horse was applied to his feet with clay or mud, which is contrary to the rules.
It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
Someone from my team was wrong to bring a blue on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and so did it.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for the treatment of the siege on the day of the race to which the authors had already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
The cobra driver he caught was arrested
The police arrested a man who hit a cyclist on the weekend in Cobra and left after he left.
The cyclist was transported by plane to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by cars on Murray Valley's main road on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver left without stopping and helped the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia confessed himself to the police in Shepparton.
It is expected that it will be charged with an accident, a failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobra, stays in hospital in stable condition.
Coach Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy returns to rivals due to wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, coach Melbourne Storm, criticised the actions of his players as "setting the plan" to two NRL favorites of the premiere.
Trent Robinson, coach Sydney Roosters, said the decision-makers allowed the players of the Storm to "wurst" his players during the controversial victory of the Storm team at the final qualification in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach Brisbane Broncos, made an easy-cut note on Strom after his team won the final qualification over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game "prelude" the rugby league and according to him two of Queenland were not "too big" on wrestling.
Bellamy defended his players' moves and said they focused on "contact."
Bellamy added that this situation increased his self-awareness because his team was criticised by two leading coaches, which may mean they are afraid of losing the Storm team.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we were defeated 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that in the last year, we haven't changed anything from our defence system and technology, we've only spent the last few weeks focusing on contact during the events, which meant turning.
Trent's been here for three years, and he's obviously training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which could be a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how such things always come into this part of the year.
Bellamy downplayed Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's team St George-Illawarra Dragons won the 2010 premiere by playing "funny" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He was right in that his Saturday game was as exciting as ours. He was as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St. George was criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he's got a team that can play a style game that seems overwhelming to him, especially his young supporters at their speed.
Such a football you'd like to play if you had this type of player available.
He said that in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his football style - but not every team has two hostages like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It stirs me more self-consciously because they say things like that because they are afraid of fighting against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got into big fights.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that in the Storm and Roosters match, more branches fell than in the Broncos and Cowboys match.
The Broncos team game was probably good, wasn't I looking, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or is it interesting to stop and do not score?
I think it's an agenda.
If they mention us, it means we'll meet again in a certain phase.
Storm has a break this weekend and won the right to host either North Queensland Cownboys or Cronulla Sharks at the preliminary final next Saturday evening in AAMI Park. The tickets will be sold from the morning of the next Tuesday.
Serbian man won $20,000 bail for drug charges
A man who faced a possible life for holding 40 kilograms of cocaine that was stolen from Queensland received a bail of $20,000.
Marko Maksimovic (29 years old) was one of five men who was arrested last month by the federal police looking for 100 kilograms of drugs from the Solay yacht, who came from South America through Vanuatu and landed in Coomer in August.
Maximovic was seen at a meeting with the defendants at the port in the morning and later met them at Coomer Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kg of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Even though he faced a potential judgement of his own business-quality cocaine experience, Lawyer Maximovice defended that there was no evidence that he owned the entire quantity and that he could be in the cafe entirely by chance and innocent.
Judge of the Supreme Court Peter Flanagan believed that Maximovic would escape.
He has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in the middle of the court.
In the Crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
The mother and stepfather Maximovice jointly offered 200,000 USD bail for his release.
"After reading both persons' sworn statements, it is obvious that the deposit of USD 200,000 is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
Their own efforts were evidently insufficient, for the accused did not remain in court, warning.
Maksimovic was given bail on the condition that he surrenders both an Australian and a Serbian passport, will report to the police daily and will observe the ban from 18 hours in the evening to 6 a.m.
Steven Hogg used the girl's phone to get pedophiles to send pictures
Pedophile used the phone of a eleven-year-old girl to get pictures of abuse of children.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone when she was asleep, then logged in to her online chat, where he had a lot of bad pictures of kids who sent him another user.
The girl then checked out and found out that she was missing her phone and then found it in Hogg's sleep.
She passed it and before she told her mother, she found disturbing news.
The police took five photos, then the analysts found the address and found "anxious" searching on the web using expressions to search for unbalanced images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that his reason was "to bring pedophiles" on the internet before he "pretended that he was a police officer and scared them."
A fiscal representative, Elid Robertson, told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it's addiction - he's dependent on fear of people.
He admitted that he was doing a computer search, but he claims he just wanted to pretend he's a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send others.
According to him, he was doing it to get them.
He claims he's been through alcohol and said he wants to see images of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added, "When the girl found the news on her phone, she called her mother, she was scared and cried.
She saw unbalanced images on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interrogated and talked about how the accused used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, resident in Ward Road, Dundee, blamed the appeal for the adoption or the provision of inappropriate images of children on 14 June last year, violated the conditions of bail on 25 January and failed to be heard at the court on 24 March of this year.
A defense lawyer, Gregor Sim, asked Hogg not to be placed on a list of sexual delinquents, because he could argue that in his act there was "no basic sexual subtext."
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed his judgment in October on the application of the social workers' report.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but was held in custody before hearing about other unsolved cases.
He was placed on a list of sexual delinquents before the date of his judgment.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe presented the wrong speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell earlier this year on the stairs leading to the podium.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of his fall became viral in social media.
The opening of Parliament was also confirmed by the opposition legislators' claims that they received anonymous threats of killings that they had warned them of Mr Mugabe's execution during his speech.
Last month he was drafted and provoked during his speech on the state of the people in parliament - which is the word he repeated on Tuesday.
The president of the Movement for a Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians adopted text messages on their mobile phones with a warning not to prevent Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The report comes from a number that doesn't appear, but it's called 'death'," he told reporters after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in parliament and as soon as it leaves Parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief stated that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai has "supply" about threats to the Members.
Hewlett-Packard is going to reduce the number of jobs by 30 000.
Hewlett-Packard abolishes 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save the costs of business services.
HP will later be divided into two companies listed in the stock exchange and will deal with computers and prints from their faster growing company hardware and services operations.
The expected reduction in the number of jobs will result in a change of about $2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, according to the HP declaration.
"These restructuring activities will enable us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, CEO of HP and chairman of the representation, which will be headed by the unit after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than it is today, and will have a wide and extensive portfolio of shops that will help businesses move into a new style of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving requirements of our customers around the world.
The company Hewlett Parkcard Enterprise will receive more than $50 billion a year after the company's declaration and "will focus on providing non-competitive integrated technology solutions" to the company.
This will result in the deployment of the company, which was founded in 1930 by the University of Stanford by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, the manufacturer of electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was renamed "the home of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone massive reorganisation to manage the transfer from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This trend of HP, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technical companies in America, is the latest in this sector based on the belief that a highly specialised company has better results.
Captain Arsenal Mikel Arteta says co-workers must get hurt Jack Wilsher in front of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed for Wilsher that it's still September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there's no reason he doesn't play again about Christmas.
This best scenario already means that Wilsher certainly misses at least four more English games and, from a historical point of view, his involvement in the next annual European Championship is obviously not.
The big damage to this latest problem is that Wilsher ended the last season strong after injury to the ankle and then got back into the former shape during the pre-selection.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger says.
It's a wound that requires treatment.
There's nothing special about it.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injury he suffered before.
This could be true from a medical point of view, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There's also an unpleasant pattern here.
The research carried out by Primer Injuries Ltd has recorded 23 different injuries to Wilshera since six years ago.
During the last five years, he played only 65 league matches in Arsenal from a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in the sixth of the eight seasons from 2007-08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs, which lost most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the charmed circle, but Arsenal believes that improvement in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back after injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win a competition," Wenger says.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will have a career he deserves.
Arsenal starts a campaign in the League of Champions on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey didn't travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are probably coming in.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
"I try to maintain balance and let players who need it breathe," Wenger says.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite for the F group, Maximir in Zagreb has the reputation of the most frightening stadium in Europe.
Dinamo was also not defeated in a total of 41 matches after last season held the campaign "invincible".
The stadium was struck at midnight by an earthquake of 3.2 degrees Ritchter.
This year, in Zagreb, it's been forty-one years.
Wenger thinks that Arsenal has learned from the last season of the League of Champions, when he was capitalising against Monaco, and remains far from his hope that he will lead the club to the first victory in the European Cup.
"This setting is amazing," Wenger says.
Arsenal never happened.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I have to be a realist.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar views in various shows is striking, especially since men need to be more desperate than ever, as it is true of suicide among young men under 15 years of age.
In 2013 it was the only cause of death in men aged 20-45 in Britain and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to solve this problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) marked 2015 as the Year of Men, whose aim is to question the culture that prevents men from looking for help if necessary.
In the heart of this battle there is friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of over 2000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that in case the injured had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of healthy friends represents a half chance of mental problems.
But in order for friendship to work, of course, it must be possible first.
In this communication through social media with emphasis on style and not on the content of the message, the immediate response is often prioritised before meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, we have doubled our need to look stronger, more loving and more successful, even though we are actually more isolated.
This surface success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all under our real values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - that have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and player recently explained, money really doesn't buy more luck.
The beauty of the series Friends was the source of this thought for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their qualities, which were reflected through friendly interaction.
Joey's humour and Chandler's frequent victims, while watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross's desire for Rachel, all the insights of knowing that, yes, men can also identify with it, even though they usually leave their feelings for themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me: ..."My role as listeners to people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies has really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel a lack of communication with friends.
The old order "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up problems.
Friends are one of the things that will come to mind when I try to offer a longer-term reconciliation mechanism.
He highlights little moments in a man's friendship.
As for my task, the state of the outside on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support must come from a closer, network of friends and family.
So if you're going to the FredsFest scheduled Comedy Central station this weekend, why don't you take your friends on a glass to Central Perku, where the interior for the occasion of the celebration will be completely reprocessed.
Or if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship can make.
The series Friends will be broadcast at Comedy Central station from beginning to end - whole 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped the PSG instead of Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuid and Edinson Cavan after shooting the branch against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored his debut in the League of Masters and thus helped the PSG to defeat the Swedish Malmo team on Tuesday.
Here's a report on the game's fight and reaction.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in the Tuesday match and Paris Saint-Germain started their trip to the League of Masters with a final 2-0 victory against Malmu at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria shot the white one less than four minutes after her debut in Lisa Masters, and this player PSG sent French champions after the victory, but then they threw a few chances until they finally raised their lead when Cavani shot the white one in 61 minutes.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, and therefore the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, because they focus not only on the qualification of the rounds, but on improving their journey to the quarter finals, which they recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they won three points, it was not the classic performance of the Laurent Blanc team and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was before a white marnotate and was later opposed to his home team and club, in which he began his famous career in 1999.
"In the League of Masters it is not easy to win outside or home, so winning 2-0 makes our opponents trouble and looking comfortable in defense is a good start, even though there are things we will have to improve with the season process," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I'm sorry we didn't shoot one or two more branches.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury as one of three changes to the PSG team, which had this weekend's 2-2 with Bordeaux in Lisa 1, but was framed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was marked as a man who moved the PSG in Europe to a new level after a transition from Manchester United that took place last month, and showed why when he ran on the passport of Marc Verratti for Malma's defense and with a beautiful marriage he sent a ball behind Johan Wilanda's back to the remote corner of the branch.
However, if someone expected it to start a great PSG victory, he must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-off and got to this stage, took place with 9 international players in the basic assembly and five defenders and two hidden hostages were a difficult opponent.
But besides shooting Nikola Durdjice, who just passed the remote corner of Kevin Trappa's white line in 34 minutes, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, the PSG himself took advantage of the attack by bad tapes and bad marriage, which was not good even from Ibrahimovic, who could not shoot even five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot reached the network shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavani.
However, he proved to be much more suitable when he came to prepare a chance for his associates and it was from his recording when Di Maria sent a round shot that ended in Wildand's brance in 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour thanks to Cavanima, this Uruguayan head sent the sixth goal in line this season after Ibrahimovic played him after the recording from the left wing of Maxwell.
This ended all Malma's thoughts about the possibility that they could get a bit out of the game, and only the great progress of the Wilda from a great distance faded the hopes of David Louise and the score remained unchanged even at the time the goal of striking Ezequiel Lavezi was unknown at the end of the match.
Coach Malmo Age Hareide later admitted that the PSG was higher than his team, Nor stated: "Our last game in the League of Masters took place in December last year."
Since then, we have played only a Swedish league that is not at the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Downstairs for Paris.
It was a catchy match for them.
Glencore company made $2.5 billion for sale of shares
The commercial giant Glencore, based in Switzerland, who was hit by the collapse of the commodity prices, earned an average of $2.5 billion from the sale of shares under its extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore submits in its statement that it has sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay the debt.
This company, which has lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, is faced with a loss of commodity prices, as the Chinese slowdown in the economy is reducing demand and fuelling the loss of the market.
The issue of rights has been sent to the top of Glencore's stock market in early morning stores in London.
The shares jumped by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 FTSE 100 pensions, which opened by 0.69 per cent above.
Glencore found last week that sales of shares worth $2.5 billion are part of broader plans to reduce their debt of $30 billion, which accumulated about a third
The company sold a new share in the price of 123 pence for the share, which meant a 2.4% discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
Thus, 1.3 billion shares were released at a total price of 9.99 per cent per group.
Concerns about the extension of Chinese growth have reduced the price of iron mines by almost half and coal, copper and other commodities by between 20 and 40 percent.
White House Confirmed Washington Visiting Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping visits the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in his Tuesday report.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on September 25th in Barack Obama's response to a visit to Beijing, where the President welcomed in November.
American President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his even Peng Liyuan to the state dinner that will take place after the talks are over.
"The visit of President Xi is an opportunity to strengthen the relationship between the USA and China and invites cooperation in solving problems in the fields of international, regional and common interest and is an opportunity for a constructive debate on disagreements between the two states," the report adds.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he meets several US technical leaders on his way to Washington and will then continue to New York at the United Nations September.
Obama and Xi are expected to solve the problems, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyberspionage and its growing aggressiveness in the waters of the South Sea.
As a refugee crisis, the Schengen area was destroyed.
The emergency lights fired by Germany have not pushed the European crew far away, but it is already forcing the ship to change course, French journalist Le Figaro wrote.
The European Union decided on Monday to address the refugee problem: it will systematically classify migrants and asylum-seekers as soon as they enter the old continent - especially in Greece, rather than fighting for future division of refugees on the basis of quotas, which are still far from reality.
Six days after the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribution 160 thousand refugees, ministers of the Member States' internal priorities changed.
Before taking care of the final destination of the runners, it is necessary to filter those who are already arriving today and to resolve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Efficient management of the EU's external borders is necessary for managing migration," the text discussed by the Minister in Brussels on Monday.
After the single currency crisis, the EU finds itself in danger in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its determination and increases its pressure.
It renews border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the flow of asylum seekers in this country.
The central power makes it clear that without it there is no free movement in Europe.
As evidence, Austria and Slovakia joined this measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France also consider this, although with different intensity.
Hungary has moved on to this a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are permitted under the Schengen rules.
That it's a domino effect, but it's also blind.
The key question for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, in southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already entered the country.
French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière had an intensive discussion with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea isn't new, but it's real.
In Italy, according to informal statistics, two-thirds of new incoming runners have already been registered and identified with fingerprints.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point in its territory, for they fear more than others to remain in its camps where refugees would gather on its account.
There's a real black hole left in Greece.
On his islands near the Turkish coast, more than 200 thousand people arrived this year, twice as far as Italy was concerned.
Most of them are genuine asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after the overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge burning hole.
Athenes, who are still in the financial gap and who are waiting for a new government, put their hands into the cellar.
This is the starting point for the Balkan road and the source of the current common care for German Chancellor Angel Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
Juncker's commission promises that the check points will be introduced as soon as possible, but it has no number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece relate to Europe as a whole," EU ministers agreed on Monday to mobilize on this front.
It is therefore up to the European Border Control Agency's intervention teams in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity for asylum seekers and strengthen island surveillance.
"The need will be proportionate to the financial resources," warns ministers of the text for approval.
From the point of view of law, they will still have the last word of Athens.
The issue of the creation of genuine European border guards was not officially raised, but Europe is getting closer to it.
The new emergency situation of the eight-year-old has so remedied on the second issue of mandatory quotas and 160 thousand refugees, which the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament have been in the beginning of the year, and which was strongly supported by Angel Merkel and French President François Holland.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They consider it to be an attack on their superiority.
The number, not duty, was kept in the text approved by most of the eighties on Monday.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only solid promise includes the redeployment of 40,000 refugees in the next two years, which has already been reached in June during the EU's Hectic Summit, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven dead under a whale in the Alps, possibly three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists who killed a lion in the French Alps.
According to the German authorities, there is also a woman who survived as one of the affected eight-year-olds.
The previous news from the media said it was Polka.
A woman in her 30 ’ s was hospitalized in Briancon with a serious leg injury.
The dead were made, according to the AFP, mostly forty.
"The rescue action ended, the body of the victim was also transferred to the identification of Briancon," the president of the Hautes-Alpes department, Pierre Besnard, clarified.
Unfortunately it happened around noon in the mountain area of Pelvoux under the top of the mountain Dôme de Neige des Ecrins measuring 4015 meters.
"The sudden wave was 250 meters wide and about a meter high," said the chief of rescue workers Nicolas Colombani.
According to him, a massive amount of snow was about 1,900 feet [3,900 m] high.
Meteorological service today did not warn in the area of unfavourable weather.
Tolerance of the fight with Brago: Finally a real Europe.
Coach Jindřich Trpišovský, at his premiere in the tournaments, managed to pass through the front line of the European League to the core group and now looks forward to enjoying the right Europe with the team.
Famous at the start of the main stage of competition welcomes the finalist from 2011 Bragu and according to the prank she wants to make her play style.
After all the nerves in the exhausting fears, when every goal and every situation could get you on your way to a sleepy group, now we're there and we're gonna play six matches.
Of course we want to win, but we don't have to be afraid of every incassed branch, we can play our tactics and we're not bound by a mere double match.
"Be very happy about this and it's a real Europe, before it was just a qualification," Trpišovski said at a press conference.
Braga thinks he's a top team.
It will be very active, have Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The opponent might be even harder to say that he doesn't have a name, but then in his camp he has a player who gave Manchester a shower three goals.
"It's an excellent whole at the top level of teams," Trpišovský said.
But Brag doesn't consider it to be a clear favorite.
I take it we're playing at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we've both shown in the domestic competition and in the past that we're strong at our stadium, and we want to confirm that," said the viewer whose team lost from eleven duels this season only the opening Superpohr in Plsna.
They believe that Liberec can also make Braze use of his style.
We're waiting for a team that's gonna be strong on the ball, and at the same time they're not usually disciplined for them.
They play 4-4-2 with a quick transition to the attack phase.
"It is a very difficult opponent, but we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players will do it in the field," said Trpišovski.
In the past, we have studied a lot of competitors, which has helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, which we have also helped train.
"And we definitely want, even though it will be very demanding to play according to our notes," the watch added.
Student films dominate the Sand, the international festival begins.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries reported their work in the 15th year of the International Student Film Festival in Písk this year.
Four dozen of them, which were sent to the final by the commission of students and teachers, will be held from 15 to 18 October in the Portyč cinema.
The best of them will be the international jury, the speaker of the Jakub Charvát festival said.
Every year, the festival has its special theme, which is different from the festival season.
This year, she's a detective.
Director of this year's celebration evenings Richard Blumenfeld plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre.
"And of course we also have to resolve the crime that has been committed in our support this year," Charvát said.
Visitors will see the choice of the most interesting of student creation - films played, animated and documentary.
They will be evaluated by the international jury, for example the winner of the last year, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
Festival organizers, like every year, are preparing a follow-up program.
Come Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional player at didgeridoo Ondřej Smeykal, turboshanson group We fly?, plays a band of Zrní or, for example, Petra Hapková with a quote Life at the bar.
The festival will host two photography exhibitions.
The first entry of the graduate of the sand film school and the holder of prestigious awards, including that of the World Press Photo 2014, Jana Ashchenbrenner.
The second exhibition is approaching the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
On the floor with visitors comes cameraman and documentary Martin Čech, the film The Cameraman accompanied his music by Gerhard Gruber and the song parents Brukner, Novotný and Hlach at the studio of Sochare Jan Novotný will baptize his new book 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ondříčka, the patron of FAMO in Pisca, who has recently left us.
Our school and festival are his link to live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop joint ties and film novels," the speaker said.
This will certainly help the Pitching Forum, where students can meet with film professionals, graduate several job competitions at once and get such a job.
The festival is connected with the creation of the Private Higher School of Film in Písk.
Her founders, Vladana's husband and Miloň Terča, organized the first anniversary in 1997.
By the age of six, he took place once in two years.
In the event of a loss of CK, insurance companies are required to pay the customer's claims in full.
The insurance companies should build client claims when the travel office falls in full.
She decided to do so on Wednesday when she approved the amended new law on conditions of business in road traffic.
The travel agents will be able to replace insurance against a bank guarantee, according to the proposals to be submitted to the Senate.
Insurance firms with the obligation to build client claims and above the agreed limit.
The Ministry of Local Development for adaptation takes time, argues against the consumer.
The insurance companies have already threatened to end the insurance of travel offices against fraud when the new payment is due.
But the proposal is also criticised by travel agents.
Without insurance, they're either gonna have to end up or go abroad.
The Ministry of Local Development Karl Šlechtová (for the UN) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation are not eurocomformity.
It noted this year's Constitutional Court decision, which confirmed that the client has a claim for full repayment of money regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive sufficient information on the management of travel offices and will be able to set the right limit, Šlechtová stressed.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but must have such a limit to be feasible," said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek.
He says the bank guarantee won't work because no one gives it unlimited.
"The travel offices will have to finish or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
The Chairman of the Association of Czech Travel Offices and Agent Tomio Okamura (SPD) did not agree with the fears of Kalousk on the basis of a study between the members of the CK.
"Stop leading us lobbying insurance," he said.
The statement of insurance does not constitute a relevant Ocamura, nor does it include any official written statement in that sense.
They're trying to find out if the travel agents are going to make a date, which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.
She also warned Jana Fischer (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the Czech Association of Travellers’ Offices competition, and her colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about climbing stairs to the Czech Travel Office.
According to Fischer, travel agents will not be able to negotiate insurance.
"Consumer protection works," says Fischer.
Her proposal for the release of the contested passport was not approved by the House.
Nor did Vojtě Filip (KSČM) come forward with a proposal to refer the proposal to the Committee for a alleged dispute with the civil law.
Philip pointed out to the travel agencies that he considered to be a danger to consumers.
The rapporteur, Mr Berdichová (ANO), in view of the interpretation of the Constitutional Court, drew up his proposal which would limit the liability of the insured in cases where they could not know that the insurance enforcement did not cover the whole risk.
In the new world, there will be no originally proposed minimum four million insurance limit for travel agents offering flights and a million limit for offices selling, for example, bus tickets.
The margin will remain 30 per cent of the planned entry sales markets.
However, the limit of insurance enforcement will have to be such that, in the event of a failure, the travel agent will cover all customer claims.
The standard, even after adjustments, provides that travel agencies will have to reinstate the travel agency which organises the entry in the sales.
Travel agents will have to submit insurance before the contract is concluded, inter alia, information on the management and number of entry.
The approved amending proposal for a Committee on Public Administration shall also be included with further regular information.
Travel agents will have to provide them with monthly information on the number of passengers and the number of tickets sold, the total price of the tickets sold, and the amount of stocks and markets for and for tickets.
If the local development ministry finds that the travel office has failed to fulfil any of the statutory obligations to the insurance company, it shall invite it, in accordance with the proposal for repair or may prohibit it from concluding new contracts in case the breach of the obligation could endanger the interests of customers.
Novela is also going to adjust the funding of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of aid granted to the mountain service on the basis of its application, which will always be made by the end of April for another year.
The request will contain a report on the use of state money in the past year, a financial plan of expenditure and a two-year perspective.
According to the association, the legislator did not mean what would happen if the insurance company issued the CK contract.
This will not be a waste of tickets, and the customers who bought tickets before they were insured will come after him, according to the association.
In such a case, the CK will suffer a significant loss and may even damage, although its management was in good condition.
One way in which travel agents can address such a situation will be a claim for compensation.
Another possibility will be to go abroad and use a lot of soft conditions abroad and then on our market we will act only as agencies, said the Vice-President of the Jan Papaž Association.
Although the proposal of the new instrument also contains a bank guarantee institution, it cannot be implemented in practice, since the bank guarantee cannot sound an unlimited amount.
In addition, according to the association, the change in de facto current practice is unnecessary.
In the two-year horizon, the whole law will have to be recast in the light of the new EU directive.
The Czech market now operates a total of 942 active insured travel offices.
This year, only three CKs have completed their activity.
Foreign travel offices sell annual tickets worth about 20 billion CZK.
Merkel: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must set up to improve humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of refugees to Europe.
It was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after a discussion with German Prime Minister.
At the same time, she again appealed to the division of refugees who had already reached the EU between the Member States of the eight countries.
We need to help more countries where refugees leave, if necessary, where they stay after they leave the country.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we are on the basis of decent conditions in refugee camps, such as in Jordan and Lebanon, that the German office said that such a signal could also be more financial assistance or closer cooperation between the EU and international humanitarian organisations.
"The social countries also support the German government in promoting a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis in the European countries," Merkel added.
Prime Minister Braniborska Dietmar Woidke said in this connection at the press conference that he expects genuine solidarity from all EU states.
Breakdown of EU runners on the basis of long-term quotas, inter alia, rejects the Czech Republic.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke to speed up the asylum process in Germany.
People need to know first if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to be able to start more quickly with the integration of foreigners, the Prime Minister said.
According to him, it is also necessary that most of the money that Germany spends on the care of the custom should serve to integrate those who have a chance to obtain asylum.
It will take more teachers to get the German out of here.
It's a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if the practice can be integrated, they can benefit us, he said.
Matt Damon luggageizes diversity in the film
Matt Damon confronted the African filmmaker Effie Brown during the debate on diversity with the claim that it wasn't necessary after the scenes.
During the Sunday episode of the HBO Greenlight project, an actor in the Brown series interrupted when she stressed the need for alternative views about black protagonists in the script.
"When we're talking about diversity, you're doing it by holding the movie and not by holding the show," says Damon.
Surprised, she reacted down Brown with disbelief and lifted up "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when comments about Martjan got sent.
Damon and Brown joined the well-known producer Ben Affleck and Brother Farrelly to discuss the finalists' shows.
"I'd like to appeal to people to think that anyone is already the director, how they're going to behave like Harmony," Brown said at the outset.
The only black character that's a hooker that's wearing a white belt.
The producer of Dear White People promoted the finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the right to direct the film; Damon said that their regime "would finally give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was over, the social media exploded in disagreement with Damon's comment.
Twitter user MrPooni said a quote on writing the clip, "Matt Damon jumped into the speech of the only black man in the room, so he can explain to her that the fun is so much so it hurts."
Tweet got more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 people since it was published.
Damon's comment comes at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is in front of the social debate.
After Michael Brown was killed as a teenager in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained a national effect and pressed on the creator of laws and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against colouring people.
In February, the singer Prince made an effort to move, while giving the rated album in the category of the year during the Grammy price transfer.
"Alba are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, the album is still important.
The latest leading Black Lives Matter made a statement in answer to the question of the personality Fox News, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered as an hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," said the leader.
Damon was recently reported on the list of entertainers, producers and mussel media who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the display of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or already met with the pope is not clear.
"American Ninja Warrior has the first winner"
A professional horologist and little Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win American Ninja Warrior on Monday and take home one million dollars.
In the competition, which has just concluded its seventh season, none of the competitors have been able to overcome all obstacles to the track.
During the final season this year, two men raced into the last car, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second span of more than 220 m long rope.
Britten graduated as the first and in a fixed limit and became the first contestant to win a four-piece race in the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero won it in three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave a press interviewE! News immediately after his hard-earned victory and it was known that he was still in shock from winning the main prize worth $1 million.
"It's a wonderful feeling, I've never made more than $10,000 a year in my life," Isaac E said in response to my victory.
"So suddenly... I can't even imagine what it will be like now."
The successful producer Kent Weed provided a magazine interview with The Hollywood Reporter about the course of the finals and why Britten doesn't get any reward despite the fact that he became the first contestant to finish the track.
According to the rules, money belongs to those who finish the track as fast as possible.
"If more contestants are lost, the win will be won with the best time," Weed said.
Although winning the main win would change his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
"I don't think he'd be wearing a scarf in himself.
He's glad he's done what he's done.
He got a warm welcome from the fans.
He's a great man, and he likes his family.
It's a hero for your children and your wife."
Geoff said to me, "If there should be someone who could beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think if I win, Isaac would feel the same.
America Ninja Warrior will continue the eighth season, starting in spring 2016.
The tigers from Detroit just passed by Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the tigers of Detroit, the second half of the season was not just a walk through the pink garden.
Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, is now located in the last place of the Central Division of the American League.
The Tigers just turned back their defeat when they beat Minnesota in the Tuesday battle with a close result of 5-4 at the Target Field Stadium.
The twins missed the chance to approach the Houston Astros team and capture the second wild card in the American League.
Even though for one night only, for Detroit, it was a return of words to Z, which was so incapacitating for them during the second half of the season.
"To play is always fun and does not depend on how," said the manager of Tigris Brad Ausmus.
Tigger Alfredo Simon held his offensive performance and Detroit scored three times in the first two shifts and then another in the sixth and ninth shifts.
Simon (13-9) allowed the rivals 6 1/3 of the fuel and 3 runs.
It was his only third game from the last nine matches.
"This year I want to end with convincing results," said Simon.
“It’s hard to get into the game when you often sit on the bench and that’s why I want to get into the game properly.”
Victor Martinez was hit three times and made 2 rounds and his first download point since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was the first tribune match since the last June game, in which he met four times in the battle against Seattle Mariners.
"He's clean on it," said Ausmus.
"He looked good at the training, burned a lot better and managed to take it to the fight."
Thanks to three rounds at the end of the seventh shift, the Twins got the greatest chance to return to the game.
The middle polar Byron Buxton has been replaced by two points on the left-hand side of the game.
A true polar Aaron Hicks scored a point due to a set thumb and Simon pulled Brian Dozier before he was replaced by a left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy had his only opponent Maure, and in front of him was Colonel Miguel Sana, who fired the ball and ran for two years and left Drew VerHagen behind.
With two ball players and a chance to remix in the second shift, VerHagen managed to send a third meter over two years.
Plouffe has already won 27 rounds over two years in this season and reigns the league tables.
Detroit held the ninth shift, Mauer won two points and Bruce Rondon secured score 5-4 for Tigers.
However, this line was designed by Sana on three fronts.
Detroit took advantage of the advantages and won points at the Phil Hughes game.
The tigers won three rounds in the first two shifts against the successful spider, which went into the game after more than a month's break due to the inflammation of the back muscles.
“I certainly didn’t imagine such a start,” Hughes said, “but during the third shift, I felt that I was getting better.”
After he resisted the effort in the first shift, Hughes left one point at the second metre of Ian Kinsler.
Two departures for the right polar J.D. Martinez took Victor Martinez, who was the first to complete all the years.
Victor Martinez interrupted his 0-21 series.
Third meter Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the game and scored another round, but Victor Martinez was beaten when he tried to reach the third year.
The tigers added in the second shift, when James McCann and Anthony Gose had a score of two and a score of one point and a score of 3-0 on the score.
"That's what got us to our knees," said the manager Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place."
Hughes, who won the number of superheroes, ended up in the third shift without points and replaced him with A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran three years, got six burns and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, a real tiger player, ended the match with pain in the right shoulder.
He will be taken care of by Dr. James Andrews, who operated Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, which is on the list of injured muscles in the shoulder since mid-August, should be in the middle race.
Sancheze will replace the left Daniel Norris, who will return after the injury and rise against the Twins.
Since June 30, when Norris was replaced as David Price's left transponder, he's scored 1-1 after 4 matches.
Since August 20th, however, he hasn't won yet because of the attached muscle.
Tigers and Twins play the third game at the Target Field Stadium on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) is set up by the Minnesota Left-Handler Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for the opening of the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to a wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told the group, whose task is Tuesday's reform of governance.
"China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and expertise and to improving open policies," said the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group to deepen overall reform.
The promotion of parental opening brings new momentum and vitality, also provides a new space for economic growth, Xi says.
The Steering Group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory approaches to the market, the release of border controls policy, the support of state enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and reorganise the residence registration system.
The declaration indicates that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and businesses that are outside the investment limits.
This system will be progressively tested and improved through test programmes.
This step is important because it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensuring the legal environment and making the market more open, states the declaration.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to companies and ensure that companies themselves will decide how to manage their business.
The declaration also states that China will enable the border area to display new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for supporting regional growth.
In an effort to open up the controlled sector by the State, more areas will be opened by private investment.
"The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of companies financed from abroad and provide them with better services," the statement states.
In addition, it will be easier for a foreigner to apply for a permit for permanent stay or for a "green card", thanks to optimising requirements and simplifying the application process.
The rights of lawyers to practise and develop a professional judge and a public representative were also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and the leading representatives Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
In the region of Karlovar, a new bed unit may be created.
According to the Heitman of the Karlovar district of Jakub Pánik (ČSSD), the current capacity of the beds wards of two national hospitals and two private hospitals in the country should be sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
But there are also possibilities for expanding care in the country.
For example, in the surgical department, a one-day surgery centre could be set up, where, according to the concept set out, the performance of the surgical districts that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours would be performed.
In which specific hospitals should be targeted for one-day surgery, it is not clear yet.
In the skin department of the Karlovy Vary hospital, a laser centre could be created again with the possibility of using laser technology for skin disease.
The concept also recommended the establishment of an apalic centre, which would take care of patients with brain damage who are vegetative.
Such a centre should be set up centrally and should be an integral part of the anaesthetic-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility into an island hospital where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovary region, is a bed followed by care, and in particular a patient's long-term (LDN) bed, whose capacity in Njedka is insufficient and above all should be closely monitored for care.
Part of this device should function as a rehabilitating bed and part as a classic LDN bed, recommends the concept.
As he points out, the beds are missing the following care mainly in Karlovy Vary's hospital.
There they could use abandoned buildings after centralization.
In the last few years in the Karlovary region, there is a lack of a social health bed focusing on treatment for Alzheimer’s disease.
This bed is a lack throughout the Republic, so it could also serve other places as the so-called Alzheimer's centre.
Non-methods should be prepared, as recommended, for the introduction of so-called bedbeds to which European funds will be released.
"It is a bed that will be placed on the fields of specialized care and will create space for the translation of patients after a step, for example after a cardiosurgical, neurosurgical, transplant or other step," describes the concept of bed care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
