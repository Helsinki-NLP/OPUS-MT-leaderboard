Anrainers were called up to leave their houses. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant at its shores, additives are produced for lubricants. The factory belongs to Lubrizol of the US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which prescribes particularly stringent safety requirements.
In the work, about 400 people are working. In the past, the chemical factory has made sure that the gas methanthil was developed by a leak in 2013 and the environment is wide-ranging according to faulous eggs. In 2015 about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's water system after an operation crash.
Woman announces her job to look for her missing dog for 57 days
For two months a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and announced her job extra. Seven-year-old Border Collie was taken off from the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days lacked any trace of the dog - but Carol King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake". She and her husband had left Hündin Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had put the dog in panic
In the hope that Katie could stay somewhere else in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says she's gone about four, four and a half hours ago," recalls Carole King to "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie was immediately released. Probably a loud thunder had moved the dog into panic.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. But from days to days they were weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake", who announced her job as a postman to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flow"
57 days after Katies disappearing, Carole King received a call: A man reported to himself and said that Katie was in his court. But when the king arrived there, Katie had already disappeared. She searched for her neighbor and suddenly stood her dog under a tree. "I only hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King recalled according to "Daily Inter Lake". "The tears flowed. People kept in their cars, walked out and hugged us. I thought the whole neighbor knew we had found her."
Losses in the Federal Defense: Machine guns disappear undetected
Friday, September 27, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In the past years, the German army has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of ammunition. Among them are three machine guns. The rest is unclear in most cases. The opposition speaks of a "fearing" extent.
In the Federal War, weapons and ammunition are disappearing again and again - many of which have been untraceable. Since the beginning of 2014, the troops have recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapons and nearly 20,000 ammunition. This is reflected in a list of the Federal Ministry of Defence, which reports on the German editing network.
According to the paper from the Office of Defense Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one weapon and 3474 ammunition have been reappeared. The remaining weapons and weapons are six MG3 machine guns, 11 G3 type guns, four G36 type weapons, six G36 signal guns and two P8 type guns, and 30 MG3 type machine guns.
The extent of weapons and ammunition losses in the federal war is "fearsome," said left-wing agent Martina Renner. This is so much more true, as in the course of investigations, it was hardly found again. The left-wing politician spoke of a "good balance". The runner criticised that the list was not recognizable if under the missing ammunition there were also those found in connection with the investigations against the suspected Federal Defence Officer Franco A.. "And although a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted for the possession of this ammunition," said Renner.
Old tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As observed by Refinitiv, the tanker moved and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was reported as a destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but he remained in Iranian waters for the first time. It was said that he wanted to wait for an official decision from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was set up on July 19 by the Iranian revolutional gardens in the sea road of Hormuz under the pretext to have violated security regulations. However, it was assumed that Iran reacted to the controversial, temporary establishment of an Iranian oil tanker before the Great Britain-owned Gibraltar.
The road of Hormuz is one of the world's most important sea routes. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the global oil export is shipped by the seamen. The tensions in the region have intensified immensely in the past months. The commercial voyage has been brought into conflict between the United States and Iran.
Merkel values the courage of people in the peaceful revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel praised the commitment of the people in the DDR who went on the road 30 years ago during the Peace Revolution. In autumn 1989, courageous citizens had brought the DDR regime into check, Merkel said at a celebration of the Thuringia CDU party on the upcoming day of German unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor recalled, among other things, the occupation of the Stasi Centre. "The state security was taken away from the fears," she said.
Music seeks delivery record
Teslas Quartal may be keeping record ready. Despite the issue boom, there was last loss in the electric car group.
New York.Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost to the stock exchange with the view of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued to be written in Musk. The challenge was to bring the cars to the knowledge immediately. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible for the quarter end.
The investors liked it: Tesla shares went with a plus of over six percent of the trade. So strong the course has not been added for nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs a record to achieve its high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers have to be made in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are few gains. Despite the booms, there have been losses.
Solved: That's why we can't kill ourselves.
A kind of brake in the big brain prevents people from kissing themselves. Scientists of the Humboldt University in Berlin found this to be the result of experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday night. Progress was also made on the question of why children were so strongly opposed to the kitzel, just to ask for more.
Finally, it also showed why the closeness of a kicking hand has already triggered a laugh before the touch. This lies at a deep layer in the big brain, which already triggers the smile in the expectation of the kicking.
According to the data, previous research showed that rats with "laughing" in the ultrasonic area react when they are bitten by humans. This "laughing" will be mediated by the part of the large brain that serves the central processing of the haptic perception.
Laughing is suppressed during self-service
So far, it has been suggested that the brain between self-absorbing and touching can be distinguished by others - so that people can not self-absorb. But now, in the experiments on rats, Berlin researchers found that the laugh as well as the activity of the area of the Great Brain during a self-absorbing process. This is also true if life is self-absorbing. During the alien-absorbing and killing by the scientists, however, the activity in the brain and impulses has been enhanced.
But pass through the self-touching and touching through others at the same time, the laugh is also suppressed. This indicates that the brain of the rat can not just between the self-touching and the touching by other different ones. The new insights made it impossible for people to kill themselves because the self-touching activates a brake in the big brain.
The rats were also trained to kill themselves. Thus, they dropped this initiative in the experiment sometimes early, showed flight behaviour or horror star. This ambivalentity is the same as the behavior of the children. The ambivalentity of the kitzels is a behavioral reaction that is the same for rats and humans.
Catastrophe Discarded: Large fire in French chemical work deleted
The Great Fire in a chemical plant that is particularly dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen was deleted. This was shared by the prefecture of the Normandy of the AFP News Agency on Friday. The fire was broken out at night on Thursday.
According to the authorities, no dangerous substances should occur. The samples taken give no cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the event. The firearm was in use with about 200 extinguishers.
Schools and kindergartens closed
Residents were called up not to leave their homes. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.
Factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billion Warren Buffett
The chemical plant on its shores is made of additives for lubricants. The factory belongs to Lubrizol, U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which prescribes particularly strict safety requirements.
In the past, the chemical factory has already made sure that the gas methanthil was developed by a leak in 2013 and that the environment was much too much to be seen as rusty eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident of about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's sewage system.
Brexit: Johnson criticised by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first sitting in Parliament after the break-in on Wednesday. The Prime Minister threatened to lead the country without an EU agreement on 31 October, but Brussels should not rely on its demands for amendments to the Brexit Agreement.
About Cox, who had been used for the rest of Britain in the European Union, the prime minister said: "The best way to honor Jo Cox's memory and to re-enact this country would be to complete the EU's exit." Cox was murdered in 2016 during the referendum election by a right-wing extremist.
Many times to attack Oslo and Utöya are revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths, a mammoth is revealed on Saturday in Norway to honor the victims. The monument "jernrosene" (German: the iron roses) consists of some 1,000 iron roses. They remember the roses that thousands of people had placed in Oslo in the days and weeks after the attacks before the dom in Oslo.
At the same place, the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be revealed - the roses have been smiled at by people from all over the world, including survivors and victims. For the opening, the crown prince Haakon and the crown princess Mette-Marit are expected to be opened.
On July 22, 2011, Anders Behring Breivik had first shot a car bomb in Oslo's government district and, in the wake of the Utöya Island, dozens of participants in a youth holiday camp of the social-democratic workers' party were killed. 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran Frees British Tanker
The UN General debate did not solve the Iran conflict, but now there is a smaller problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" in Iran could go back to sea. It could be a puzzle in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tank "Stena Impero" on the road of Hormus in Iran since mid-July is back in international waters. After being released by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as reported by the Reederei Stena Bulk.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the Crew now runs for medical examinations to Dubai, according to Reederreichef Erik Hånell. On Wednesday, the ship left the Iranian waters. "It's nice that it's over," he told the Swedish TV SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London referred to the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to affect the freedom of the sea. We are working with our international partners to maintain ship travel and international law," it said in a statement on Friday.
The Iranian revolutional gardens had set the tanker on 19 July under the pretext to disregard the rules of sea law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members went well according to the circumstances, Hånell said. They had behaved professionally in the face of the difficult and challenging situation in the past ten weeks.
Following the establishment of the "Stena Impero", the British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar: at the beginning of July there was a super tanker with oil from Iran, which was intended to be placed on the chain for Syria. The delivery was sent to the authorities according to EU sanctions against the country of war in Syria.
The Iranian spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Mutt measures, it was an exchange business to get the "Stena Impero" released, which was largely returned to London.
The road of Hormus is one of the world's most important sea routes. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the world's oil exports are shipped by the seamen. The tensions in the region have intensified considerably in the past months. The commercial voyage has been brought into conflict between the United States and Iran.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans are putting the Iranian leadership forward to build nuclear weapons. Iran shows this back. The United States came out in 2018 alone from the international nuclear agreement to prevent Iran from building an atom bomb and at the same time to end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the U.S. government has put the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country under pressure to force a more stringent and extended agreement on other areas. Iran so far resists the pressure.
Due to the struggle over the "Stena Impero" and other events with tanks in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the United States is working on a coalition for the military protection of commercial ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace on the road to Hormus at the UN Assembly in New York. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran wants to ensure the security of the Persian Gulf along with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign defence forces.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
In view of the criminal charges imposed by President Donald Trump against Chinese producers, India is forced to re-disposition foreign producers in the People's Republic. Financial heads of Asian companies considering placing their production from China in another country call India in a survey of UBS as one of the preferred alternatives. It is not only free to do so with the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war. With a giant pool of young workers and an internal market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to have created a more significant role in the globalized production chain.
But now India itself has reached the focus of Trump. From the Haudegen in the Weissen House, adjudicating as the "Kingdom of Customs", America has removed the trade benefits for 2000 products from the Schwellland in early June. The U.S. Indians face prohibitively high customs and demand better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spiritos, motorcycles and more.
On the World Map of Trade Wars, the tires with India are freely a sideshow. America also considers the world's largest democracy through the security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington connects concern about China's power claims in the South Ocean. Against this background, a salve of US criminal charges against India is unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just arrived at a second five-year term, should therefore move safely.
The problem lies elsewhere: The empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult position in the Socialist Republic of India. Also under fashion. Its reformer focuses mainly on the bureaucratic Irish, which has long been suffocated by any entrepreneurship spirit in the world. Companies are now given faster construction permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more aggressive insolvency and competition law makes it possible to liquidate companies with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From economic perspective, much has been improved in India in the first five modes of the first five years. However, in trade policy, this is not true. In order to protect internationally low-competitive companies from foreign suppliers, the national conservative government even created new barriers.
In the West, the mode of the Nimbus of the energy reformer, whose country is radically reformed, is dependent on the fact that the charismatic prime minister only knows very well what western managers like. However, in the core, the "India First" advocate never withdrew from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to escape anachronist races and thus to become fit for global competition. Business people who survive because of the removal of their industries are among the root voters of Modes nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and who advocate this short-term policy.
Insertion of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French President Jacques Chirac is scheduled to present a report in Paris next week. On Monday, at the Friedhof Montparnasse in the south of the French capital, the news agency AFP reported on calling the Chiracs family. The order will take place in the close family circle. For Sunday a public mourning festival was held in Paris's invalidity, as media reported.
Convergence led to the goal: Dabo is the first secret hero of Light Athleteics-WM
The world’s tip was long before the goal of playing hot scenes in the under-cooled Khalifa International Stadium. In the first run of the men over 5,000 metres, Jonathan Busby began to move dangerously from Aruba. He could barely stay on his legs 300 metres before the goal, when Braima Suncar Dabo suddenly stopped from West African country Guinea-Bissau and supported him in the last half of the stadium. Both of them were still in order to stop the current armband watch after the finish. As the scene was not yet clear enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpectedly drew the attention of the assembled journalists on himself. Fearing him first, he did not want to talk about his heroism at all. After all, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he noticed that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a suffering companion. And without that he would only be proud to represent his country which was invited to the World Federation. Under normal circumstances he should not have started. "Therefore I am proud to run here for my country," he said.
He did so in the evening with repression - and much more intense as he would have thought so. For this hero's day will remain in memory. At the same time Dabo's rival busby even took the lead in the goal and voluntarily took over the last place - in addition to five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega who won this foreplay. It had enjoyed nothing at the end of everything, because the busby only came to the goal with much help was disqualified at the end of the world's light athletics association.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and is studying there in Lisbon, was able to set up a personal best time at the WM in Doha. According to official data at 18:10,87 minutes, he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. In 18 minutes I was already once". However, only in training, there are no best times.
MILLION MACHINERY: Egypt settles for a wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in advance of possible government critical protests. In the center of Cairo, an enhanced police presence was observed on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were blocked.
Already in the past days, the police had strengthened their street controls and partially searched the phones of pedestrians for news and photos in connection with the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend it was in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura to protest with hundreds of participants. They directed themselves against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and mismanagement. An open protest against political leadership had not occurred in Egypt for years. Egyptian construction contractors and actress Mohammed Ali, living in Spanish exile, who brought the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, called for a "Million march" on Friday to central places in the country. Ali calls for a "People's Revolution". The man is also not a "gooder for most young Egyptians, because he as a subcontractor for the armies of his allies.
The number of arrests related to the protests continued to rise by two groups of observers. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. Independently, these numbers were not confirmed. The government also confirmed and did not comment on the figures.
Voluntary arrests
Many people were "willfully arrested" "only because they were "for the wrong time in the wrong place"," HRW reported in appeal to lawyers of the detainees. The accusations against the detainees range from "distribution of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces were interrogated and searched in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, according to HRW-data, voluntarily passengers.
HRW also criticised the censorship in the North African country. Thus the government blocks in Cairo websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online Dealer: Dealers should be able to make returns easier
For online dealers, many returned packages are lost. Around 20 million returns land on the mine. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online traders such as Amazon and Zalando a way they can spend returned products instead of destroying them.
Although companies could not be exempt from the sales tax on Sachsen, the Ministry explained a question of the Green Party on Friday’s news of the Funke Media Group’s newspapers, but the traders could use the market value of the non-sales return so low that they did not have to pay any or only a small amount of sales tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg found that the federal citizens were returning every sixth package when ordering on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - then landed in the mine. They would pay extra money to the companies after the current legal situation, as the financial authorities estimate the tax on trade.
Green Group Chief Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with an authorisation that companies can provide non-profit products in accordance with the criteria and free of charge to non-profit organisations. The companies had to be able to rely on their ability not to be penalised for donations. This applies not only to online trade, but also to other business from model to construction.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will soon be expanded.
For Branchik, Banksy's work underlines "the restoration of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world to the basic maintenance of animals and tribes". From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the UK capital until it will be increased on 3 October. It will be estimated at 1.5 million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the southwest of Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had re-issued the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29th. On this occasion the work, which was called the "Fragest hour", was renamed "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The picture could change the owner for a million.
Last Wednesday, at the first meeting of the Sub-House following the removal of a forced break by the Supreme Court, Prime Minister Boris Johnson offered himself a hard strike exchange with the opposition. Johnson wants to complete the already moved Brexit twice on 31 October, if necessary without agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, is involved in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the southeast of England, he painted an image that represents a man who deals with a milestone of the European flag. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors daily when entering the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
The violent verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit-Gegen in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his chief advisor. In comparison to the fight against the Brexit referendum 2016, the current controversy was a "walking in the park", said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation. "We will enjoy it. We will (from the EU) resign and we will win".
In the last few days, Johnson had taken a hard attack on Brexit-Genders in Parliament, and had cast them on the people, among other things, and accused them of endangering the Members, because they could become a target of murder, he turned down as a "humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to restore peace was if the Members of the British would finally respect the decision to withdraw from the EU, and it was not surprising that the people were concerned that Britain was still not leaving the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the up-to-date mood, even the churches of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak with respect," he said in a statement. "And we should also listen".
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for a non-intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan again called upon the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict in his first appearance before the UN Assembly.
Otherwise, a renewed war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India was likely, Khan said on Friday at the UN General Assembly in New York. "If this is bad, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have been responsible for Kashmir. "You should have prevented this."
Since its independence from British colonial rule in 1947, India and Pakistan have led three wars, two of which have been divided around the Kashmir region. Both nuclear powers each dominate a part of Kashmir, another part of China. At the beginning of August India's Kashmir region had withdrawn the autonomy status and thereby increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand. It can shoot with sharp ammunition to the population, more than 2000 prisoners join the 60,000 political prisoners who are already sitting there. Protesting was never safe in Egypt. However, since the takeover of power by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything to avoid a scenario as at the time of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the bad economic situation. Poverty, lack of perspective and the feeling of being beaten by the government of its own has driven millions on the road. And this is a problem that also does not get the regime of el-Sisi in the grip, no matter how hard it is against opponents.
Today, every third in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. Whoever wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who he is financing: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for oppression but also the biggest economic actor. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. It was already before el-Sisi so. With authoritarian regimes the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, also the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critically, it will always be when a large part of the population has difficulties to water themselves.
Tuv tests in the terminal: BER-Chief: No more showstopper for main city airports
Two months have been examined whether the complex plant body works in conjunction with the BER fire protection. The operators are satisfied with the course. However, the tube is not finished at the BER.
Following major tuv tests in the terminal of the future main city airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, Supervisor General Rainer Bretschneider said after a meeting of the control board.
Commander Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful completion of the test, but also said that there are still deficiencies to be worked out in the terminal. "We have many detailed topics, but we don't have a real showstopper". He assured that the schedule until the launch includes buffers.
However, there is evidence that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The construction completion notice is now to be submitted during the first quarter of 2020 at the construction office, which was scheduled for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of defects in power cables are still to be fixed; the tuv wants to examine them until February. "To create the conditions for taking up the flight operation, it is still necessary to work intensively on the processing of deficiencies," said a written statement.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is missing evidence, less for new cables. There is no release for all of the doubles that the cable tracks hang on. The airport manager expects it to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection is still not satisfactory at the crossing to the terminal station. The problems had led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoking cuts that go down on a fire like a linen wall so that the smoke does not spread. They go too far down. 36 engines therefore have to be replaced. Then there is a new attempt with hot gas at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other trees as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it was due to go into operation in 2011. Since the beginning of 2006, the cost has risen from two billion to about 6.5 billion euros expected to be opened next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, the managers plan to expand the airport. That is why it will take place at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as announced by the President Bretschneider.
The airport company is now looking for two new business leaders. Finance chief Heike Fölster changes the year to the German railway, staff chief Manfred Bobke-von Camen goes to rent next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster.
Chemnitz: Automated for Drugs - Police Takes Men
He needed money for drugs - and hunted several machines in the Chemnitz city area for it! Now the perpetrators are finally in jail!
Over the past two years, the number of broken cigarette and parking cars in Chemnitz and the region has risen dramatically. A million damage has occurred!
After two detonations at the end of May, the police arrested a 33-year-old German on the streets of the city and at the Further Street in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigations, due to the conduct of explosives explosions in the unit with a particularly serious case of theft conducted by the Chemnitzer Criminal Police, this suspicion was not only confirmed against the 33-year-olds".
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer was now a total of eight works.
The police speaker said, "With the benefits he has apparently financed his addiction to pollution". Only four times the bomber had pushed car park lights on the streets between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019.
The total damage is at least EUR 60,000!
The automatic bomber is now under investigation. Police investigations against it continue.
It is thought that he was also responsible for further automatic surges in Chemnitz and adjacent country circles.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is revising its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the middle of the price struggle with cheap flights such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa's daughter AUA "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", confirmed on Friday a press speaker from Austrian Airlines against the APA. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported on this.
The Vienna base of the Eurowings Lufthansa ticket will be de facto dissolved. Four of the current seven Eurowings flights remain in Vienna. This takes over the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlea", including Eurowings staff. In Salzburg, three Eurowings jets will be stationed to fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines for holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA route and network planning, the speakers explained. The flight times will be aligned to connecting flights. The aim is to strengthen the Vienna route and to expand the decentralized traffic out of the federal countries.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna are still only "production Company" for the AUA Group Sisters. This would include Barcelona and Rome with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings devices. The board product should be adapted to those of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings. Eurowings flying under AUA flight number will not be reported any more in Terminal 1, but as the AUA in Terminal 3.
At the Vienna airport, a price struggle broke out after Niki Square. The Ryanair daughter Laudamotion announced only on Thursday that the fleet in Vienna was to land on 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish airline sends four Ryanair machines as well as crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetleas", which the trade union criticised as an environmental structure for the collective contract.
The campaign by Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary that Lauda has been over the AUA in five years, won on Friday UAA CEO Andreas Otto: "We remain number one in place, in five, six or ten years".
Queen-only Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four is married. Beatrice is married!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: In the early months of Italy's holiday, Edward Mapelli Mozzi (34) held the hand of his friend Princess Beatrice (31). This was announced by the palace on Thursday.
"We are extremely happy to be able to announce our commitment. We are both so happy to start this adventure together and can hardly expect to be married," the couple, according to British media reports since October 2018, shared in the official communication.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that in the years to come, love and happiness will help us very much."
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official commitment photos have been posted on her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also on her Instagram account.
A Royal Feast
The wedding will take place in 2020. Further information on date, place and everything else will be announced in the coming months.
However, it is certain that the comparison of the number nine of the British thrones and the real estate mogul will become a similar big feast as the mourning of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for heart-circuit disorders. But what really solves a heart failure or a heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to see the heritage of 9000 healthy and sick people exactly.
Through the analysis of the heritage of 9000 people, Hamburger and Swiss scientists want to find out more detail about the causes of heart-circuit disorders.
The research project was the largest of this kind in the German-speaking area, the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) shared on Friday. The Kühne Foundation supports the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the Davos University Clinic, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich participates.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are among the most influential risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors determine the risk. But the interaction between genes and external influences is only known, it was called. Now scientists want to compare the complete heritage of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University of Heart and Gastrointestinal Center at the UKE.
Currently, in more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes, possible disease-induced changes of the DNA - called mutations - were known, it was called from the clinic.
The goal of the five-year project is to develop new options for the care, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart weakness and heart disease. The data could also be useful in the investigation of other folk diseases, so Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University of Heart and Gastrointestinal Centre. New findings on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as cancer are possible.
The president of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there is a strong will to use the data to investigate other diseases. The clinic of the Foundation in Davos has been dealing mainly with allergies. Now a center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be created at the medical campus there and a professor for bioinformatics is created. For the sake of his commitment, the logistics contractor in Switzerland said that he was operated in the open heart three years ago and was very grateful.
The bio samples of healthy participants are derived from hamburgers who are also involved in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 samples, according to the clinic, this is the world's largest local health study. In the case of inheritance encryption, strictly considered the protection of anonymous data, the scientists assured. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabyte) of data, said Holger Moch of the University Hospital Zurich.
Today, UKE’s legacy can be disbursed within 24 hours. The pure trial costs are at EUR 1300. The first generation sequence of which were published worldwide in 2001 has cost still several hundred million euros. The study will start on 1 October, at the end of 2020 all 9000 samples will be analysed. The first results will be expected in the year.
Nigerian Police Freed Hundreds of Untreated Boys
In Nigeria the police released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Korean school. According to residents, security forces searched the school in the northern town of Kaduna and discovered the victims, as reported by police spokesman Yakubu Sabo. "The victims were abused. Some of them reported being raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys were held under the pretext to be taught in the Koran and "injured". In fact, the shields of their teachers were held under "the most reprehensible and inhuman conditions", said Sabo. About a hundred students, including children nine years of age, were enlisted in a small space.
The Koran school was based on the data for about ten years. The residents had been paying attention to repeated irregularities in the institution. The parents had been shocked when they were told about the conditions in the Koran school, said Sabo. They had not paid any attention to the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to police.
In the predominantly Muslim northern Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often lacking state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks of armed gangs. According to the UN refugee aid work, therefore, over the past ten months more than 40,000 people have fled across the border in neighboring Niger.
Tortured and tortured: Nigeria Police freed 400 children from school
Police officers in a school in northern Nigeria have freed nearly 400 students from sexual relations. "Many of them were harassed and some had visible injuries that were leading to torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
There the children were discovered on Thursday after a notice in an Islamic school. The conditions there were "humanly unworthy". The officials took the school leader and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were held in their school like slaves and placed in chains. Some were sexually abused. Television images showed debased and injured students in a clearly bad health condition.
World football selection: More projections by Messis and Klopps Kür
Invalid signature
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the Fifa World Football Association features the best player, the best players and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honour and thus record.
After Nicaragua’s captain declared that he had never voted in the World Football election, prejudices came from other countries to the Fifa. Egypt was not valued at all - with a curious reason.
In the past years, many of the Fifa has proved to be a fraud: the WM grants, the dubious plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. The Fifa World Football election has so far not been in doubt about whether or not to run out of the doubt - when it comes to the fact that the qualified national trainers and national team members of the member associations vote more often in accordance with sympathies than in an objective assessment.
However, after Nicaragua had already complained that he had not voted at all, further irregularities were added: Egypt complained that the votes of National Coach Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly unanimous vote review.
The Fifa apologizes for the fact that "the signatures on the electoral forms have been given in capital letters and therefore not valid". The Egyptian Association has been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan Trainer also surprised
There is also a call from the Sudan regarding the election. While the case in the case of Egypt is clear, the Sudanese association states that Trainer Drachko Lugarisic has not voted as well as it has been evaluated: with Lionel Mesi on the spot one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, however, the vote was taken as well, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese association.
In his case, it was assumed that the Nicaraguan football club had just voted in his name. In his case, the Nicaraguan football club had voted in his name.
From Friday the announcement came on Friday: Yes, but of course it was not intentional. The completed electoral submissions were "irrefutablely" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan election, it was in a communication of the association. But he chose the second captain Manuel Rosas. "We take responsibility for the administrative errors", said the statement. Rosas as well as team coach Henry Duarte had voted for the mission, "just as it is in the official list of FIFAs".
The other cases now allow the Fifa to examine in a study, but stresses that the election process was supervised externally by the consulting company PriceWaterhouseCoopers. Lionel Messi remains the uncontested winner of the World Football Election - and Jürgen Klop World Coach of the year.
Ukrainian Affairs: High Republicans speak for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans spoke openly for an official investigation against US presidents and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this comes from, it is determined by the facts that will be established". He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before action is taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the President's suspension.
Scott said he was not surprised by the discoveries. They had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky in a phone call to investigate the activities of the democratic candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Scott observed Trump Biden "for years".
The Republicans have so far remained critical of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair, only a few have found distasteful. Scott's statements are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. Virginia's moderate governor had already turned himself against Trump's policy several times, for example against the lockdown of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
As another prominent Republican, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right course and responsibility for the Congress is now to investigate the matter and to go to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as governor of the United States, have not formally taken part in the procedure against Trump, which is decided on at the Congress. Their statements are therefore of particular symbolic importance. However, even the first senators of the Republicans have been critical of the situation. In the midst of Romney, who represents the Federal State of Utah in the second chamber, said that the case is "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing". US media also reports that the first cracks appear among the Republicans within the Republican.
The affair could lead to the initiation of an official procedure against Trump, which the Democrats have announced in the House of Representatives, and which they have proposed abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the official collection process. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could strive for a so-called impeachment. But the decision on a actual official collection fell in the Senate, where Trump Republicans have the majority. The prospects for such a process are therefore low. So far, no US President has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
Were torturers on board rockets "Sea Watch"?
Three men were arrested in Sicily, they were to have raped and killed in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rockette (31) was arrested in June after she had been on board with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees unauthorizedly controlled the port of Lampedusa. After fierce protests and international criticism - also by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now there are new heavy projections against rockets. Thus, three men who are being tortured in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived with the "Sea Watch 3" in Italy. Suspects were recorded in a recording camp in Messina (Cisilia) after migrants had recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We can't exclude this, but we have not even secured information about it," said the "Sea Watch" speaker Ruben Neubauer of the German Press Agency.
From the police it was said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, raped and even killed. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and massacred - through repeated and persistent physical violence," the message was then stated.
NGOs and aid organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who comes to the ships. "We can't scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Neubauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing Libya. Therefore, it is quite likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this will be followed."
Italian Minister of the Interior Matteo Salvini called for an apology from rockets which are still being found in Italy because of aid for illegal immigration.
Musk seeks delivery record at Tesla
Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost to the stock exchange with the view of new record numbers.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued to be written in Musk. The challenge was to bring the cars to the knowledge quickly. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible for the quarter end.
The investors liked it: Tesla shares went with a plus of over six percent of the trade. So strong the course has not been added for nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars and thus achieved its previous best value.
Musk needs a record in order to achieve its high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers have to be made in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are few gains. Despite the booms, there have been losses.
US budget dispute: Renews only a bridge financing
The new financial year will start in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate was followed by the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing by 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the spending ceiling for the financial years 2020 and 2021, before the new fiscal year beginning on 1 October, the United States is once again without spending plans. On Thursday, the Senate followed the House of Representatives and decided on a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision it would have come to an end on Monday, a partial closure of the federal administration. President Trump still needs to implement the decision.
Shutdown aborted
The Federal Administration is now temporarily funded at the level and in line with the priorities of the expenditure plans for the end of the financial year 2019. This is because the Congress does not have some time to meet the 12 expenditure laws that assign funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the Federal Administration cannot benefit from the new budget year from 1.3 bio. to 1.4 bio.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives. However, the laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. The Senate has also turned around ten of the twelve plans of expenditure, more or less, which are hardly majority-qualified.
Spirits differ mainly on the issue of resource allocation for the area of domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans are obviously trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the wall to be one of the major priorities of President Trump. The Democrats are opposed to the construction plans and their funding, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The battle over the construction of the wall was already escalated in December 2018 and led to a 35-day shutdown.
On the wall building, the spirits separate
It is now unclear how the parties want to get closer to this issue. It is more likely than agreeing on all 12 expenditure laws in the next seven weeks that transitional funding will be extended beyond November 21st. Also, a shutdown is not excluded.
In the light of the continuing inability of the Congress to agree on the twelve expenditure laws in time, and thus the inherent danger of a shutdown will win ideas for the automation of the process of popularity. template S. 1877 for the prevention of Shutdowns would automatically continue the financing of the federal administration at the level of the previous year, suspend the travel activities of Parliamentarians and withhold their salary until the new annual spending plans are proposed.
France allows artificial breeding for lesbians and singles
In France, the artificial breeding of women and lesbians is expected to be open in the future: the Paris National Assembly agreed with a large majority on a government bill, after which all women can apply for in vitro breeding, so that the demand for anonymous coexistence should increase significantly.
In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that many "children without fathers" could grow up in the future. The French Bishop's Conference was also against the renewal.
The new system is the core component of a bioethics law, which the Minister of Health Agnès Buzyn defended as "the chance" for society. It is the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or gay parents. According to her presentation, the costs of artificial breeding for all women are to be borne by social insurance.
Fertilization with sperm of dead husband continues to be prohibited
With a limited majority, the National Assembly withdrew an amendment to give widows access to the sperm of their dead man. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom the artificial fertilization "post-mortem" is allowed. In Germany in the past, there were cases in which women were sadly complaining about the issue of the sperm of a deceased person.
On the other hand, many members of the government party La Republika en Marche (Republika in Movement, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had spoken out for the artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would be "double mourning" if her husband's wish to remain unsatisfied by the death of her husband was still fulfilled.
The initiators of the proposed amendment now find it unfair that a widow may be able to bear the sperm of an unknown person in the future, but not with the sperm of her own partner.
So far, artificial breeding in France is allowed only heterosexual couples who cannot bear witness. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that the motherhood would continue to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial reproduction is theoretically open to all women - for single or lesbian couples, however, it is often difficult.
Remuneration for climate: Call for flight for unis will be louder
A lot is being flown to high schools, and that's why the country wants to have a climate tax in the future. The rectors say they don't have any money for it. But now they're also under pressure.
The schools should also be limited when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian street shield
The discussion that took place before the summer break on climate change on flights from universities and universities is resounding. After the country's director conference had responded skeptically to a corresponding advance from the black coalition, the plans are now receiving support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctors of six Bath-Württemberg universities and a Pedagogical University advocated a compensation for services. This was the first step "necessary", while at the same time there was to be a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, in their opinion. The decision of the doctorate, originally planned in July, is still on ice, because the CDU has not yet been submitted to the Greens.
Russia again captures North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB secret service, the detainees were to fish illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier 161 fishermen were arrested from North Korea. At that time there was a firefight between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later suffered his serious injuries. But this time there were no casualties, it was said.
The communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way in Russian high-level waters. There the Russian Coast Guard will carry their own information to protect their marine biological resources patrols.
30,000 ink-fishes seized
During the re-checks, 30,000 inkfish were discovered and seized on the boats. In addition, three fishing and two motorboats were seized and Nachodka and Posjet were taken to Vladivostok.
Russia's Fisheries Authority had not issued a fishing licence to North Koreans even after complaints by domestic entrepreneurs this year. Thousands of North Korean fishermen have already been arrested in this year, according to the media.
The head of the association of Russian fisheries companies in the remote Primorje region, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained about high environmental damage by North Korean fishermen. They fished closely synthetic nets prohibited in Russia. These would also bring small creatures out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be taken out of the sea where they needed 200 years to be settled.
In the future, only 18,000: USA reduces asylum ceiling
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country of the earth is shielded from protection seekers: As confirmed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Washington, the upper limit on the legal access of refugees will be further reduced. In the future, the most threatened believers and Iraqi asylum will be granted.
The US government wants to reduce the historically low limit for the admission of new refugees again. In the 2020 economic year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, there will be a maximum of 18,000 people in the country, as stated by the US Foreign Ministry. In the almost late financial year, the limit is still in the range of 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the admission readiness for protection seekers from all over the world in recent years. Under the previous government of Barack Obama, the admission limits had been far higher.
The declared ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. Refugee Programme in 1980. The U.S. Foreign Ministry nevertheless referred to the United States as "the most merciful and generous nation in history", a formulation that strongly recalls the use of the official U.S. president.
A "responsibility-awareness" approach with refugees is that refugees can return to their home countries to help rebuild there, Trump explained. For his hard course in migration policy, he has a lot of demands from supporters, but there are also massive criticisms.
A major point of dispute is the border to Mexico that wants to narrow down the Trump. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a temporary link between the current measure and the current internal policy developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the selensky affair and a potentially threatening official collection procedure.
The U.S. government wants to focus on two refugee groups: people who are being persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and thus are in danger, as stated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On the other hand, there should be a maximum of 1500 refugees from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The United States wants to achieve that, in particular, people from this "Northern Triangle" of Central America apply for asylum in other countries. For this reason, the United States has only concluded with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras Migration Agreements in order to prevent migration at the U.S. southern border to Mexico.
Court ordered release of orange-utan from zoo
An orange-utan weibchen has been placed at the request of the Argentine justice from the former Buenos Aires Zoo in a man-made shelter station in the United States. The "sandra" born in 1986 in the Rostocker Zoo was granted the rights of a "non-human person" and is therefore obliged to release it. The animal was taken on Thursday night by direct flight to Dallas - however not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms of heavy human waste are not able to adapt to life in the wilderness, they are expected to live in the future in the free zone of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other oranges and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles", a former pet of Popstar Michael Jackson. Before entering Florida, however, Sandra has to carry out another 40-day quarantine in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the U.S. state of Kansas.
"Sandra" spent several years after her birth in Rostock in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before she was transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 process of animal protection aimed at "Sandras" has contributed to the transformation of the zoo of Buenos Aires into an eco park. By 2023, a research and education site was to be created to preserve biodiversity.
Record for Swiss Extremberger: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme mountain climb Dani Arnold is lucky for a new home ride in the Italian Alps at almost 3,000 meters high.
Without net, double ground or other auxiliary means, the Swiss forced the 550 meters high north wall of the Great Zene in a new record time.
Dressed with Jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute freedom of movement Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the climb. This way he provided the old best brand for almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in the Free Solo Speed at four of the six most important northern European walls.
Nike benefits from a new online marketing strategy
In spite of the trade conflict with China, the US sports producer Nike has booked a significant profit surplus. Net profit rose to 1.4 billion dollars in the last quarter (about 1.3 billion euros). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year, as announced by the Group on Tuesday. The reason for this is the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor directly uses its customers online.
In the three-month period, sales increased to $10.7 billion by the end of August. Nike sales figures were most strongly added to China with a plus 22 percent. Thus, the Beaverton Group in the United States also benefited from its approach to the consumer via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Finance Manager Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to pursue the "digital transformation" of the sports article manufacturer with strategic investments, thus expanding its competitive advantage. The investors responded to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sports article manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Prohibited Lifelong Stadium for Racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about the football profi Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the association from the capital of Italy has banned a long-standing stadium ban against a fan. The defender of Brazil Jesus was ridiculed by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. "You already know what you should do with such a fan. #NoToracism. Be proud to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old, who has been playing at AS Rome since 2016.
The club reacted on Thursday. He reported on the fan's account with Instagram and the police. Furthermore, the Roma supporters should never visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Rassism is a problem in Italian football. Regularly scandalous Italian fans racist attacks against black players rivaling teams. "We can't have racism in society or in sports. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. You have to identify and throw out of the stadiums," Fifa President Gianni Infantino said on the weekend. The occasion of the expression were racist songs at the first party between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florence last Sunday.
But also around the supporters of Juventus Turin there had been discussions recently. The Italian authorities now have 38 random fans of recordmaster Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them could no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police informed them. For the rest, prohibitions of four to seven years were therefore valid.
The fans are involved in ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of Ultra Fan groups in the area of Juventus. The 12 are proposed, among other things, severe repression, money laundering and private violence. The club had led the investigations with an ad last year.
The Ultra-Integrators are supposed to be behind black-trading tickets after Italian media reports. They would have "militaryly controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and should have urged young employees to come to more affordable maps.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millenials are narcissistic, the generation Z is political - all years are considered with grammatical names. If you look more closely, the awards are filled with contradictions. How well do these labels describe the respective sense of life of young people?
"The Krabs come!" With this call officially launched the opening of the Gucheng-Sea in Gaochun on 21 September, which also opened the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the department for public work of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern exit of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has in ecological terms ideal conditions with a mix of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent waters and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
In the early 1990s, people in Gaochun began to suffer from cancer. In the course of the time, the crab industry has developed into an attractive sector that provided high income and has become an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In the past years, Gaochun has been actively engaged in a large, ecological and scientific development of cancer cancer as well as in technologically supported cancer. And the city has taken care of the promotion of more efficiency in agriculture and the income of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has developed a reform to "distribution of power, optimization of administration and administration services" and with care the service network for "authorisation under a roof, a team for prosecution, a network for services, a platform for credit granting". This aims to optimise the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun creates the benefits of connecting to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Anhui, and uses the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as an external source, to promote intelligent high-end tourism and foreign transport companies of national importance, companies for biomedical and medical technology, for energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sectors, as well as farms for organic farming, which are leading in the "3+2" area. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the construction of a national, all-area tourism and foreign transport facilities of national importance. In addition, the ecological and cultural resources of the region of Gaochun, which are involved in the region of Gaochun, the state of the buildings of tourism, has also been promoted by Gaochun for the purpose of "the tourism and tourism" on behalf of the land of the university.
Conflict between Iran and the United States: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after returning from the UN Assembly, spoke of an alleged offer by the United States of America to abolish sanctions. In contrast to talks with Tehran's leadership, Ruhani explained on his official website.
But US President Donald Trump objected to the Iranian official on Twitter: "I wanted Iran to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the event as follows: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and had insisted that a meeting take place. "And America says I am lifting the sanctions," Ruhani added. The kind of criminal measures to be completed have stood for the debate. "And they have clearly said that we are lifting all sanctions".
However, Ruhani criticised this initiative in an acceptable way. In view of the applicable criminal measures and "the poisoned atmosphere of the maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. The hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear agreement negotiated with Russia and China was that the Islamic Republic should refrain from developing nuclear weapons. As Merkel at the end of the UN Assembly, France President Emmanuel Macron expressed the hope that Ruhani will meet with US President Donald Trump.
Heavy earthquakes near Istanbul - Nearly 200 successors
After the western Turkey has been shot by two earthquakes within a short time, fear of a disaster grows. 34 people have been injured during the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake on the previous day there have been nearly 200 survivors, Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay said on Friday. This increases the worry of a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings have been damaged. The earthquake of strength 5,8 had spread the Marmara region before Istanbul on Thursday and triggered panic in the millions of metropolis. Now the government wants to set up a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, octoy announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been prepared enough for bees, Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imaglolu said. In the city itself, the latent danger is always ignored. Every year poorly built houses are being torn into pieces - among other things must be made by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly explode in Istanbul.
City planners like the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open areas registered in the centre as a refuge site have been built for a long time. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Golcük baby in August the building engineering chamber of Istanbul had warned that estimated a million buildings in Istanbul would not be more land-based.
The epicenter of the baby from Thursday was located in the Marmara sea in front of the district of Silivri and in about seven kilometers deep, as the disaster protection authority Afad reported. A smaller legacy took a few minutes later for even greater panic on the streets.
The Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu shared on Twitter, injured or injured were not reported at first. The statesman TRT showed people who panicked from the houses. Students were brought to the Silivri district for security reasons from the buildings. Some students wept as they were seeing pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea, there is a section of the so-called North-Anatollic disorder that marks the border between the Eurosian and the Anatollic Plate. Turkey is constantly being threatened by earthquakes. One of the most deadly in 1999 was the bee near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of the magnitude of 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten. But when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear. On Thursday, the earthquake hit the west of the country and Istanbul.
Firms design emergency plans, private people have so-called go-bags packed with all the needs standing ready next to the doors, and schools will help children learn how to handle themselves when the earth wakes up. When the next big bet comes, be unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slight damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekram Immaglolu persecuted the developments of Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom). Two minerals from Moscow fell into the Avcilar and Sariyer districts.
Warning to passersby in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users of panic are reporting. Buildings were clouded. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Phone lines were interrupted. It was stronger than Tuesday, a user writes. The head of the Turkish Red Half Moon, Kerem Clinic, warned on Twitter about the consequences. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The date of birth is given according to official data at 13.59 (place time). Only a few minutes after the first birth there was a copy of CNN Turkey, which was given with a force of 4.0 on the right scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 has affected the Turkish Marmara region - it was to be felt to Istanbul. Also its epicenter has been located in the Marmara sea west of the millions metropolis, the disaster protection authority Abad already shared on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that took care of hit lines on this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later it could come to a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will ever get rid of it - and massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy estimates that the Earthquake is now a warning. It has become more likely, he said to CNN Turk. "These may be the signs of a larger Earthquake," says Ersoy to the sender. "Before or after that, the great quake will also come".
Just a few weeks ago, there had been an emergency - the bee also caused great anxiety in Istanbul. In Albania there had been only a few days ago a severe earthquake - there were 68 injured. Even at the bottom sea this year, the land had been buried.
Parliament: New Firearms in Ukraine
Two missing documents provide new firearms in Ukraine for the possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible procedure, the US Democrats are strengthened: the complaint about Trump submitted by an anonymous notifier and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian President raises important points for investigations against the President. Trump himself sees himself as a victim of a "Hexenjagd". He also doubted the credibility of the Whistleblower.
USA: Airports from United Airlines locked in toilet - Flights routed
Since a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a United Airlines flight was conducted. The toilet door was blocked during the flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline reported to US media.
In an off-planning interim landing at midnight (place time) in Denver, the woman was finally able to be released from the narrow cabin. For about an hour she had been locked in there, US media wrote calling on other passengers. To continue her flight towards San Francisco, the passengers had to change the machine.
In a video distributed on the Internet, which is supposed to come from flight 1554, it is to see how several people are trying to free the woman. "We are working at the moment to open the door, Ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says one man. The airline apologized to all the passengers. It was open first whether the woman was getting compensation.
The Kakerlake: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is undetectable.
Ian McEwan (71) was inspired by Franz Kafkas' famous story "The Transformation" by British success author Ian McEwan, who wrote a book about Brexit chaos in Britain.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (original: "The Cockroach") will appear in German on November 27th, the Diogenes Verlag (Zürich) announced. This is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but now on one occasion is the most powerful man in the United Kingdom. He sees it as his mission to implement the will of the people in fact and is willing to let nothing and no one stop.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "If Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, if the minister is as shy as ever the Soviet leader, if Brexiters in high positions are to bring about the disaster of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer: write." From McEwan was only published in the spring of the novel "machines like me" about artificial intelligence.
Kafkas 1915's first published story is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "as an unforgivable stranger" and is excluded from family and society, and finally goes on. "Ian McEwan refuses to describe a world that stands in the head," said Diogenes.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austrian railway infrastructure
11.200 wagons in Austria and Hungary receive fluorescent brakes to reduce the noise load by freight trains. Furthermore, sections of the railway connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernised and electrified.
According to the EU authority, this should make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU infrastructure top "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All travels down to October 31st
The German travel agent Thomas Cook cancelled all travels one day after his insolvency request until 31 October 2019. Travel could be "not affected for insolvency reasons", the company said on Thursday night.
This includes bookings made by Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travels, ÖGER TOURS, Bookers Travels and Air Marin, which are already paid or paid in full. As it stands for travel starting on November 1, 2019, the company opened. In accordance with the insolvency insurance, the other procedures will be examined.
Thomas Cook, in Germany, had arrived in the courtyard of the British parent company and had applied for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, including Neckermann Travels, Öger Tours and Booker Travels, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Safer wants to transfer hotels from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad, which are still hosting Thomas Cook holiday, will receive money from Zurich insurance. According to Zurich, the payments to the hotels are linked to the condition that vacationers are no longer required to extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without any particular invoices, the hotels in the resorts should now receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich speaker of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and subject to the condition that Thomas-Cook travelers from these hotels are not required from now on for individual payment of hotel bills or otherwise," said Bernd Engelien.
As a result, the insurance responded to reports of hotel guests who were forced to pay their own accommodation on site. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centers had severely criticised this.
As many hotels are affected, it will be agreed on Friday with the insolvent travel provider, said the insurance speaker. According to Thursday, 70 000 Thomas-Cook vacationers were still traveling from Germany. Zurich Germany has secured the vacation and return of Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue three Thomas Cook societies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the payments now announced to hotels by Zurich Insurance only help travellers who are still on their way. For Thomas-Cook customers who want to fly the holiday only, it seems bad. On the late Thursday evening, the company shared all travels until 31 October. This applies also to such bookings that are already paid.
As it stands for travel starting on November 1, 2019, the company opened. In accordance with the insolvency insurance, the other procedures will be examined, it said. In principle, insurance Zrich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurance company Zrich, which can be represented by Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of refunding the travel price and apply a web form to their claims.
Prince Harry destroyed Springmine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry continues Lady Diana's commitment. In Africa he is now turning directly to his mother's trails.
The British Prince Harry in Angola, dressed in a blue segregation vest, has burned and destroyed a explosives mine.
Near a British Halo Trust camp near Dirico, he set up the ignition circuit on Friday morning before the TV camera running. In a safe distance, the bombers exploded in the savannah landscape without causing damage. Although the Halo Trust alone destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decade-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 mines that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African journey, Harry wanted to walk directly to the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. With the same bomb master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to take back the path she was going to. The pictures on which Princess Diana 1997 went through a spacious mine field had gone around the world. She had also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African trip since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis Cape Town.
Breaking Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated that he would not be guaranteed a third suspension of the Brexit negotiations. But what statements in the polarising British have been made for a long time. The latest judgment of the Supreme Court in Great Britain floats like a damokle sword over the Blondschopf. His suspension of Parliament in order to be able to carry out its Brexit course until the date of retirement was cancelled at the beginning of this week. And a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to carry out an extension of bilateral negotiations with the EU until 31 October. However, Johnson has categorically again excluded it.
Boris Johnson still holds a deal for possible
However, the pressure does not seem to pass on to Johnson. Meanwhile, when visiting a hospital, he indicated that he would support an extension of the negotiations in the event of a disagreement by the end of October:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best of all, with a deal, I'm cautiously optimistic that it works.
And the time of the Brexit negotiators in Brussels is running out of time. About six weeks later, the EU and British retailers have time to prevent a British withdrawal from the European Union without agreements. However, the recent talks have not yet reached a breakthrough. An agreement by the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a new shift of the date of withdrawal is in force. The opposition does not support the Prime Minister's words. You fear that Johnson might somehow implement the Brexit in case of a no-deal.
US authorities: Other deaths by e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has increased to twelve. In addition, there are confirmed and probable injuries in 805 in this context, the US health authority informed CDC. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, more than 900 people have already been affected, about 500 of whom have been confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still unclear. In Europe there is no similar increase in lung damage.
Fear of new protests in Egypt grows
The videos by Mohammed Ali have been distributed millions of times in online networks. The construction contractor and actress living in Spain calls for a "Volksrevolution". For this Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, whose critical corruption and mismanagement are causing. Ali hopes for mass announcements with a million participants in central places of the country.
The security authorities are alarmed anyway. In the center of Cairo there was already an enhanced police presence. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were blocked. In the past days the police had already reinforced their street controls and partially searched the phones of pedestrians for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20 the demonstrators gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend it was in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura to protest with hundreds of participants. There was no such open protest in Egypt for years. The security forces responded accordingly. According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW) Human Rights Organization (HRW), many of them were arrested almost 2,000 people since last week. Many of them were voluntarily arrested - only because they were "for the wrong time in the wrong place", HRW informed them, calling on legal lawyers.
The organization also criticised the censorship in the North African country. Therefore, the government is blocking Cairo websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The General has ruled the country since 2013, after he had silenced the democratically elected Islamic President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been arrested and partially convicted in the past years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs von Greenland-Expedition back
The Polarforscher Arved Fuchs returned on Friday from his Greenland expedition. He was welcomed at his arrival in Hamburg port, among other things by Skipper Boris Herrmann, climate activist Greta Thunberg with the racing "Malicia" over the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had investigated and documented the effects of global warming on his ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future Movement was a blessing, said the Polar Researcher. For years he waited for the young generation to report to the word. For decades he knew that the earth would warm up. However, many acted as if there was a planet B.
"What's going on on the sea often happens under public exclusion," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the drowning of the seas. In the expedition, among other things, it was measured with a dry green glacier trail and fished with nets after microplastics.
For its "fighting for the sustainable and respectful use of the world's seas", the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" during the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us whose survival of the oceans lies in the heart, Arved Fuchs is a great example," Skipper Boris Herrmann said at the award ceremony. "He is a witness of the changes that have contributed to the Arctic in recent decades."
Teure Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid for noodles 430 Euros
430 Euros for two teller spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the English castle in Rome: That seemed too much to two Japanese tourists. The bill included 80 Euros of drinking money was paid by the two women, but they posted the departure on Facebook, which triggered hot reactions.
"Such cases harm the sight of Rome. We ask the police to examine whether this is a fraud," asked a speaker from Federgit, the Association of Travellers in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday Edition).
Prompt came the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese women had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified themselves. However, this is not to be taken from the bill. Also, a drink of up to 20 percent of the bill was normal, the host said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could actually be confronted with an official collection procedure after the turbulent discoveries of the past days, which the Democrats want to check as soon as possible with their investigation in the House of Representatives - the speech is from weeks to a decision.
At the beginning of the scandal, the phone call with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj is likely to be made. The proposal of the Whistleblower, who has taken care of the discussion about national security and about the democracy of the United States with his last complaint, is monster: the President has misused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the 2020 election. He has used Ukraine's dependence on it and so they want to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be reflected in the currently published signature of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reproduce the full word. But the phone call of July 25 is only an episode of a much larger story, in which the centre next to Trump is primarily his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story is taken from the public's perspective in May 2019 when the New York Times of Rudy Giuliani's travel plans are reported to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected President Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are good. "We do not mix in an election, we join in an investigation where we have the right," he says the newspaper. He might think it was inappropriate, but "that is not illegal". Giuliani wants to be followed in Ukraine by investigations for which there is hardly a basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful to my clients and could be an aid to my government."
The lawyer and former New York mayor seem to have been infected with right-wing fantasies that were fixed on Trump's opponent at the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had co-operated with actors in Ukraine, critics said at that time to construct an occasion for Russia's submissions in the United States. However, this suggestion was never taken seriously.
It is precisely the findings that will be discussed in July on the phone with Selenskyj. The version of Gillianis and the President states: The former Vice-President and now ambitious candidate for the presidential candidacy of the Democrats, Joe Biden, has been forced as Ukraine's agent of the Obama government to disband the former Ukrainian Attorney General, Viktor Schokin, and in order to stop the investigation of the gas company responsible for him, his son Hunter Biden was active in his supervisory board. Both seniors have financialized Ukraine to neglect the corrupt capacities of his family.
In fact, the outcome was somewhat different. When Joe Biden asked the Ukrainian Attorney General to go, the investigations against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected. Shockin was himself subjected to extremely corrupt charges, the US government was not the only Western partner at the time who forced his release. In the other hand, Obama’s government explicitly supported the investigations against the company.
Disorders at Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disturbances on Instagram and Facebook. Thus, especially Germany, Britain and Spain are affected. On the site all disorders.de reports users that Facebook has not been loading since around 3.30 p.m. Also Instagram reports the error message that content could not be loaded. Also whatsapp seems to be affected by the disturbance, even if not so far.
Instagram and co. frequently affected by disturbances
It is not the first massive crash this year. Already in March and July the services were lost for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users also go back to Twitter this time in particular to make their angry air.
Polish Scientists Saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued from the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were on their way with a hose boat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They had luck in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue rifle for the robbery.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Force:
"At 9:30 a.m. we received the message, about ten minutes ago we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the boat."
Poland has been operating on King George Island since 1977, the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station, 19 scientists are working there. The frozen researchers have certainly been brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NO cordless charging
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
As recently as several new smartphones have come to the market that support wireless uploads and sell very well - all in front of the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to call again a study from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature sets battery to
Researchers warn against the wireless charge of smartphones. This is according to the University of Warwick's findings, which is extremely harmful to the devices. The reason for this is the significantly larger heat development. If you load a normal cell per cable, the battery heats up in three hours at 27 degrees. In the case of cordless charging, the researchers have measured the smartphone on the charging path even more than 30 degrees. If the phone is slightly beside the coil, the temperature is even higher. Also, the water volume of the charging path increases, which in turn drives the power consumption up.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of battery is a crucial factor. As each grade plays a role. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery not only needs capacity, but also does it not last for so long. The lifetime of the battery is so low. The researchers therefore advise that the smartphone is always charging per cable. Since a battery is always connected to modern smartphones at high costs, it should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently even increased the cost of an battery even once more - and for all iPhones.
Practical
The technique is extremely convenient: Easy to put the device on a suitable charging path - they are already already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without a broken cable salad and a difficult plugging female. Since Qi (which is used for inductive energy transmission) has a global standard, with exception even Apple, there are few restrictions. However, the technology should be used only in exceptional cases according to researchers.
Everest-Stau-photograph: 13 Eight thousand in six months
An Nepali mountain climber has reached 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world, according to his own data. Nirmal Purja (36) reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus set up a record, his expedition organizer shared with him.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 thousand people in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international battle lines: From him comes a photo of mountain climbers who stand on Mount Everest snakes in the spring.
The image of the mass campaign triggered a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848 meters high mountain and the highest peaks of the earth. Within less days, eleven climbers died in May.
A problem for Purja could be the rise of the 14th thousandth: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. For this reason, among other things, is called bad weather. At the beginning of the week Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wants to talk to China to allow it to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered on Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a portable elephant cow, a police spokesman told us on Friday. "We suspect the elephants were poisoned."
The four cadres were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists earlier rock festival Sigiriya. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years of age. An autopsy was arranged to determine the cause of death.
On Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed each year. The killers are often farmers, where the animals had previously been unharmed. At the same time, about 50 people are killed each year by elephants. This is usually the case when the animals move near their habitat.
According to estimates, only about 7,000 elephants live in Sri Lanka. Their killing is theoretically the death penalty.
Permanent British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its establishment by Iran. According to the IRNA news agency, this was announced by the Bandar Abbas Seafarts Office. The Iranian revolutional gardens had set the tanker running under the British flag on July 19th under the pretext to disregard the rules of the sea law in the Persian Gulf.
Thomas Cook's Management in Criticism
The competent Economic Committee of the Sub-House wants to examine the Board of Traveller Thomas Cook in detail. It is also intended to deal with the budget packages of the Board as well as with the question why the British government did not want to move financially to the companies that are struggling to survive. "Our interest in the company is as much as in the supervision of external auditors," said the committee president Rachel Reeves in London. "We obviously have to do it with a bad example of management."
According to experts, genes are overestimated at the risk of colon cancer
The role of genes in the increased family risk of colon cancer has been apparently overestimated so far. To this end, researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg come into a current study. Other risk factors such as family eating habits are therefore likely to weigh heavier than ever. This has had consequences for calculations of individual colon cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists stress.
Elon Musk lets Tesla shares rise
This was written by Musk in an e-mail published on Thursday (place time) by the industry blog "Electrec" to Tesla employees. The request was strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it is called in Musks Rundschrifben.
The challenge was to quickly get the cars to know. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
The investors felt the information: Tesla shares went with a plus of over six percent of the trade. So strong the course has not been added for nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95'000 cars and thus achieved its previous best value.
Musk needs a record in order to achieve its high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers have to be made in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are few gains. Despite the boom, there have been losses.
Will the British government implement Brexit law? Johnson withholding
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he is looking for an unregulated Brexit after possible transposition of Parliament's last law. He said only on Friday in front of journalists that his government will remain in force.
The law provides that the government must apply for a transfer of the expiry date, should not have reached an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law", which makes it difficult to negotiate with the EU.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed the suspicion on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political shifts" to enforce the law. Johnson could use a procedure that shifts the law into time after the EU's withdrawal.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement".
Iran conducts apparently high uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has raised the pressure on the European Contracting Parties in the fight against the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. "The European States have shown incapacity or lack of readiness when it comes to concrete actions," Rohani said on Thursday at a press conference on the edge of the UN Assembly in New York. In the case they are not on their promises, he presented "more steps" away from the agreements of the difficultly negotiated agreement of 2015.
The conflict is a background to the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which, as a counter-performance, included the commitment to normalise economic relations. In 2018, the United States came out of the agreement in 2018 to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to change its course into an aggressive neighbourhood policy. The government of President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher orders and, in the meantime, to bring about severe sanctions against Tehran. Iran has recently reacted to this with a resumption of the limited uranium enrichment in the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic now uses or prepares for use by Uranium in early September. According to the IAEA data, Iran is also preparing for the construction of more than 300 additional centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans were not prepared to carry their share of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the cost and burden of pressing US sanctions, Rohani had to. However, there will be further talks that hopefully provide a solution.
Rohani continues to dispute Iran's development in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the community changed: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed on Monday the US estimate that Tehran was responsible for the attack. The Huthi rebels who were supported by Iran originally became known in Yemen as the attack, which was considered a false confession by the United States. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who raise such charges must present evidence for this," Rohani said. The European leaders in the talks with him during the UN General debate were not able to do so. Instead, they would have relied only on the rebels in Yemen to carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the past days.
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump, the extensive sanctions of the US administration had to be lifted, Rohani demanded. He urged the government in Washington to move to a policy of "dialogue and understanding".
Comet of Other Star Crossed Solar System
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the universe. This came first. The comet allows feedbacks to other solar systems.
What was initially only a suspicion is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was baptized after its discovery on 2I/Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers all over the world.
The widely traveled comet was discovered on August 30 by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Observations of various observatories confirmed not only that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it was not from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object after 1I/'Ouumamua of 2017, which was seen during a journey of our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get insights into a strange solar system before it disappears into any vision. The first observations show that the interstellar comet resembles our own system, as reported by the Canadian astrophysics Institute. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which in this distance is clearly above the typical speeds of objects surrounding the sun," said David Farnocchia of the U.S. Space Agency NASA in a communication.
The comet is based on the analysis of a so-called hyperbele train that takes it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as reported by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It is also responsible for the designation and categorisation of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar swimmer, which was first led under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, was named 2I/Borisov, indicating that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
Astronomers are lucky: in contrast to 1I/'Ouumamua 2I/Borisov was already seen in the flight. Thus the researchers remain for many months for research. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium telescopes by April 2020," said Farnocchia. "Then it will only be observed with larger professional telescopes by October 2020".
Several observatories have already taken the visitors into the viewer. Thus a team of Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Ouumamua, identified in a first study the diameter of the sky object at 2 to 16 kilometres. Recordings of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a significant wave of comet.
Researchers and researchers at the Astrophysic Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar weaving star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets of our solar system, and indicates that its composition must be similar," said IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation is very close to the fact that comets in other solar systems could be formed through similar processes as in ours, complemented by Leon's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of the same two interstellar visitors within only two years after the IAU estimate indicates that these objects could open up a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, as often as such spot visits are, it is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly capture a planned satellite mission of the European Space Day Esa.
By 2028, the agency intends to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" on a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometres away from the earth. It is intended to be based either on an unaffected, fresh comets from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Ouumaua, according to the Director of Science Günther Hasinger.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega Airport Daxing
At the moment before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic it is so far: On the new mega airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger machine of China United Airlines is landed, a special honor for Captain and Crew.
By 2022, about 45 million passengers were to be finished annually at the new airport, then 72 million in 2025. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China's latest prestigious project is also called "Sistern" because of its six-story building structure.
The complex has four starting and landing routes to be extended to seven later and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new U-way transports passengers in just 20 minutes to the centre of Beijing.
Even during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly left Berlin to learn from Beijing. The opening of the building since 2006 was - and much smaller - the main city airport in Germany has so far been moved. In Beijing, after four years, a first passenger machine was established.
New overcrowding aircraft is due to fly 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - the British Space Agency dreamt of it. It is possible to make this, which is a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre) for the 2030 season, developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, the US broadcaster CNN quoted the agency as saying. "This is the technology that could definitely work," said Graham Turnock to the broadcaster. "We are talking about the 2030s for the deployment, and the work has already been very advanced."
In order to advance the project, the British Space Agency wants to work closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis now takes about 20 hours. As the only passenger passenger airship to date, the Concorde had covered the New York Paris route from 1976 to its start in 2003 and needed three to three and a half hours. In 2000, it was an accident at the start of a concert at the Paris Airport Charles de Gaulle, where all 109 Insanes came to life. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans, together with the US Space Agency NASA, to develop an over-airship aircraft, which is also known as the "X-Plane".
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," says Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient journeys with a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the signal. Furthermore, such aircraft are also usable outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus allow the "next generation of truly reusable reusable ramps".
Alarm in Washington: Trump wants to detect anonymous tippers in Ukraine affair
In Ukraine's case of possible abuse of power by the US president, Donald Trump wants to detect possible unplanned positions in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the Whistleblower the information," Trump said on Thursday in front of U.S. employees in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and with such things in the past "a bit different" than today.
This was evaluated as a fearsome attempt against tippers. The event was not actually public. Several U.S. media distributed audio media from the address on Friday. Democrats responded to the president's statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House had announced preparations for an official procedure against Trump on Tuesday. Their proposals were based primarily on the written complaint of an anonymous secret service officer, who raised serious charges against Trump and its government headquarters. On high public pressure, the complainant’s pictures were made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wants to receive information from several government employees, which the US President "uses the power of his office" to ensure that another country joins in the US election of 2020.
A controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his officials to investigate which could harm his political rival Joe Biden. It is about protecting his spree against Ukrainian justice in the past business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his race against Ukrainian justice. Biden is in the race for the democratic presidential candidacy for the 2020 election.
The Whistleblower also accused the White House with a view to Ukraine's telephone: leading government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the cover. As usual, an electronic word protocol has been produced. This was done after the interview to instruct lawyers from the White House but was removed from a database that was usually provided for, instead of being stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough conversation protocol has been published.
The identity of the notifier is not public. The "New York Times" reported that it should be an employee of the CIA's foreign secret service.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of Tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the so-called Whistleblower had distributed information from a second hand that had been unresolved. Therefore, there may be no tipper or spy.
As Trump expressed himself in New York about those who were supposed to have played with the Whistleblower information, however, he was relieved. The president of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, reacted upset and complained, Trump's statement once again undermines the integrity of the government.
The House of Representatives has been conducting various investigations against Trump and its environment in various committees for months. In view of Ukraine's proposals, the Democrats are now conducting new investigations with a view to setting up a possible anti-Trump collection procedure.
"The Whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation," said the head of the Secret Service Committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Ship. Trump attacked the ship sharply, threw a false representation of the things before him and demanded again the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump taunted the ship regularly and had already demanded his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and foreign policy field, most of which were under democratic but also Republican presidents, followed a statement published on Friday after a study initiated by the Democrats for a possible process of collecting office. If the assumptions were to be maintained, it would be "a gross abuse of power" by Trump, which was mentioned there.
There is no precise timetable for the next procedure. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could try a so-called impeachment procedure. But the decision on a actual collection of office fell in the Senate, where Trump Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no US President has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW Works Council: jobs are "similar" demolished
The plans of the VW brand, in which to further reduce the costs of production, could go to the burden of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the company's company. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from ten billion euros to two billion euros by 2023. Of them, 500 million euros should be saved this year.
A key to this is staff costs. The "future pact" negotiated between the company and the company council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Essentially, a job can only be demolished when it is almost proved that the related activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment insurance is applicable until 2029.
However, as our newspaper has now learned from business council events, jobs in production that are not actually at the disposal are "similar" built over another path - so that the official course is passed. Free regular jobs would often not be reoccupied.
In these cases, the Board of Directors has no opportunity to force re-establishment. Meanwhile, there is a lack of staff in many places to take the job closure to increase the concerns of the average exhausting of the vehicles. This also increases the fear that vehicle production could be withdrawn from Germany and Europe because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. From VW it was just said: "A change in the employment volume is being made as agreed along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to further standardise production worldwide and centrally control new projects. This will also reduce costs and also accelerate decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and thus increase competitiveness. Production CEO Andreas Tostmann said at a Berlin Manager's conference: "Just in uncertain times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the US and China, we are well advised to make ourselves a crisis party."
In this way there is already success: For example, this year, for the first time since 2013, production costs per vehicle will fall compared to the previous year. Before journalists, Tostmann said that the production time for the Gulf 8 to be presented in Wolfsburg is about 1.1 hours short. Exact figures for production duration do not mention VW, according to our newspaper it is around the Gulf 7
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg family plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The works Braunschweig and Salzgitter make components. For Wolfsburg, VW-intern applies the rule that 800,000 cars must be built there annually in order to make the work profitable. In 2018, however, the release in Wolfsburg was only about 700,000 vehicles - due to the declining diesel demand and the problems in converting to the new consumption and exhaust test procedure WLTP.
As Tostmann’s production manager announced last year, however, in Wolfsburg, a million cars are expected to roll from the band. This will allow the binding of golf production in the stockwork - because the Zwickau works by refurbishing to the location for the E-Auto production.
In Wolfsburg, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (seat) are also produced. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently decreased. Therefore, the expectations now rest on the Gulf 8. It is expected to remain the bread and butter car of the Wolfsburgs first, despite all efforts to build the e-mobility.
forced by voodoo to prostitution: human dealer convicted
Young women from Nigeria are armed with swords, locked in the area of silence and forced to prostitution. Six courageous human dealers have to go to prison for this.
Six conscientious human dealers from Nigeria were sentenced on Friday to bailing and imprisonment for up to eight years and three months. The accused had imprisoned young women from Nigeria and forced them to prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the traveling Nigerians still had to lay a ritual burden in their home in front of a voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years of age. They were brought by Libyan castles in canoes over the Mediterranean. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. They arrived in Germany, they were distributed on different boards to cover the alleged lock costs of an average of 25 000 euros. Therefore, their salary was completely cut off.
The accused - four men and two women - had added the inclusion and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerians to Bordelle in the process. "The work made the women physically and mentally difficult," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann in the announcement of judgment. "Some were rightly directed."
The rulings are based on commercial and gang-related inclusion of foreigners, human trafficking, asylum and heavy forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm Dauerweit with the Lufthansa Group has again threatened Ufo with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union "will inform on 14 October about the labour struggles in the LH Group", said Ufo Tariff Manager Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have denied it for months to conduct tariff negotiations with Ufo. It is also a question of whether the trade union has legally announced tariff agreements with Lufthansa.
At this point, Ufo is now strengthened following a decision by the Labour Court of Frankfurt. Lufthansa wanted to make it clear that the tariff agreements were not announced. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined the remedy. "What a second court sees the matter completely different, I consider it unlikely," said Ufo's Board of Directorsflohr.
In August Lufthansa also submitted an application to the Frankfurt State Labour Court to examine the status of the Ufo as a trade union. The company argued that the trade union had not been appointed by a representative board for months and thus could not fulfill its role as a tariff partner.
Previously, there was a fierce leadership dispute in the division union, in which many members of the board and of the council have retreated, including the long-standing union chief Nicole Baublies. The Ufo had suffered an already-initiated riot vote on the strike of the cabin staff at Eurowing's end in July, due to doubts about its leadership.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new Visa System
So far, Saudi Arabia was not exactly known as an international tourist magnet. But this should change now. The country in the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new Visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract international tourists in the future. By 2030 the number of international and domestic visitors increased to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission reported.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said Ahmad Al-Chatib, chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia is still difficult for tourists. Visaverden is usually only available for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors to the desert state. With the new rules, the Erzconservative Kingdom expects more revenue from the tourism business. Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones met two of the main oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Chourais oil field. Following this, the national oil production broke dramatically, the oil price shots to the height. It should take several weeks until the oil production of the Kingdom reaches its old level again.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in preparation for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for her wedding party. The model posted several party photos in their Instagram stories, on which she is to be seen in the white wedding look. Reality Star Kendall Jenner (23) and others, according to the People's Magazine, had organized a youth in Los Angeles.
Justin posted several colored, inter alia, banana-printed costumes on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me choose my smoking for the wedding". According to media reports, the promi couple wants to marry church in the coming weekend.
The beekeepers gave the word yes a year ago in a New York stand room, and there was no greater party at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that the two had found a common level after initial problems: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship".
Two deaths in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small plane in western Czech Republic. The Wrack was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Meschin, the police informed him. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday night after the operation via GPS. The search was also a military helicopter in use. The cause of the accident still needs to be identified. The crash is about 30 kilometres south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometres north-east of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are threatened by extinction
In addition to harming people, diseases, alien species, non-sustainable timber strike, and the growth of cities caused by the threat, the IUCN World Conservation Union reported on Friday in Brussels. It investigated the stocks of 454 species known in Europe. 265 of them do not occur on any other continent. Of these 265 were 58 percent threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of danger and thus are facing extinction.
The IUCN shares endangered species in six categories: from "potentially endangered" via "dangered", "strongly endangered", "dangered by extinction" and "destroyed in nature" to "dead". Overall, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide as endangered.
Ebersche and wild Rosskastanie threatened
In Germany, Eberschen (Sorbus) was particularly threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are so small or by the conversion or weakening of their living spaces".
Bad is also the case for the wild ordinary Russians. They have been considered "hazardous" since 2017, stage two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat is the Balkan mini-method. It has spread over the whole continent since the 1980s from Southeast Europe and has hardly natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild Russians (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to fewer than 10,000 specimens. This assessment does not take into account the trees in cities, parks and islands.
Strawcharts and Moose also in danger
At the same time, IUCN scientists created new European red lists for weights, scurvys and mooses. More than one-fifth of weights and mooses and almost half of all rain charts are at risk, as the IUCN states. This is especially true of the destruction of wildlife, including species, agricultural practices and climate change. Weights like snow played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many species that are overlooked and underestimated, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, the IUCN Director of the European Office. "We need to limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and to prioritise the protection of these species."
Earthquakes in front of Istanbul: 34 reported
During the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured. There were no deaths according to the data. dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have been damaged. Since the earthquake on the previous day, there have been nearly 200 survivors. The earthquake of the strength of 5.8 on Thursday had devastated the Marmara region from Istanbul and triggered panic in the millions of metropolis.
Now the government wants to set up a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. Over the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imaglolu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea, there is a section of the so-called North-Anaholic Disorder that marks the boundary between the Euroasian and the Anaholic Plate.
One of the hardest bees was one of the 7,6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölcük in southeast Istanbul. More than 17,000 people died.
Already on Tuesday, the area of Istanbul had been hit by an earthquake of 4.6. The authorities called on the residents to keep damaged buildings away.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira will be at the semi-time show
The Latin pop singer Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will introduce the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl. This was announced by the singers on Twitter. "It won't be bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She was crazy to stand on the Super Bowl stage. On 2 February 2020 it will be so far in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had dreamed of appearing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - at that time she saw Diana Ross flying at the half-time show in the sky. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I'm going to perform with another Latina". She could hardly expect to "show what we can do on the biggest stage of the world".
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she felt honored to stand next to another artist on one of the biggest stage in the world and represent Latinos and Latinas from the United States and the whole world. "And then also on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter, it was the first time that the two "kings" were on a stage together.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents came from Puerto Rico.
Fight against falling viewers
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and half-time show are among the most popular TV broadcasts in the United States. Even if you have recently lost viewers: in this February the spectacle in the United States struck the smallest viewer for more than ten years. However, it was still almost 100 million people on average.
About the half-time show of the past Super Bowl there had been an alarm in the front: In the fight to deal with quarterback Colin Kaepernick in the past February media reports according to Topstars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not appear. Finally, Pop Group Maroon 5 launched the half-time show - the critics were not friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of San Francisco 49ers, went to the knees in 2016/17 before NFL games at the National Hymne of Protest Against Police Violence and Rassism. With his protest, Kaepernick dissolved a movement, many players took over the gesture. This made it very exciting, US President Donald Trump attacked most African football stars. Kaepernick himself has been unconcerned since March 2017 and has no NFL party anymore. He rejects the associations not to celebrate him for political reasons.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are expected to be expensive in the opinion of the travel provider Thomas Cook. High subscriptions to outstanding bonds and loans are threatened. Credit Suisse is also affected by this, says the "Financial Times" in its release on Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or the Credit Suisse had to make a total write-down of up to 1.8 billion British pounds (about EUR 2 billion) on their books, according to the report.
The creditors of bonds were required to purchase write-offs of 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the creditors between 550 and 825 million pounds. In fact, the amounts to be written should be at the top end of the band, an expert said to the sheet.
As the losses of the creditors will eventually prove, after the insolvency proceedings have ended. A person near this procedure did not offer too much hope. For example, the around 40 Thomas Cook aircraft in Great Britain are "old" and many of the properties are in bad positions. Most of the money could probably be obtained by selling the airport slots as well as the Thomas Cook brand, it continued.
Rackets are supposed to have brought massive killers to Italy
The Sea Watch captain, Carola Rockette, may have brought men to Italy who have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We can't exclude this, but we don't even have certain information about it," said the spokesperson of the Refugee Organisation Sea Watch, Ruben Neubauer, the News Agency dpa.
Other migrants had once again recognized the three men in Italy. You are asked to have raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The necessary perpetrators were arrested in the recording camp in the Italian Messina. New building stressed that the refugee organisations could not check who they left on their ships. "They come without passports."
Carola Rockets had illegally brought migrants into the port of Lampedusa on June 29 and saved a ship of the Italian Finance Police. On that day the three suspects were also to arrive there. The Captains are investigating for illegal immigration.
US warns federal government against Huawei
The head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, warned the federal government to trust the Chinese network equipment Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too high," said Pai to the "trade sheet" with a view to the development of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law", which each company "under Chinese law" committed to comply with the instructions of the security authorities.
The applicable law also prohibits the company from informing third parties about such requests," said the FCC Chief. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the Federal Government has agreed to demand a "confidentiality statement" from suppliers.
Berlin wants to first try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "handelsblatt" calling for its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not consist only of hardware:
Just the software is important to keep the devices up-to-date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," Pai said.
It is "very difficult to imagine", that a government authority, "no matter where it might be able to check each update in real time to detect security risks," said the FCC Chief.
The Chinese group Huawei offers close contacts to the Chinese state apparatus:
The property conditions are impartial. The employee company, allegedly owned by the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai said to the "trade sheet".
The United States submits findings that government employees are placed within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to advertise the position of the United States.
Chemical factory in Northern France Burns: Schools Closed
In the night, residents hear explosions. A giant fire wall lights the sky over a North French chemical factory. The fire is destroyed after hours - the cleaning work could take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and children's skulls remain closed in the region.
In 12 municipalities the facilities would not be opened carefully on Friday, the competent prefecture informed. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to stop smoking. There were no injuries. Farmers and farmers were called to bring their animals inside to protect their feed and to set up the harvest first.
The fire could be completely removed on Thursday evening, as the prefecture reported. There is still the risk that after the destruction smell spreads, so the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 policemen and gangsters were in use at the Brandort.
A giant black smoke column was previously set up from the chemical factory. French media reported huge fires and explosions in Lubrizol’s factory, which produces oil supplements. The production plant is a few kilometres away from the city centre.
The factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Severso category of dangerous locations that are especially monitored. In the Italian Severso near Milan, there was a devastating chemical accident in 1976.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the messenger BFMTV that there was first no "high toxicity" detected in samples. However, a pollution of the nearby region could not be excluded. In the river, the dust barrier was built against pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out early in the morning at 2:40 p.m., the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located at the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Minister of Finance: "Germany needs to invest and now"
The French Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Bruno Le Maire, has called on Germany to invest more in order to boost economic growth in the euro area.
Germany needs to invest and now, the sooner the better," Le Maire said on Thursday evening when presenting the French budget for the next year.
The euro area economy is weakening, the Minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation deteriorates in order to make the necessary decisions".
The action would have to be taken by those countries which had more investment in the budget, Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France did not have these playgrounds, added the Minister and referred to the high government debt of his country. It is more than 98 percent of gross domestic product. French government debt had to be "stabilized" and "reduced", said Le Maire.
In recent years, more and more calls have come from France to Germany to make more public investments to revive the European economy. In contrast, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to overcome its budget deficit.
The French budget presented on Thursday for 2020 provides tax reliefs of more than nine billion euros for households.
This is how the French government reacts, among other things, to the protests of the Gelbwest movement. The new debt should fall to 2.2 percent, as expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson softens question about Brexit tactics
The British Prime Minister Johnson criticises the strict "Capitulation Law" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law tells the British prime minister to avoid a chaos brexit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could use another loophole, but to this effect, the Tory politicians hesitated.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he wants to implement an irregular Brexit - despite the last law adopted by Parliament, which is to prevent it.
The law stipulates that the government must apply for a transfer of the expiry date, should not reach an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law", which makes it difficult to negotiate with the EU.
On Thursday, British Prime Minister John Major expressed his suspicion that Johnson could attempt to use "political shifts" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedure that shifts the law into time after the EU's withdrawal. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement".
Johnson's Chief Adviser Dominic Cummings, however, explained that he felt the political disagreements about Brexit as "walking in the park" and expressed confidence that the EU's ambitious exit would still come: "We will enjoy what we will gain, we will (e.g. Red: from the EU), no concern," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" in a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" in the course of the 2016 election, now acts as a leader in the British Government's Downing Street. He is going to be behind the uncompromising policy that has led the prime minister to a rather unparalleled situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamorous. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) dives deeply into the entire private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her in 1998 from 1969 to Linda's death, was apparently proud and touched when he presented the film band "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison, and Pretenders-Front Frau Chrisie Hynde were among the illustrative guests.
After the launch of the event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse of the life of an exceptional family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of LindaMcCartney as an engaged artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film."
At Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found her photograph, the camera was always there. Thousands of polaroids made it, some of which are now published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
There are portraits, still life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his preface. And of course there is still one in the middle: your husband Paul - as you may have never seen him before.
As he dances on his shoulders with his daughter Mary, he calls in the bathroom with a towel on his head, or wears a rough moonboats. Sure, the McCartneys were an exceptional family, but outside the lighthouse on her farm in southern England or Scotland also led a very normal life. Thus said Mary McCartney, according to BBC, that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had built from old potato boxes. And it has not always been cleaned up at McCartneys.
Like hardly any other medium, the Polaraid camera starts the immediate moment. Linda McCartney's recordings are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about the decisive click: you have to find out if a great photo happened before you. And then you have to cut it in the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you cut two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it may be a completely different photo." And Linda had the gift to always capture the right moment. "You just knew that she had it," said Paul in Eshun-Essay.
There the light, the composition, the picture cut and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining image book for Beatles fans, but also in addition to all the anecdotes, is a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes also seem as abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly posted Beatles album "Abbey Road", which appeared just 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, Turkey wants to continue to import oil and gas from the neighbouring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not cancel imports of oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he participated in the UN Assembly.
However, Erdogan added that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil, as some companies had "retired because of the US invasions".
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran in particular on this and in many other matters," said the Turkish President, who repeatedly criticised the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic since its departure from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the United States, Iran is pursuing an atomic programme in secret and does not adhere to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. The tensions in the Gulf region have increased considerably in recent months.
U.S. government wants to restrict the admission of refugees
The U.S. government wants to drastically restrict the admission of refugees. The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on Thursday that the annual ceiling of a new residence programme should be reduced from 30 000 to 18,000 refugees. This corresponds to an average of 40 percent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained that the United States would continue to be committed to supporting refugees. However, the most important task was to protect and serve US citizens.
The US government wants to focus on the inclusion of two groups of refugees: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and thus are in danger, as the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs states. On the other hand, there should be a maximum of 1500 refugees from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
In the 1980 programme, refugees from UN camps are selected from around the world and re-occupied in the United States. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the programme's history. Already the current ceiling of 30,000 is a low value. When US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, the White House left, the figure was almost 85,000.
Help organizations responded to the announced reduction of the upper limit. "This is a very sad day for America," said International Rescue Committee chief David Miliband. The United States would continue to harm its leadership in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump tries to limit immigration to the United States - legally as illegal - strictly. The US government expects its own figures for the coming budget year 350,000 applications for asylum. These figures are separated from the re-occupational program.
Donald Trump - "Getting Near a Spot"
US President Donald Trump has shown signs in the Whistleblower affair of the espionage. Anyone who has given the informant who has given him the abuse of power has given the appropriate hints, "comes close to a peak," said Trump, according to a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York. This is consistent with several U.S. media reports.
Then Trump spoke in front of employees of the American UN mission. When asked about the person who informed the Whistleblower about the controversial events in the White House, he replied: "This is a tip." Then Trump added: "Do you know what we did when we were beaten? Right. The spy and traitor, we were about to deal with this a little differently than we are doing now."
Observers last commented on a possible use of the death penalty. The Democrats had a strong criticism of Trump's statements and offered him a fear of witnesses. It was also an attempt to prevent a congressional inquiry into a possible recruitment procedure against him, the presidents of the Committees for Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Supervisory at the House of Representatives wrote.
The Whistleblower proposes to the President in a complaint now published to have used his office to ask another country to join the U.S. election in 2020. It is, among other things, to launch his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian official Wolodymyr Selensky in the summer: In the conversation, Trump approached him to investigate his possible democratic challenge Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump contests any misbehaviour.
It is still unclear who the Whistleblower is himself and his informants. As the New York Times reports, however, the Whistleblower is to act as an analyst of the CIA's foreign secret service.
Flying boat known: Baby and little children drink in Ägäis
People are always trying to get over the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. Regularly the boats are often very small. When a boat goes down, seven migrants have come to life - including five children.
Before the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed at the bottom of a boat. Among the victims were also a baby and four other children, reported the Greek Coast Guard. Four children, three women and five men could therefore be rescued from the floods by the occupation of a passing ferry.
Among the victims was also to be a locker, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had broken up from Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group of Inouses in the north-east of the island of Chios. Inouses is between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey move to the Greek islands in the East of Aegean, mostly in many small boats. Last year, on this route, according to the United Nations Refugee Relief Agency (UNHCR) 174 people died.
The Who Breaks Concert
A U.S. concert of the rock band The Who found a year's end due to the incompetence of leader Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the Wednesday (place time) in Houston, his voice denied the service. At eight songs, Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should let it as long as it is still running".
Lead-guitarist Pete Townsend asked for an apology and added, Daltrey could "not really talk right now". The audience promised Townsend to come at a reconstruction concert at his expense.
For Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver scheduled performances, The Who said they should be followed at a later time. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rentals suddenly set: WeWork lets property markets cittern
In New York, WeWork is the largest office owner.
Within a few years, WeWork rises from the small startup to driving power on the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis. Owners must be afraid of billions of revenue.
The crisis of the office tenant WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. The company had set aside Adam Neumann as head of the company a few days ago, moved the planned stock exchange, and started selling subsidiaries and values like the private jet for the executives to win financial space for the coming weeks and months. Also, the British "Financial Times", WeWork has stopped the completion of new leases with immediate effect. Thus, for example, in New York and London, the largest tenants of office premises are suddenly from the market.
WeWork rents large office spaces in the long term and rents them in part of small units to members. This can be individual free-at-homes, small startups or entire departments of large groups. To date, WeWork burns money with this business in stunning speed. Last year, the company introduced a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with sales of 1.8 billion dollars. In this year alone, the rental costs of new large areas will be estimated at 2.5 billion dollars. To limit the loss, the new company management will now pull the emergency brakes and lease new areas with immediate effect.
According to the "Financial Times", WeWork has now concluded leases with periods of up to 15 years, from which commitments of more than 40 billion dollars are made. These huge liabilities could not only become a problem for the company itself and its investors, but for all the real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the past 24 months almost 300,000 square meters of office space. Only WeWorks New Contracts ensured that the demand for offices in New York was larger than the areas that had come into the market at this time. Without WeWorks expansion, the office vacancy in the U.S. metropolis would have increased in this time, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Inside" . Similarly, in London it looks like where WeWork currently operates several dozen offices in a better position.
Even in the UK capital, the balance on the real estate market could move easily without further expansion of the aggressive start-up. Among other things, WeWork is the principal owner, in a office house purchased by the savings fund provider Deca last year for nearly 100 million euros in the centre of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have refurbished their properties for WeWork's requirements with high investment. WeWork works to make its business model profitable soon, the real estate owners had to write off part of the expected billions of revenues. Access to WeWork's - without buttons - reserves do not have them despite long-term rental contracts. Because the rental of WeWork's individual locations is usually carried out by individual additional subsidiaries, called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company only has narrow borders.
Russia again adopted numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In the past days, 262 more wilders were arrested who had illegally fished in the waters, according to the agency Interfax, the Russian domestic secret service FSB reported on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Before the border guards were shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injured persons, it was said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way in Russian high-level waters. There the Russian Coast Guard carries their own data to protect their marine resources Patrols. The new controls revealed 30,000 inkfish. In addition, the data were seized after three fish and two motorboats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok. According to the agency Ria Novosti, the Coast Guard 2018 reported more than 8,000 violations.
The Russian fishing authority had also issued no fishing licences to North Koreans after complaints by domestic entrepreneurs. Thousands of North Korean fishermen have been arrested in 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fisheries companies in the remote Primorje region, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained about high environmental damage by North Korean fishermen. They fished closely synthetic nets prohibited in Russia. These would also bring small creatures out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply disappear in the sea where they needed 200 years to be set up. Also, the ships themselves do not comply with the hygienic and technical rules.
Three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured during the pre-week detentions, according to Moscow, and also a wounded North Korean died as a result of his injuries, according to the FSB. On 17 September, Russian border guards first set up a North Korean boat and then a second one after it opened the fire.
U.S. bounded entry ban against ex-President Castro
The United States has banned the entry bans against former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs has based this on a communication on Thursday with Castro's participation in "grave human rights violations". As Head of the Caribbean Communist Party, he has established a system that would be voluntarily arrested in thousands of Cubans and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As President of the Armed Forces, Fidel Castro, the brother of the deceased revolutionary leader, was also guilty of human rights violations there by supporting Venezuela's President, Nicolas Maduro. "The violation of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," said US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had voiced a ban on the entry of members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, for months, he suffered a bitter struggle between the government and the opposition. The United States has imposed a whole series of sanctions against the Maduros government to force him into the knees and to assist the opposition leader and self-appointed interim president Juan Guaidó.
Cuba is considered one of the most closely related Maduros. The socialist Caribbean island receives Venezuela Oil in exchange for services sent to doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous secret service agents to Venezuela to help the government in suppressing government opponents.
New Climate protests of Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests, thousands of people are trying to get on the road again today for greater climate protection.
At the end of an international climate week, the Fridays for Future is planning again actions and campaigns in dozens of countries around the world. New Zealand and Australia should start with the time shift before the protests move across Europe to North America. There, climate activists Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major campaign in Canada’s Montreal.
How big will the global commitment on this Friday be after record participation of the week is relatively unclear. Thunberg itself was a good thing. "Last Friday has reached over four million people for the climate. This Friday we will do it again!", she wrote on Twitter. So far it has given in the framework of strike week 6383 actions in 170 countries, she added.
A good third of all world-wide demonstrators - around 1.4 million - had participated in the protests in 575 German cities, according to estimates of Fridays for Future. This time a list of the movement has been planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Western England on Sylt, people want to go to the streets for the climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had set himself in front of the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to call on the politicians of his country to make greater use of climate protection. Within a short period of time, the Fridays-for-future movement was created. In the climate protests were mainly attended by students and students, but to an increasing extent also by scientists and other adults.
Together, they call for more respect for policy in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate disasters. In particular, under the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming has to be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg arrived just one month after a two-week transatlantic tour with a high-sea reindeer in New York. She had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional talk to the UN, in which she spoke strongly to the Heads of State and Government of the Earth. In her home in Stockholm, she was addressed on Wednesday for her use for more climate protection of the alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelhood Foundation.
Russia bans smoking on the balcony
The people in Russia are no longer allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This is a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a spokesman of the Ministry of Emergency at Thursday in Moscow, the Tass Agency. The ban is to enter into force on 1 October.
If the cigarette is to be removed from a fire, the penalty will fall higher. It is prohibited for the Ministry to burn candles as well. Also, meat sprays on the balcony are not allowed.
Fight against cybercriminals - detector remove server
In the fight against Internet crime, German investigators have for the first time raised a large server provider for illegal business in the darknet.
A total of 13 actors are suspected of having hosted numerous websites at the Mosel in a former Nato banker in Traben-Trabach, via the internationally active criminals.
This was reported by the General Public Prosecutor in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday night with a large action. The darknet is a protected part of the Internet.
For example, customers of the suspects were to be the operators of the world's second-largest darknet market for drugs, "Wall Street Market", which had destroyed the investigators in the spring. Also the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled by a server in cyberbunker, according to the General Public Prosecutor.
One such host was first raised in Germany, it was called. A webhost provides the infrastructure for an internet presence.
In the case of the access operation with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there have been searches in Germany and neighbouring countries. It has been the result of almost five years of investigations. In the afternoon, the investigators want to know more details.
New global climate protests of Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests, thousands of people are still looking for more climate protection on the streets.
To complete an international climate week, the Fridays for Future movement is taking place again in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a major campaign in Canadian Montreal.
Climate protests Who are actually Thunberg's rearmen?
The sense of justice and courage are high, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoking factories that warm the climate. So amazing that an estimated 16-year-old girl holds the powers of this time to the nose. But what is behind it? Is it an aid preparation or smart marketing of a climate activist? Historical Mastership or manipulative tactics for himself?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg puts the masses in motion and brings young people up for a better climate-friendly world. It is not historically seen for the first time in Europe that a young man creates an assembly of children and young people to win for himself. In 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne had chosen to take up a fairer world. At that time, he also had a share of young people to win for himself and to cross the sea in order to get to the praised country, like Greta Thunberg had recently made his trip to America with a sailing boat.
But is there a shadow page about this? Why do you need a stock named "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR manager on her side. Besides, her mother published a book that has sold itself extensively thanks to the daughter standing in the ramplight. Even well-proved followers of Greta Thunberg were a little upset about the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably also set up by some followers. This is also not unfounded, because the action came in the world's media very well and it flows a lot of money thanks to the impressive action.
Here the spirits are now separated: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially when saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain circles of people work together with stock exchangemakers during the world's rescue action? No matter what position the latter is, a critical and reflective point of view is increasingly important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy is living from different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to also question the fundamental projects of certain trends set.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses our solar system
A strange comet crosses our solar system at the moment.
The suspicions of astronomers have confirmed: A foreign comet crosses at the moment of our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - Long the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star crosses our solar system at the moment. He was baptized after his discoverer 2I/Borisov and is occupied by astronomers around the world.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow on the Crimea. He looked at the sky with a self-built telescope and other observations confirmed his first suspicions. In fact, it is an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. He is only the second of his kind that was seen during the journey.
The great chance for astronomers is now to capture insights into a foreign solar system. Apparently, the comet resembles our own system, as reported by the Astrophysics Institute of the Canary Islands. The comet, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), is clearly more interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbele train that takes it out of our system.
Comet has already been seen before arrival - and can be seen for several months
But before it is so far, astronomers can observe it in depth. Because, unlike his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his approach, which means that he can be investigated for many months from Earth. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium telescopes by April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia from the US Space Agency NASA. "Then it will only be observed with larger professional telescopes until October 2020".
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Ouumamua".
First insights about comet 2I/Borisov awaken hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometres in diameter. At the same time, the celestial bodies seem to be similar to our comets - because as IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the swimming star is similar to ours. This observation is close to the fact that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in ours, complemented by Leon's colleague Javier Licandro.
The observation, however, goes beyond individual knowledge. Two such objects have already been discovered within just two years, allowing under circumstances a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids are constantly occupied by researchers. A giant asteroid just recently passed through the earth and approached it dangerously.
"Absolutely Acquired": Rachel Johnson excited about Brother
To Boris Johnson it will be lonely. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister, with clear words, throws the military language of the prime minister as "untasteful". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Betrug", Treaty": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is still under pressure and is still on hold - at least verbally. At the hour of question in the basement this Wednesday, it came to the massive encouragement of the opposition, and in the meantime other critics have reported themselves to be: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sender Sky News that her brother used words such as capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU-outset should be "hanged, dragged, trimmed, tortured and fed up" . She held this to be highly reprehensible. She did not recognize her brother's version again, said Rachel Johnsons, who had participated in the elections to the EU Parliament for the Anti-Brexit Party "Change UK".
She was particularly concerned that her brother Jo Cox mentioned an EU-friendly subordinate who was murdered a few days before the Easter referendum 2016 by a neo-Nazi. Their thoughts could best be honored by passing through Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the basement. "It is very tasteless to refer to an MP who was murdered by someone who called the 'British first'," said Johnson's sister. The actor was obviously coming from the right-wing camp that felt "through this kind of language". For all those who regretted it, it was very tasteless.
Cox's widower also criticised the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick when Jos Name is used so," he tweeted. The best way to honor her is to be, if you are passionately and determined for that, where you believe - no matter what your views are. But you should never "demonize the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere was created, in the attacks became more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson, younger brother Jo, had laid down his office as State Secretary and his mandate as Tory Deputy. "I had broken up in the past months between loyalty to the family and national interest - it is an unresolved tension," explained Jo Johnson.
Johnson's language was also in the church on sharp criticism. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticise the language that "this country is not worthy of it". In a common statement they declared: "In the past days, the language, both in debates and outside Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez join the Super Bowl
In the year of its 100-year existence, the NFL has a strong sign: In the half-time show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots appear. They promise "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina-Power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the upcoming US Football League NFL. This was announced by the organizers on Thursday (place time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humiliated to represent the Latino community in addition to JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the USA," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, will take place in Miami on 2 February. In the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is a Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl puts two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," said Lopez. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. It promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-olds were born in New York after their parents were expelled from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and is seen in the drama "Houstlers" in the German cinemas since November.
Shakira was known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. Her worldwide breakthrough was created in 2001 with her first two-language album and the single "Whereever, Whereever".
The announcement of half-time guests is expected in the United States each time with excitement. In this year many are also regarded as political gestures. Finally, the country, not least through the immigration policy of President Donald Trump, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sports event and at the same time a giant commercial. Artists such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and Rolling Stones were there for Furore. Usually they look at over 100 million TV viewers at the NFL final, it is also very popular in Germany.
Last year there was political controversy. The reason was the dispute about the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to raise himself from a protest against police violence against black people while playing the national anthem, and for that reason was strongly addressed by US President Donald Trump. From solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians rejected a super-bowl appearance - including Rihanna and Pink. Finally, the rock group Maroon 5 was criticised by many.
One actor and youtuber adds Egyptian ruler: First, Mohamed Ali remains rather abroad.
The two men, who have the influence of whether blood flow back to the streets of Egypt, have spent the past week both abroad. One of the two swirling again at Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. In a week, the former General, who arrested the first freely elected head of state in Egypt, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had believed in political Islam and lost no silver on human rights violations at the Nile - in one week, in which hundreds of people in Egypt were arrested because they had been waiting for it in New York.
This is what the President of the other man is trying to do in the streets. Mohamed Ali, of course, stayed abroad, where he would withdraw from the security forces who would arrest him immediately if he tried to enter Egyptian lands. Last week, the 45-year-old was known as a minority of Egyptians. Today he is the leading voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafes, the living rooms and the test tubes of the country: With his YouTube channel "Mohamed's Secrets", Ali calls on his countrymen to rise against Sisi.
He goes directly to the head of state in a very rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president is fast in luxury and let himself build great new palaces, that is. The military leadership that Sisi supports his rule, Ali puts forward corruption and division. Because in his second career as a construction contractor for 15 years, he did exactly these business, he seems to know exactly what he is talking about - at least the impression of many Egyptians, as the precisely exploding clicks show.
After the first week of Sisy's grip on the power of thousands had been demonstrated against his rule and almost 2000 citizens, including prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, were arrested, Ali called for a "million march" this Friday. That there would be so many people on the streets that it was unlikely. But there were simple smaller protests, such as in Giseh near Cairo and in the town of Luxor. Videos showed protests, whose participants in the social media were suspected of corruption and demanded his departure. During these protests, the police also introduced Trengengas and rubber shots. These videos were initially not independently verified by the police.
From the city of Mansura in the Nildelta, where demonstrators last week banded banners with the President's portrait in pieces, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces created checkpoints in the city and on the highways. In Cairo several subway stations in the city were closed due to "containment work", most roads around the Tahrir Square, the heart of the revolution of 2011, were blocked. And at the Rabaa Square, on which in 2013 supporters of the hardened Muslim brother Mursi were blackmailed, until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure should prevent unsatisfiedness: Sisis the future party wanted to calculate a large holding for the president.
Mohamed Ali introduced these provisions to a change in his tactics: "Our goal must not be the Tahrirplace," said Ali in his video camera in Barcelona. "Let's not get involved with police officers." But as a retreat, it is not to be understood: "All Egypt is the Tahrirplatz".
If the supplier promises too much performance
If the Internet connection appears to be much slower than claimed by the provider, there are various test options.
If an internet contract is concluded, it does not need to be blind to the provider's speed data. Customers can check for themselves how much of it is actually achieved.
Finally, the transmission rates promised above are a component of the contract and should therefore be achieved, the customer central Bayern explains.
If the connection seems to be much slower than the supplier, there are various test options. Thus the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"But the tests of the suppliers are carried out according to specific requirements and are therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated," says the consumer central Bayern on their side.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable period of 14 days for the provider to produce the promised performance.
If this does not work after multiple calls, customers can cancel and, under the circumstances, also claim damages. However, in the case of outstanding success, only the way of complaint will help.
First ranking Republican for investigation
The governor of Vermont spoke for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where this is derived from it is determined by the facts that will be established," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before measures - an impeachment procedure can lead to the removal of the president.
Scott said that he was not surprised by the revelations that Trump repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky in a phone call to investigate interventions by the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
Republishers have so far held back criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair; few have found distasteful. Scott's statements are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned against Trump's policy, for example against the lockdown of environmental regulations and the strengthening of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man stays in MCU: Next Marvel film planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August it was known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would therefore not be part of the "Avenger" University. It was completely unclear how it should go with the films around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives a third final film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". This is what several U.S. media report accordingly. Therefore, the film is expected to start: The film will start in the USA from 16 July 2021.
The magazine "Screenant" quotes Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige as saying: "I am glad that Spidery's path will be continued in the MCU. I and all of the Marvel studios are very pleased that we can work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on his Spidery version. You never know what the future will bring".
But how does it come to the sudden good news? Apparently, Sony Marvel would have submitted an offer. According to industry stores, the Disney group, which also belongs to Marvel, would participate with 30 percent of the revenues of coming Spider-Man films. However, the message is not confirmed.
This is how Duke Meghan and Prince Harry appear at the "Suits" final.
After nine clubs, the series "Suits" in the United States is now at the great finale. In the latter, there were many happy endings and also many Cameo performances. And also to the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who had been involved in the series for many years, had a charming tribute. Note that the following sections include spoolers to the finale.
One way forward: Herzogin Meghan did not return in the final for a last divorce size as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some views once again showed the most interesting scenes with today's Herzogin. So, for example, the moments of the broken and lucky wedding with Mike or how she greets him after his sentence of imprisonment.
But also her true husband, Prince Harry, was mentioned at the "Suits" final, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) straight down the altar in order to marry his engaged Sheila (Rachiel Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a multifaceted remark about this suit. Whether he has actually given up a joke, the accused Harvey wants to know from the bridesmaid only to note in detail: "Louis, you are not the Prince of England."
Eggs: Baby and four other children drink at boatsungsluck
At the center of a refugee boat in the Aegean, a baby and four other children were drunk. In total, seven people died in the accident, as the Greek Coast Guard reported on Friday. Nationalities are still unclear.
The boat fell near the Greek island of Inouses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey now move to the Greek islands in the East of Aegean. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Relief Agency (UNHCR) 174 people died. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the EU Commissioner responsible, he wants to "intellect on how it is about the refugee situation in Turkey," said Seehofer on Friday. Then he wants to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to help with the management.
On Friday, a spokesperson of the EU Commission confirmed the planned voyage of seaports with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, there are still unusual numbers of migrants from Turkey. On Tuesday alone, 654 people moved to the Greek islands, called it from the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Does the Turkish deal still work?
The increased numbers have recently raised doubts as to the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement concluded in 2016, which provides that the EU can return all refugees and migrants illegally arriving on the Greek islands. On the contrary, the EU wanted to take up an Syrian refugee from Turkey for all the Syrian Syrians who were displaced.
However, the processing of asylum applications is only difficult because of the lack of staff on the Greek side. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection of Lesbos, Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, almost 29 400 people are present. The worst is the situation in Lesbos: In a warehouse with capacity for 650 people, there are currently 5200 migrants.
Ever since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016, there have been so many, the state radio reported.
Climate change: heat leads to more heart heart attacks
According to doctors, climate change will test the health system in the future. Climate change is "very safe" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology. Especially the heart-circuit system created high temperatures and high temperatures within a short period of time and resulted in increased heart disease. In particular, people with heart-circuit disorders, elderly people and diabetics were affected.
Green politician has to be responsible for a painful photo panel
The chief of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election struggle - was manipulated for this reason by the beaker?
The Canadian Green Chief holds a multi-way cup in his hand on a photo. But now came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has been undetected for quite a long time - and finally it has happened. The reusable coffee cup with metal straw has never been held by Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens. On the party's website she was on a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo was already published and also distributed to the media - and there the cup was still a faster (Papp) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green boss has to be responsible for the photo panel
The National Post then proposed Manipulation and that the Fake News party produce more crediblely on the subject of "Environmental Protection". And that in the middle of an election for the sub-house election, in which Trudeau is also increasingly difficult because of a climbing scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and began the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a counter-translation of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their president to hide their en route cup".
May showed himself shocked and admired on her blog to have nothing to know about this action. To emphasize this, she just posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in her hand. However, she put it right, be from Bamboo. She always told him. A speaker of the party said it was just going to put the party logo in the picture, and not to miss something. From the photo on the website there is only one more cut.
May writes, it does her grief for the employee who did that. "I don't want to call him a fool, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian, and at the same time she said something about her overcommitted team: "If they like to edit a picture again, then they couldn't do anything with my face, so I look younger?"
The German greens are also exposed because of their use of disposable plastics or because of the airflows in Shitstorms - their images were not photographed, however. So the chief of Bavarian greens, Katharina Schulze, on holiday ice with plastic bottles, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencer wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
Apparently, Jaqueline Ng was assured an upgrade by Mail of Cathay Pacific. But when she asked for it at the check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never fly with Cathay again.
Spontan gets an upgrade for the business class - many of them dream of having a lot of guests. Sometimes they are lucky, and the employees at the check-in offer a change from the economy class for free.
However, this case shows how it should not be done: A self-declared influencer has actively requested the Airline Cathay Pacific to upgrade for free. Follow the Instagram Jaqueline Ng more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she fled from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
On the slope, the Jaqueline employees refused an upgrade, although they had shown a mail in which their Cathay Pacific reportedly presented an upgrade. The letter wanted to have the influence of an airline marketing employee. The airline accused Jaqueline of having faked the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-distance flight. This time the woman was supposed to have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The employees at JFK airport were skeptical: they hated at the center. In fact, the employee, from whom the mail is supposed to have disputed the mail contact with Jaqueline, also confirmed the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
The airlines canceled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 US dollars (about €1.280), she had to buy a new ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company representing consumer interests. Although Catay had reimbursed the price for her original ticket, Jaqueline also claimed the cost of the new ticket.
However, as long as Jaqueline does not submit the mail metadata, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, it remains blocked for future flights. The airline’s business conditions also say that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to meet - and now activates a lawyer.
Oil prices are reported in Yemen on ceasefire.
The oil prices fell by more than one dollar on Friday afternoon. Lastly, a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea Brent 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price for a barrel of the American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) kind fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The program was a report by the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is expected to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had caused five percent of the world's oil production in mid-September. The Huthi rebels associated with Iran in the country of civil war Yemen had advertised the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia makes as the US government is responsible for Iran. A ceasefire would exacerbate the political tension in the region.
If an agreement actually exists, you can focus on growth and demand, said Ole Hansen, head of the Department of Raw Material Strategy at the Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg News Agency.
The oil prices continue to move down the last few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had still cost up to almost 59 dollars, Brent almost 65 dollars.
Finally, Bloomberg, calling on insiders, reported that the repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia after the attack was faster than expected in mid-September. Thus, the production volume again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved again towards the original quantity.
Last but not least, there were several press releases calling on insiders that reported rapid progress by the state oil company Saudi Aramco in repair work. However, raw materials experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently trying to avoid a stock market and negative hit lines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the arrest by Iran and the recently granted release on the way to leave the port. The occupation is now preparing the departure, while the ship is still in anchor, Reederichef Erik Hånell told the Swedish radio on Friday morning in a SMS.
However, the U.S. announced that the enemy of Iran would be sent to Saudi Arabia by missiles and soldiers. The fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the U.S. and the United Kingdom had driven oil prices over the past few weeks to a significant extent.
Anti-Tramp Precipitation Increases
In the area of the possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, protests against the White House have become loud. Several leading government officials have been intensively trying to prevent access to the text of the conversation after a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July. This explained an anonymous notifier. The speaker of the House of Representatives, the Democratic Nancy Pelosi, told the White House explicitly "enforcement". Trump spoke of a "Hexenjagd".
North Korea holds the third summit of Trump and Kim for Question
North Korea has doubted that in the nuclear dispute there will soon be a third summit of power holders Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The sense and prospects of such a meeting were questionable due to the lack of progress in implementing the first summit agreements in Singapore, said senior diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the KCNA Agency.
The United States had not done anything to implement the summit's decisions in the previous year, said the consultant of the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He also criticised increased US sanctions and the joint military leadership of the United States and South Korea. However, he hoped for a "wise" and "mutual" decision of Trump to bring it back to an approach.
Trump had said on Monday he only wanted to know what a third summit meeting with Kim would bring before he could explain it. Negotiations on the disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile programme have been reached in Hanoi since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in February. In June, both met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to resume the consultations, but so far without great success.
Prince Harry: Weapon manufacturers should help with mine clearance
With a blue splitter vest, the British Prince Harry symbolically burned and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola. Near a British halo Trust camp near the town of Dirico, he set up the ignition circuit. In a safe distance, the explosives exploded. In view of the goal of getting Angola to 2025 min free, he later called on TV cameras: "I call all the countries whose names are standing on these weapons, but which have not helped in the field to commit themselves to help".
Pounds under pressure - interest expected
British Pound Sterling
In the light of a sudden decline in interest, the fund loses value over the euro.
Frankfurt's speculations on an early interest rate of the Bank of England (BoE) add to the pound sterling. On Friday, the British currency amounted to up to 0.4 percent to $1,2269.
The sellers of the sales were expressions by Notenbanker Michael Saunders. This led to an interest rate in the conversation, even if a chaotic Brexit could be rejected, as the insurance would affect the British economy in an invisible time. This statement was surprising, since Saunders was considered to be the advocate of a restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed to the economic pressures caused by the Brexit Hickhack without directly signaling a rise in interest. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wanted to lead his country from the EU without a divorce agreement to 31 October.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister took a high risk, but it could pay for him, says commercial editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Show more Russian manipulations
Material from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, the sole director of the World Anti-Tidoping Agency (Wada) and today's Head of Integrity of the Light Athletics Association.
New details on the Doping scandal in Russia appear to be emerging - and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had gained by the beginning of the year and only recently. In January 2019 the Moscow Doping laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Tidoping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out that they were faked.
In December 2014, the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) was banned for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee read after an individual examination in the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, about 270 athletes from the country under a neutral flag, while in the winter games in February 2018 there were 168 Russian athletes and athletes at the beginning. Also at the World Cups in the various sports, they could be in the summer, even the football World Cup with the host took place in Russia.
No positive results
In the following September, the Wada raised the Rusada band again, but called for access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should provide an overview of the extent of doping cases at the state docking. They should help to punish athletes and athletes afterwards. Three months later they were delivered to the final.
However, the president of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the Light Athletics World Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory has been manipulated. "Yes. We have received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the Task Force has received the correct data," David Howman said in the interview of the "Frankfurter General newspaper" on Friday. "We have identified a number of differences between the data that the Wada has received from a whistleblower and those that they have received from the Russians in January." Many positive findings that were mentioned in the McLaren report were missing.
Not affected by the WM
This confirms the position of the IAAF: The Light Athletes Association holds as the only organization on the Bann of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they were training outside the Russian system and undergoing tests.
At the beginning of this week, Wada had already put the manipulations into space and called on Russia to respond to the predictions within three weeks. Russia now threatens the new barrier of Rusada and, in the worst case, also the exclusion of the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
