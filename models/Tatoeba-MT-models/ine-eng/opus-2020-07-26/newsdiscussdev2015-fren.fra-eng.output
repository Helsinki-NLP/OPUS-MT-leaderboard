It seems to me to be a typical rugby club.
In an English university, maybe...
Nothing to do with the rugby clubs I know in NZ.
But that doesn't justify anything, does it?
Of course not, but the assumption that it's common in the rugby is the big thing...
Yes, we do not interrupt the prayers of Muslims and we do not break a person's nose during the drinking games (at last, except if it is part of the game), but we have actually painted black for some dejected evenings.
I've never played a drinking game based on the Nazi theme.
Yesha and Ride the Bus are enough.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and feeling expressed in the perspective of first year students showed me quite typical.
That said, this new information leaves no doubt in my eyes that they go far beyond the mesogynian jokes and the jokes of alcohol that are often associated with university rugby teams.
The incident with Muslim students shows particularly well that they are trying to provoke the maximum.
You probably don't know anything about rugby clubs.
But let's go, why let your injuries and your stereotypes stop the facts?
I imagine that the LSE rugby team is popular with former students from these schools for which the rugby competition is a tradition.
In other words, old boys in private.
Outputs from very different environments than those that play the rugby in NZ, very different attitudes.
So are the "misogynous pleasures" acceptable?
I've never seen racist behavior in my university, but the naked races through campus, flight, property damage, and misogynism were all part of the game.
Absolutely not.
I'm sorry I didn't mention it in my last comment.
You can see it differently: say that your own body is partly made up of this ancestral water.
I'm going to win the serenity.
therefore also this interstellar cloud (ouf, not traditional:))
@lux You have not read the article: a small half of your diet water is more than 4.6 billion years old...
Yeah, well, we can all of a sudden consider that the bread fleet has on average easily over 2.3 billion years, which is not so bad as this
A sacred foot of nose to catastropists and warmers of any hair that predicts the end of the oceans and water resources, while this water always exists.
One irrefutable evidence that heating stopped 20 years ago (see the remarkable work of Serge Ferry funded by Total and Areva).
@manon too: What is evidence that the heating stopped?
I don't see the link.
I think Manon Troppo's comment is ironic.
Hey, and for the second degree and irony, what do you have as a signal?
So you don't understand much about environmental issues.
It is not a question for the "catastrophes" as you say to worry about the disappearance of the oceans but rather about the reduction of human reserves in human consumption (you know the soft water that represents less than 1% of the total water reserves on our planet).
And then, more generally, it is not climate warming that is most threatening for our species, but especially the reduction of scarce or non-renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) that support our increasingly gourmet lifestyles.
As for the study that you quote and which you make a generous effort to quote the source, there is no doubt that the truth of the conclusion is true.
With regard to soft water problems, I assure you the French are far from being concerned xD Then you have to stop considering ecology as a no faulty dogma, the hole in the ozone layer is being referred quietly (estimation 100% for 2050 at the current rate).
Yes, the ecology is religiously dogmatic and unreasonable, not thank you.
"Then we have to stop considering ecology as an unbreakable dogma, the hole in the ozone layer is being referred to peacefully" Yes, it is not as if it was a spontaneous movement that would come from nothing.
@martin: I just want to specify that climate heating is a necessity because if we release too much CO2 our land will look like Venus.
A lock that by the action of the oxygen will capture the heat without releasing it and that in a vicious circle will accelerate the process of closing exponentially.
Has anyone seen direct actions so far?
Or the least sign indicating that 10,000 bonhommes would come to the field to plant trees and do what a green army is supposed to do, what could that be?
I'm sure not me!
In the small brain of Abbott, perhaps sending RAAF to the Middle East is its version of direct action.
We're making progress, that's for sure.
When are they gonna get rid of this idiot from the village?
The latest revelations that vegetation would consume 16% of CO2 more than any climate model allows priority to be given to replanting.
It is logical not, since CO2 is the food of plants that is the most abundant in nature, and it is necessary to preserve the flower worldwide.
It seems that this scientific fact has never been discussed.
Have you seen the army somewhere?
Don't do anything, dear government.
The levels of CO2 increase from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is rising, your argument of food of plants is only a failed distraction.
And before you throw your glass against the Dooms wall, the most abundant fertilizer is not CO2 but nitrogen and sulphur.
The most abundant materials generated biologically may be carbon, but this does not mean that it is the most abundant fertilizer, so Silverhead's argument is false and deserves to be ridiculed.
Direct Action is a farce, because nothing can happen again.
LandCare's budget has been severely reduced and this money is now spent by the Green Army.
The problem is that instead of investing money where it was most beneficial, it is now investing where it will get the most publicity to get the liberals back to marginal electors.
Your contribution, on the other hand, deserves the price of ignorance, good champion.
SilverHead, when there is too much CO2 in the air, plants produce less photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
This means that animals and people need to eat them in a much larger amount to benefit from their nutritional benefits.
The fact that this Member is powerful is obvious.
So far, he has not presented a certificate of academic rigidity that prevents him from breaking the rules of XVII.
However, punishing him and not Thévenoud is incomprehensible for the evil of the world, even though the regulation of the AN is not a tax treaty.
That this lady's doing a whole thing isn't to her honor, it looks mostly like the hysteria.
If Mitterrand had put all those who spoke Mitran to the amendment...
I remember that during the debate on the feminization of names, the "Academie" had taken place: "Let's tell Mrs. Sceaux's guardian or guardian" (a post that had never been occupied by a woman so far).
Pure masquerade!
"The political arena" ...!
The sandbag, the back-court of the Republic fills, the marigot of the operatte guillotes, the chart of the illusions, and ...
But the arena assumes gladiators, people who take real risks, good will, bad will.
Qd the Phallocrate Upist sits on the label and parliamentary regulation by turning to the + elemental civility under the false paraplegic manners, the penalty applies to him "the quality" for his partial intent and his measuring of the political arena.
The behaviour of this Member is neither normal nor worthy of his position.
He's making a provocation to talk about him.
Until now he was unknown, now he may be proud to be known as any cancer of a primary class.
The Academy at the back and it's seen that the Members are sensitive to the pocket...
The UMP will have to work to solve its internal problems and stop causing shocks and scandals.
The Academy has a good back, especially when you're told what it doesn't say.
This Member is acting as a full-time college in the adolescent crisis, which causes provocation and whose partners are going, in delegation, to see the Principal to cancel the collagen hours.
and defending him on the basis of a text that they have not even read!
Women do not even represent 15% of the signatories of the UMP MPs.
Mr. Judge, I appeal to two expert witnesses who are a few thousand years apart.
That's why I like to spend time with animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so obvious and attractive.
Dogs, dolphins, otars, horses, they do all the stupid things for the simple pleasure that it brings them.
On the contrary, it would seem that we spend the majority of our 80 years working, moving and making stores.
What a strange phase we have achieved - we are able to multiply by two our life span, but we pass most of it in boredom.
How did we get here?
Thanks to the illusion that it is anthropomorphism.
The game is a metacommunication.
Try again.
It's always an illusion.
In addition, the "communication" necessarily involves a shared symbol system.
A difficult concept for you, perhaps?
I imagine that the concept of inter-species communication is not compatible with your beliefs.
That's right.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate to the dog I would like to play – basic body language.
After that, there is a variation that indicates whether the game will be a race, an object to be searched, etc.
It is not difficult and there is no anthropomorphism – although I agree with the idea that we hear a lot of controversy about animals that are "playing" while they are just communicating.
Perhaps the game is not just "useful" (it may or may not be), it is just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber is of the opinion that "there is a principle of play based on any physical reality".
"If he had learned at school that a woman is not an object, he might not have violated it" Maybe he had the hope of living...
Thank you for the hope of giving you the opportunity to live, to be in good health and to be able to respond to an article today when you had to drink the information without being able to respond to it at just 15 years ago.
In general, I am not against ideas, and I would even tend to be quite enthusiastic about those who appear to be premeditated.
But when we see what many have kept from their school education, especially among the public who are likely to commit aggression against women, my enthusiasm does not find the least beginning of the anchoring point.
"the most likely public to get rid of attacks on women" We would like to know a little more.
Or rather, no, it's good, we got it.
And yes, reality doesn't always feel pink, even if it doesn't necessarily match your thinking patterns.
It is true that Neuilly's golden youth and other beautiful neighborhoods don't listen much in class.
She prefers to play on her iphone6.
Evry's disgruntled youth too!
If the lines were no longer responding, Twitter would no longer be able to follow Le Pen and Sarko in first choice.
I didn't learn anything from all this at school and I never raped anyone (and that's not in my intentions).
Do I have to love luck?
Unless I had parents to teach me some values....
The micro-family society is the learning of social life.
How to start reading life when you don't know how to read?
And is it that the young socialists go to school to teach male equality?
It would be more effective than making moralizing mountings on Twitter, but it would have to come out of beautiful neighborhoods...
Grotesque this campaign.
They're zero everywhere, but to give moral lessons, it's still the best.
It's all photogenic, but I still want to see the bread in a hat.
There's a joke about using his bread there.
This week's article doesn't go soft.
It's not time to make jokes about bread, man!
A little sensitivity!
You have made a double-meaning word game with the word "naan" to refer to a grandmother.
60 pounds for that?
It wouldn't even fill the stomach of a 90-year-old in a retirement home.
How does it happen that the more we pay, the less we have in the seat?
Because the quality of the experience does not necessarily measure the weight or number of calories, as does the quality of a film or a piece not determined by its length.
Yes, I agree with you.
But why should the good food be served in portions that would not even satisfy a monk?
It makes no sense, and it's just a deliberate policy to make you buy more dishes.
Of course he doesn't have to be like that.
The Sportsman in Seasalter is at least a very good restaurant where the portions and prices are both reasonably high.
You pay more because you're still hungry after several mini dishes.
The more you pay, the more you have the chance to receive a child portion with art in your seat.
At least they've made an effort to put on nuggets.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you're telling me I should go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of the many other (excellent) restaurants in York before deciding that London is the only place on Earth where you can taste good dishes?
Is that the Manif for all is only a Catholic and Muslim movement.
Yes, that's a sort of homophobic collection.
But it's not just here.
There are also atheists and humanists who do not want modern systems of "child manufacturing".
A child must not be raised in a battery or manufactured by a technological device.
Batterylifting?
That's what you're looking for.
And if you respond to any technical intervention in the "fabrication", you must demand the ban on PMA for heterosexual couples, it would be worth the consistency.
I am also surprised that the manif claimed "for all" has not yet had this logical claim to its attractive catalogue.
it is true that this is not the only cathos that manifest: the other religions also, Jews, Muslims, Protestants.
However, it is useful to remember that these different churches were opposed to all developments in society: in 1865 (and I join G.
Kauffmann) a bishop, Mr. Dupanloup was violent against the gvt's will to admit girls to school in the name of "family defense".
We're still in the same schedule.
And, more recently, the same currents have focused on the collapse of civilization and the destruction of the family when the school became mixed.
That is the credit that can be given to the positions of these people.
There's no need to be catho to get angry with the marketing of windows and children...
All of this is in the right line of the decadence of Western civilization, increasingly challenged by others!
For me, freedom stops from the other: yes, to the recognition of homosexual couples who have the right to love each other as much as the others.
But there is no question that the child is a furniture object.
And this is also valid for the GPA heteros in search of.
I just can't love this guy or recognize his results.
If he had better control of the ball and knew to avoid moments of fusing stupidity, he could have been a more popular player.
In addition, I'm sure any other attacker, except Heskey, who plays so many games for England, will accumulate a respectable number of goals.
Imagine how many goals Peter Crouch would have noticed if he had been given more than 42 selections in the national team...
I cannot disagree, at least not categorically:) Since this article talks about the goals he has set, I will not talk about other things he brings, especially in ManUtd (where RvP, Mata, Kagawa bring nothing or nothing), but perhaps it would be another reason why he has been selected much more often than, say, Peter Crouch.
Bothham77 hoddle1 07 October 2014 12h48 Recommended 119 It's the way to criticize Rooney at this moment so you can be forgiven to do so too.
This says it is good to take into account that since signing with Manchester City in August 2011, Aguero has marked 56 goals and made 23 final steps in 93 matches.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney scored 59 goals and made 32 finals in 96 matches.
So many people will have to find another excuse to take it to our Wazza because its states on the ground are excellent.
Furthermore, "Wazza" is a good reason to ridicule him.
I have to ask myself if you really look at the foto or if you think that Peter Crouch A) would deserve so many selections as Rowey and B) would mark so many goals if he had so many selections.
I really don't understand where the criticisms about Rooney's capabilities come from as a football player.
The hardest thing is to be selected regularly in his country team for 13 years, and to continue...
Are you serious about comparing Wayne Rooney's football qualities (even not attacking) to Peter Crouch's?
Are you doing this without a joke?
There's really a whole lot of people.
Please note also for your government that Rooney hasn't always been the front-centre machine for the purposes of England during his career as a team of England.
Instead, he played the former, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players such as Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch, mentioned above, Jermain Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturridge.
You must've written that by lying.
In a country where the port of arms is tolerated and in a state where 71% of people have a gun, I find it completely schizophrenic and paradoxical as a way to proceed.
And those in this school are not exactly in agreement with the U.S. Army Port Authority!
The use of the skull is always suicide.
Stop at the corner: the girl is 5 years old.
How many guys play with fake guns at this age in our home?
Is this actually the power killers for that much?
Although the military port is in the American constitution and this has a strong influence on the country's culture, I do not believe that the rich girls are significantly different from ours.
A little good sense and reason saved etc.
It's a disarmament process!
Make sure you're clear!
Information on this fact is insufficient to assess whether this little girl actually has, or does not have, premises at the taste of the morbidity.
Could we leave the principle that a serial killer can't already have a weird behavior at the age of 5 years?
If people need a psy follow-up, they're more mabols in this school than students!
Let the parents get their boyfriend out of here: she's in danger!
Totally agreed.
Those who manage this school are manifestly ill.
Your response is much more relevant.
Alabama is not the most representative state in the United States, but it is part of it.
What an incomprehensible country!
Your relative youth?
These glowing blue ribs that men wear have nothing to do with an entrepreneur!
What was Alan Sugar or Richard Branson carrying at the start of their career?
In their first photos, Lord Sugar was wearing a long leather coat and Sir Richard Branson was wearing a rolled-up dick.
I can't comment too much because I've never looked at this, but everything seems so boring and without a soul.
I don't think that's what he meant.
Contrarier, maybe?
But what a depressing air!
You're ahead of me.
I'd have thought a lean knowledge of English would be an asset to business.
I wonder what Mr. Bjayou is doing these days.
Maybe by saying "Ostracize," he meant "foreign."
That would make sense.
No, I thought that's what he might have wanted to say, but ostracizing still doesn't make sense.
Unfortunately, if all the candidates were dressed like Carmen Miranda and that Sugar was wearing a grey costume, it could be advanced that their intention was to ostracize it.
But here, no.
It seems that this has been corrected – weird. Maybe the whole sentence has been invented!
That's not weird.
Haha, who knows what he could say?
Surely nothing, but someone wanted to quote something completely...
So yes, the word used in the article was well "ostracize", which was absolutely nothing to say.
The unemployment rate in the United States still dropped by about 6%.
Never seen since 2001.
Fuel prices are falling in all states.
The American economy, with Obama, is constantly strengthened.
Who says better?
You have a very short view...
Does their economy become "sustainable"?
To live in this moment, I would say that the United States is getting a little closer to the explosion as inequality becomes crazy.
The political system is literally driven by the state of funding for electoral campaigns.
Racial tensions, police violence, mass incarceration have an extent that is not imagined in Europe, but Americans keep an incredible optimism in the future of their country and theirs!
Until when?
This is the main issue.
A few days ago, the English financial environment said that France was lost.
Now, it's America that's at the end of his roll.
Fortunately, there will always be the UK to save the world.
Another one of these articles that simply forgets the essentials.
The level of consumption of the American economy is no longer sustainable...
Tickets and billboards could not give the change for a long time...
Based on the exhausting of earth's resources and the growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And necessarily the weakest and the poor, a very large majority of citizens, will "drink" or rather die.
I can't bluff this Farrage.
Will the Labourer finally understand that his cynic and deliberate policy of importing foreign-compared voters make him lose even more support at home?
I probably don't think so.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to advance at any price.
LOL It was to please our American masters and their continuing cold war with Russia.
Shameful performance of the Labour, Ed Milliband is in the museum, this is played by 617 votes.
About Clacton 11% for Labour – shocking, really shocking.
Everyone is more or less aware that the massive immigration policy of the Blair government was designed to "feel the nose of the right in diversity"
The Labour wins partial election, the Tories loses partial election in a safe seat against Ukip = Crisis Labour Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
I imagine that it is the same multiculturalism that has led to this return of manoeuvre, the pendulum has been very far away since the end of the war, and I imagine that now it will split into another sense.
Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
Lol - Sørège du Labor, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depressing Jack, you know, I know, anyone who's not in the shit know.
Of course, the Tories have seen much worse, but for the Labour it is a victory in the Pyrrhus.
Look for the word "victoire" in any context, and you will see that when it is used in an argumentative way against the word "failure", it wins the battle!
I agree, Jack, it's a win, but it's a win.
The Labour Party should have won at least a few thousand votes.
If they record performance like that in a safe seat, can you honestly imagine them winning the majority?
Personally, I am indifferent to what I won in 2015 as long as the Lib Dems are not there.
You obviously don't understand how our parliamentary democracy works, do you?
Yes, I know the ice creams of Canada, Greenland and northern Russia are going to be tough.
On the other hand, I wonder if the alignment of Venus and March etc. should not be considered as well?
In general, we need to see the Earth more “paste ” or malignant than we can imagine.
Is that right?
A few small insights.
On the other hand, Wylie tells us of a " fairly simple mechanism: with the disappearance of the ice that weighs on the ground crust, the pressure on the coat relaxes, which gives/would give a) a blow to the production of magma b) while facilitating its access to the surface?????
In any case, either the "cut-off" is the ease of access to the seraint surface (more or less) located.
It is difficult to distinguish the cause of the effect and the reverse As regards climate heating, it seems prudent to focus rather on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Very friendly, patriced, does this volcanism have any effect on our environment?
Does it have any effect on our climate heating, future or past?
Is Prudence not to warm up?
When complexity is not resolved by simplification, let us apply this simplicity and observe it.
Yeah, but also, when he's at night, we see less.
Hello, the end of the last ice period has also been accompanied by a stronger seismic activity, particularly in the "active" mountain ranges where on the highly-glazed continental parts of Canada, Scandinavia).
Cordially CB
It is too often ignored that the earth's crust floats on the magma and that the only passage of the moon makes it rise or descend from some 30 to 60 cm, otherwise, according to its passage to the zenith, as it does for ocean waters.
What makes tectonic plates smoother, like the seams, is more or less facilitated by this moving box, as polar rocks are allied by the source of the ice, thus causing a change in the balance of the earth to the equator, as the volume of the earth remains constant.
I am am amused by this "human" saying the Supreme of Nature and its self-proclaimed commander, laughing at his stupid action on the environment that created it and which so separated itself that it became harmful to him and to the environment.
And all of this to remain the supreme commander of this nature who exceeds it in the organization of his own vices, by an invention that is to find all the means possible to dominate his neighbor, each other, laughing at collaboration, money.
The earth's crust is not based on magma, but on the earth's mantle, which is made of solid rock.
I personally find it impossible to look at.
Pretentious and arrogant.
That reminds me of Ascent of Man de Bronowski.
Live the next part.
Beautiful History Wild1
This reminds me of a completely brilliant 2002 series called "Ape-man".
One of the best documentary series I've ever seen.
Strangely, almost no one remembers it now.
It's a shame you've never passed the first impression.
Your loss...
"The Ice Ages, our distant ancestors" You should look again at this passage.
Or read about evolution.
Super program thank you Brian
I am almost sure that the documentary "History of Humanity" has already been realized several times, they always go to Ethiopia (evidently)
Oh here I don't support this guy, Brian "air miles" Cox, who goes to Ethiopia to pretend to make eyebrows in front of a brain in a mouth.
And his story...
It must be hard for you to watch Coxy.
Maybe there's a support group for you, that's what I'm saying.
I agree, everything is presented in a way that I can understand.
I loved the program, wonderfully filmed.
Is Marcel Gauchet a Marxist compass?
Indeed, it is the individualist identity that exists today.
So she needs to be herself, so that's not the case.
True, but Descartes is also present at the time of the event of individualism, and his intellectual question expresses this conviction.
But at this time it is just the assumptions that appear, today individualism structures the whole society, whether educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We are well in the individualism of "mass" !!
Without making an inexhaustible horizon, there is no relativeness with the Cartesian approach to examining what we are given to believe, what we believe ourselves.
More than rebellion, the doubt is fecund.
Facing Foucault as a revolutionary is absurd.
Many xxx-liberals refer to it and claim it.
His work on psychiatry has produced a counter-reform!
When the problem was at the level of his paranoid number, he blocked all progress and reflection on the reality of madness.
And brought the most reducing and reactionary vision under: behaviorism.
Gauchet is absolutely right about this point and to be anti-conformist, it is to fight this development.
We blame Marcel Gauchet for being a defender of the order.
Excellent idea!
Be nice and rebellious, let's ask some...
Black and red, to the others.
Beaps and robots, they include the most followers of those who see rebeauties in their mirror.
Thank you, in any case, for his controversial controversy about putting Marcel Gauchet under the light of the news, this humanist patient and persistent, and so pedagogically illustrating.
David Cameron supports the increase in the tax threshold on inheritance
How many other budget cuts will be needed to pay the social benefits of this rich person?
Dave the robot will well increase its net value once it is no longer in power.
Business advice, speeches, consultation costs, a series of best sellers written by a nigger on the "serious policy" – it will be worth £100 once he has passed the gun to the left.
Of course, he doesn't want to be taxed on inheritance.
Wouldn't that be the same lie as the last election?
And the richest are those who will pay very much the least inheritance tax due to super-paid accountants and tax evasion programs.
This has all the signs of an Empire in decline where the heritage kills innovation.
he will be worth £100 once he has passed the gun to the left.
Anything.
He'll probably promise to increase the threshold to £1 million, which is well beyond what you say is worth.
What was your position when the Labour doubled the threshold to 650,000 for couples?
Did you also think Brown was thinking only of his own heirs, or are you just a brainless tribalist?
We haven't picked her last time, we've had a coalition in place.
You couldn't afford to accuse him of lying unless we had actually elected him to power.
Like the rest of us, "Dave" will not die "normal".
Climate change and collapse will bring it to an end, he and the others of his ending.
His “richness ” will be as useless as that of others and will not save him or his children.
Untaxable income is a social advantage, especially in a country where government debt exceeds £ 1,000,000,000,000.
We all have to be imposed to pay the essential services and repay the debt.
I agree with you Exdionys.
I do not say that discipline teaching is unnecessary, of course, I only say that it is insufficient to compensate for some natural "adequacies".
Little rational statement for the professor of mathematics she was!
Like what...
Better recruitment and training for teachers is a qualitative approach.
However, the French political class knows no other approach than quantitative.
There are 2 possible answers, the 1st would be to select teachers according to their ability to transmit knowledge => reforming recruitment modalities.
From +, she hates children because she doesn't understand them.
Not understanding them, she doesn't know how to act or react to work well => she's reduced to establishing a trust relationship that makes everybody suffer from a loss of pure => it would take 1 training to teach.
A profession that learns, of course.
But teaching is primarily an art, a natural arrangement and a vocation before being a technique.
Working on and with human beings is not to manufacture car parts.
This teaching doesn't work out even when we're pro of math!
"Education sciences" cannot compensate for a lack of natural skills.
What is currently lacking, precisely, is a true vocation for those who embrace the professors
If the gifts exist, the teaching (I prefer discipline) allows those who have less help not to make mistakes.
There are ways to address a more effective question.
The real unknown today are the students who tell us 1/3: learning does not serve at all I already know what I think.
A Slate article describes the chaotic situation of this return quite well.
Let's regret the old Normal Schools of Institutes..
It ends at 3 o'clock in the morning from this week, but it starts at midnight.
If this is the case, it is appropriate to use the time.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
That doesn't fit mine!
It's been years since his show started at midnight.
We have this thing that's called iplayer and that allows us to listen to the demand when we want it!
The Internet, it's amazing, isn't it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB at my home, I can't really listen to radio shows anymore.
I have a usb type adapter at the back of my SKY box, which is connected to the Internet but listening to the radio on my TV made it very complicated.
Yeah, I think I've been wrong in the hours, I had to hear Richard Lester at about 3 hours.
Although it's men in the day on Radio 2, they could at least put a woman in her antenna watch when one of the men is on vacation or sick, at least it would make people happy.
They should start by getting rid of Jeremy Vine.
Its issue is any sensational in the debate, and it would be much better on a chain like LBC.
The lack of DJ women in the day, where none of the regular animators, of Chris Evans in the morning at Simon May's show in the evening at work, is not a woman
It's five shows.
So which (of these five) is most likely to be modified.
Shenan knows very well, but doesn't say anything - for now.
Steve Wright is the most semi-retardant of these times.
Jeremy Vine may be sent to the offices as a real journalist, but lunch keeps all the ice-cream air from a Daily Mail radio.
I imagine it's quiet, to wait for the current team to hit or turn.
I was born in Soissons in 1950!
Too late?
It's normal for these people to vote for the UN.
For 40 years we have the same two parties that alter power and make the keys of the country to the other in less good condition that they have not taken it.
The campaigns are very poor, much poorer than the bananas with increasing isolation.
It takes a few miles to find a movie, a bar, a gym, a theater.
But as they don't burn cars, they don't attack, they don't break, they don't interest political men...
But please don't talk about a department where you haven't lived.
Yes, Doclocal, it's under men, sociology is good to think about them.
They have very high rates of abstentism and early alcoholism as well...
The UN thrives on human battle, inculturation and ignorance as much as saying that it still has an enormous potential for growth, it really has to be bad for them not to do better...
Today, the UN thrives mainly on poverty, the fear of daily life, the fear of others and the feeling of having no prospects.
But yes, you're right!
That pitiable human being.
Fortunately, there are a handful of people like you, intelligent, cultivated and educated to save the honor.
They've been looking for him.
Take the voters for c...
That's what happens.
Is that who they are?
"forgotten" there is less than a resource =>low of resources.
Here's the comment I left on Twitter (@priya963) Listen - you can't just "add and mix", women must be integrated into the development process.
What I want to say here is that in many developing countries, existing standards are questioned, such as childcare and socio-productive roles.
This makes it clear that women can work in the economic sphere and that it is super - it is necessary.
But it is not possible without recognizing the fact that women will then have a double blow, i.e. they will be expected to go to work while continuing to play their socio-reproductive role.
I'm not convinced of my sister.
The economy and profits do not recognize the roles of the sexes.
Money speaks, and if a sex isn't high, next!
The profits are laughing at your life.
What do you do, what is the advantage and what do you have to offer?
The benefits are ridiculed by the heroism and education of children.
If it were a crime, companies would listen.
Employers will never employ women 20 to 45 years of age.
Well said, my sister.
It is very problematic that no one is talking about social work that is not paid in this article.
In some countries, the value of unpaid social work (most of which is carried out by women) must be more than 50% of GDP.
Unpaid social work does not receive enough support and is undervalued (not to mention that men do not do enough), but it allows our companies to operate and preserve our work.
Unpaid social work is also an important reason why many women are unable to find a true "economic emancipation" outside the home...
Thank you for all your comments - to return to the point of Mskayadee, how can we take into account the disproportionate responsibilities of women when carrying out gender integration projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure it will help a lot people who have to "carry a house."
The tiger is not Russian, it's only Western propaganda.
The Chinese are the only ones responsible for the current situation and would be better able to sit at the negotiating table.
The right-to-self-determination tiger and the Russian soldiers are simply in operation near the border, long-term exercises ahead of the current situation.
In addition, the tiger has no anti-aircraft missiles in its possession.
Free the tiger!
You made my day!
Oh, yeah, you do.
He immediately came to me with the same idea.
Here is a pretext all found to arm a few separatists to attach China.
If Siberia's tiger is in China, China is in Siberia.
It's just time to fix this anomaly.
Why does an article on a tiger, magnificent feline and in real danger of extinction finally turn it into a well-directed article against Putin?
What's he doing in there?
So this is not a sheet on Siberian tiger, but a sheet on the suites of an operation of Putin's com.
When we expose ourselves to the media, we also expose ourselves to irony or criticism.
The return of eternal victimization of the soviet-poutian sympathiser.
Holland had also filled the powder with his shirt without shouting at the anti-French plot.
There our learning Alain Bougrain-Dubourg, the patron saint of the Great Russia, personally and physically involved in the reintroduction of this tiger.
In any case, the tiger understands everything, he's barging...
That Holland's getting sick, that's one thing.
At first glance, it seemed to be an awfully condescending idea.
But on the basis of the article, it seems that it is both a response to a real problem - emergency dental subsidies - and effective.
So it's hard to find something to repeat.
And if only 53% of this sample were brushed before, and 73% afterwards, it's a little empty sense to complain about paternism.
After all, there is no discomfort in brushing your teeth!
As a matter of fact, the complaints seem to be related to the fact that they are targeted towards the unemployed and that this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if that is true, then it is not a justified criticism.
Belinda Smith, of the Canterbury Regional Health Committee, said that the department was concerned about the number of emergency dental grants offered by the Department of Labour and Revenue of the Ministry of Social Development to young unemployed adults.
On a media level, there would be better ways to implement it, I imagine.
But he seems reasonably well thought out.
There's a problem with brushing your teeth.
If you brush them after drinking wine, it can damage the enamel layer.
If your toothbrush is old and stiff, it can pick the knee and cause inflammation.
And I remember an issue on the Guinean book of memories where someone had tried to brush their teeth the longest and the Guinean judges at the time had strongly advised him to do so because of the adverse effects of a frequent and prolonged brushing of teeth.
'At first sight ' - very funny.
It seems to me to be a silly experimental concept.
The mere willingness to carry out this study would have changed the habits of participants who knew that tooth brushing would be studied.
That's why most behavioral studies include things like double blinds, witness groups, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the program itself.
Assuming that these texts are sent to each young person with social benefits, there are two things that differ from this test: 1) They are not volunteers, and 2) they do not provide feedback on both times they brush or brush their teeth (lightly mistaken results by people who give their results according to perceived expectations).
Is there any consequences at the epigenetic level?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) have shown that the maternal environment (including the uterus) could have an effect on genetic heritage, not in the genome, but in the expression of genes, and that these inherited traits could be transmitted to the next generation.
Does the uterine graph affect this phenomenon?
The nesting itself looks like a kind of graffiti.
There are probably consequences, but as long as we don't want to have a perfect clone of ourselves, is this a priority problem?
I think it's going beyond the reasonable limit.
The desire for motherhood and paternity should not lead to further further, without questioning the issue of ethics, taking risks, for the mother and for her baby.
No, medicine is not all powerful, no, it is not unlimited, and yes, it is unfortunate and painful to accept that all women will not have it, or the children they wish to have.
It has nothing, absolutely nothing, to see with the trance
But let the people, the women, the others, have their bodies, their sense of love that can go to risk and manage your little testicles to yourself, all alone in your little pants to yourself.
of their "conference" this magical bag for them to have this wonderful moment of pregnancy.
Why would I keep him in my safe fort if he could still give love.
The current harsh circumstances make PR FRYDMAN cautious about its communication, but if "we" agreed to reflect, "we" would admit that it is only the bag and not the genetic material involved.
What's going to put us as an anti argument: cf here these reactions of all men curiously....
Marjane, all organ donation has nothing to do with anodin.
I've been a plasma donor for years, it's not completely anodinous.
I was registered as a donor of spinach (I have never been selected because the selection is very strict and this is understood both for the recipient and for the donor), it is a real operation.
Now as a man, I will not be able to judge in a sense or another or take part in this gift, but I will listen to women talking about it.
@Margane: Actually, it has nothing to do with anodin, and it strengthens the act of love that it involves.
Giving a queen to a member of his family who needs it doesn't have any anodin anymore, and that's what happens!
Please don't mix Messi v Ronaldo.
It's low.
I agree, we don't need that.
Especially that there's no real competition anymore...
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
Messi is the best footballer.
Sports has become a yoyo club.
They're too good for Seconds but they don't have the League standard.
Rivaldo was not part of the title winning team.
Thank you for correcting me.
But Rivaldo played well for the Sportivo before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo who continues to do everything to beat all the Real Madrid goals records this season so that he can then return to Old Trafford this summer with a quiet conscience...
I can't believe it.
I think Ronaldo will put an end to his career in Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you want to talk about the stage of the international oil investment company?
I was looking at him on a fucking connection, so I can't tell you a big deal if it's not that Valencia had a good defense and without the possession, they deserved to win.
I was afraid the ground environment wasn't moving too fast, but they played well.
Parejo's game all over is getting better.
An afrocious penalty claimed but just saved by Diego.
A Chautious Ambient Mestalta and it shouldn't have been funny for the Atlético bus to bomb.
That's interesting.
A complete article, signed by young researcher Amanda Marshall, "On the origins of the mammification", is illustrated in the magazine Archeologia 524 of September last.
It is good to have arguments to confirm and date what is intuitively becoming.
No wonder you're making it simple before you make it complicated.
All science is progressing by small steps.
And was the "The Organ" of the woman who was so preserved for him?
Passionant!
Hello and thank you for your tickets.
It seemed to me to read a few times ago that a black child's mummie had been discovered in the current Libya and that this discovery had opened new horizons, particularly geographical and temporal (I think I remember that the mother was 1000 years old at the first known African mommies).
Do you have any information about this?
Thanks a lot.
She's doing a little reading.
These may not be contaminants of modern times.
The desert at the time wasn't more distant than it is now?
Why don't you imagine plants like cannabis pushing to where there's only sand right now?
We knew the song.
And it is enough for a well-known European to say it, even without any evidence, to be a scientific truth: the Egyptians and, therefore, the Africans of yesterday and today have never invented anything at home.
But the song does not tell us who are the inventors of African inventions in Africa.
If it's not always "of his bad predecessors."
You should read the article.
This is an article written by neoliberal free market kicks that preaches against the mobility of people and for the mobility of property.
I think there are other people affected by Ebola and who the Spanish government is lying to us, not to give themselves a bad image and to protect tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But they may remain silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same with regard to tourism, but the right governments in particular (i.e. those in Spain and the United Kingdom) tend to protect the interests of businesses rather than those of individuals.
Stop, don't hesitate to call your local MP and complain about the lack of transparency.
Although I think that the government here is only a band of celebrities, good at nothing and corrupt, as Madrid is not a very touristic place, I doubt that it is their greatest concern.
What are you waiting for?"
(with all the respect and compassion I have for the nurse and her colleagues), since tourism is one of the only things that enable millions of people in this country to keep their heads off the water, I would say that yes, it is important.
If they were absolutely to repatriate the missionaries, I don't see why they couldn't send them to a military base and care for them there in a field hospital, rather than in the capital, for example.
Rajoy had a mission to dismantle the Spanish health service, privatizing the nationalized hospitals especially in Madrid, which is its basis of power, until the courts intervened.
It's nothing but a right-wing angler in charge of public relations such as Cameron, and as Cameron, I think it's wrong in the next elections.
To be fair to Cameron (I know it's not easy here) socially he's far away from his right and he'd find his place well towards the religious error of the right in America.
Now he must sing the praises of the hospitals he had previously come down to try to achieve his goal of protecting Spanish tourism.
I am sorry, but you cannot really compare the Tories or any other European party on the right to Spanish law.
These are separate cases, believe me.
The Spanish Government is talking about almost everything that concerns it.
It's not like someone could accuse you of spreading unfounded rumors.
So you have tangible evidence to support this idea?
This section of the Guardian is called Comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Supiot.
Without putting work at the centre of production and the economy with its rights and guarantees, we will not get away with it.
Excellent article but especially fascinating reactions to the forum.
Many TPE patterns - SMEs seem to read The World to take the time to condemn Pr.
Let's talk about the anti-intellectualism of the environment.
A professor of law at the College of France seems unable to know the labour market unless he is a Nobel prize of economy and proposes to liberalize it completely
It was so much better before, it was true when Dr. Villerm found the work of children aged 8 and 10 hours a day, when the Canuts were getting out of sight because of a collective agreement signed.
Oh, good old time...
Your reaction is just as fascinating because of your ignorance of the TPE pattern business!
His profession is not to know the right in all his ways, but to manage and produce.
Four handwritten amounts registered on my youth salary bulletin, more than 100 information today!
Here is an example: much more could be said about it, which illustrates the constant flow of constraints, imposed without measure the consequences, and which exacerbate the small business.
Your paper would have been very useful if you had written it as an expert and not as a client of the Sorbon.
To break the neck to the arch-restrained argument of the French Labour Code's thickness compared to the lever, a serious university student would have drowned in the Swiss texts and compared the number of official texts, then the comments (the absence of the latter may mean that Swiss laws are more understandable than ours).
By commenting in a Code, whether of work or not, we refer to case law in particular...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is responsible for applying the laws when a employee is fired, for example....
Who's that complicated?
Do you find that the rules of law (laws, case law, conventions, contracts) are in the field of Labour and Trade of Unbearable Obstacles?
What's he doing?
How long does it take?
Pullmann "Art has become virtually immune to the criticism of Mrs.
Is this guy still on the line?
It's certainly time for new revolutionary absurdities to throw away criticism...
For each article on Ai Weiwei that I have recently read, you are part of the first three comments that complain about its popularity.
Get to another thing!
Go ahead and see, the choice is not lacking in the world of art.
If China can produce new artists who are not spokesmen of the Communist Party, the world will be interested.
Yes, GenisCan is probably a troll of the Chinese government.
I think China has produced a lot of good contemporary artists.
Those who are spokespersons of the Communist government are not appreciated in the West, and those who are not spokespersons are not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those of you who think Ai Weiwei's art is a kind of fraud, here's what you miss.
Thanks for that, you just ruined my breakfast.
I'm sorry, but I had to expose it at all costs (without making a bad word game).
It's the guy who breaks up the old irreplaceable ceramics and calls it art, right?
There's art, and then there's vandalism trying to draw attention.
The real artists make the difference.
A great artist.
His father is also a poet not bad.
His father was a well-known poet in China.

CARSENTY DEMISION This gentleman is unworthy to hold an electoral mandate for extremists on any board (including Zionists) to be separated
Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous theories of the plot, which have valued him with several judicial convictions, are ashamed of Israel as well as of the Marire de Neuilly.
He represents neither one nor the other.
Philippe Karsenty fights the truth alone, marginally.
WHAT IS A COMMON OBJECTION?
What is the account of the Marie de Neuilly v. Philipe Karsenty, who has been harassed by a journalist and his family, and who publicly calls on this urbanist to attack?
Crime apology?
I can't find Neuilly on my card?
Is a new administration that holds these new privileges???
This type needs care, as well as Ulcan Chelli, they both do in the theory of anti-juice/anti-Israel plot and the resources of which are perfectly identical to those of their most angry detractors.
Just as many people believe in any political decision to see the hand of "sionists" (the term of which tends to disappear, because of its abuse), both there, as the LDJ or the CRIF, believe to see in any criticism, even banal, an object anti-Semitism "that is not without remembering the darkest hours of our history because it is still ferocious to the belly of the beast my good lady would have come back to Russia of the 19th century!"
Noting that Karsenty's amazing theories on Charles Enderlin's report are even more stupid than those on September 11th.
And God knows that the theories of the plot on September 11 are of a very fragile beast.
And this guy has political responsibilities, it's extremely worrying.
To clarify my analogy with the conspiracy theory of 11 September, we are talking about cognitive dissonance on how to address the issue.
Totally blinded by a completely pale truth, having spent too much time, spending too much money to support it, it is unbearable for this theory to detach itself (as in the case of extreme religious ones).
When a logical and unelectable escapes ahead, the end justifies all means, even the lie, which is a complex, but sets do not seem to disturb the mission of the person concerned.
You advise to be careful not to put everyone in the same basket, but that's what you do for September 11th.
There is still a multitude of unanswered questions for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudiens/consorts do not seem to be ready to answer.
There are actually very pale theories, but the official theory is also, at least on a few points.
Oh, nothing else is funny now...
Health NGOs and public health spokespersons find that the results of the study are largely in favour of their awareness efforts.
And, of course, they will need more subsidies to follow!!
Just as smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and is now recognized for what it really is, alcohol will also know its time of judgment where the real damage it causes in our society will be exposed.
More than waiting for everyone to attack me now...
Well, it's easy to say things like "excessive consumption of alcohol is increasing", but what you ask for (a little) more effort is to give real facts.
I'm sorry if you consider this an attack - will you drink a glass and rest?
It's better to put my mental health at risk by avoiding me.
The government will end the fun when it costs money.
Here are other alarmist advice based on untrustworthy statistics.
Two medium glasses per day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quote seems to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers, but the second implies that it is more or less safe.
Perhaps the Cancer Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council should agree (about one or two glasses, but above all not three) and give us a figure on which they agree - whether justified or not.
Now, we're gonna take them deep, like the smokers!
They're already doing it - soon it's gonna be herb!
My father didn't drink and smoke, and cancer took him to 64 years old.
So I'll keep drinking my two red bottles on Fridays and Saturdays night (and the other nights when my wife isn't here).
Why does the Cancer Council encourage children to go to places where alcohol is served It is an old fact that the Cancer Council has deliberately ignored.
What's not related to a risk of cancer today???
The sharks don't catch cancer - they eat anything but they're not a good company.
The sharks can catch cancer - skin cancer.
Charlie Whiting's incompetence has been a recurring subject for many years.
Refuse to run when one can run and reciprocate.
That's completely in agreement.
Whiting is Bernie's blessing.
Both of them destroyed the F1 under a security pretext.
Let's hope it gets better than Schumi or worse Wendlinger's accident in 1994.
Absolutely agreed with you, but attention to point 1: it is not the F1, but the circuit authorities who refused to move forward so as not to gloat the television broadcasters.
All right, +1
I just want a quick and quick recovery to Jules Bianchi!
Brazil 2003, Europe 2007, the incidents that have failed between detonating cranes and f1 have been free of charge.
It was known that one day this would happen, and Jacques Laffite, among other things, has been saying it for years.
How the hell did the race organisation and the FIA allow these maneuvers without leaving the safety car?
I can't accept that we invoke the risks of the business or the luck failure when we haven't prevented the predictable.
But this accident was it.
It must also be said, however, that there was a yellow flag, which not only means "prohibition of crossing the area" but is primarily intended to signal a danger.
It's not embarrassing, it's fortunately for the family who was supposed to be in front of the TV.
Even under the yellow flag, the pilots are just going to lift their feet.
Under changing conditions, the turn can be much more sticky the next turn and the pilot, believing to arrive with sufficient margin, may even be "reduced" at a normal speed.
But, well, we're caused in the vacuum, until we haven't seen the images, we can't give a notice.
I don't see much of what this changes.
Are there any injured?
According to the CBC, no injury was reported.
The CBC showed the information this morning before this happened, which makes me wonder what caused the derailment.
It's hard to believe there's still work to be kept 24 hours a day.
I don't think there's any injured people there, because Canada is almost empty.
There may be animals injured such as bears, rats, etc.
I hope it's ironic.
Some parts of Vancouver have the strongest population density in North America and the Toronto agglomeration has at least six million inhabitants.
In the Saskatchewan campaign, trains do not derail as by enchanting and these types of trains often cross popular urban areas.
Almost every Canadian city is crossed by a railway line, and trains are very, very often in a day.
In addition, as roads often follow water courses in regions where there are lakes, rivers or oceans, they also go to densely populated areas, because people always want to live near the water.
Also, all rail traffic across the centre of a city as it was a central element of the original construction of railway lines here.
You may have tried to be funny, but there is an enormous potential for railway disasters in Canada.
Mansbridge made a report on this last night, really shocking.
Of course you didn't read the article on the derailment and explosion of a train in a city of Quebec that killed 47 people?
In fact, you're partly right.
The city of Vancouver was a port city just before the railway.
This says, when the railways were built, they passed through the centre of the established communities because it was the most direct and central road.
Perhaps employees of the Canadian National Railway Corporation should go to the next Conference on Dangerous Products in Calgary in Canada on 2 and 3 December 2014.
CN employees are long trained in the transport of dangerous products.
This article, like many comments, has little to do with the fundamental religious question: a religion is a revealed truth and for its believers it could not exist any other truth.
All the problem is here, and the theological performances only reinforce this, but what good is it to speak about the sex of angels?
"God said: it is good - it is bad" > It is not compatible with democracy, it is called dictatorship (variant: theocracy).
The word of a leader (Muslim country but no importance): "But without religion, how do you want to keep the people?" .
In other words: obey the curate priest rabbin rabbin imam and pray, it will be better!

Yes, that's what Voltaire and others thought, so Robespierre in a certain way, trying to establish a cult of the Supreme Etre.
But our oligarchy also has its cults : that of the Euro fort ( rather at the moment ) or that of the free market ( that is to say , supported by the State when it has to run ) , etc .
Great ideas from religious resurrections.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and profane.
Where the rational emerges, the believer is on the trailer and expresses himself in the schism.
Religion was born as the ideological support of the State, and the gods served ambitions even though it also carried forms of dispute.
The theology of faithfulness to the form of revelation and adaptation to the weather was beyond doubt.
Fanatism is often described as a misinterpretation of "sacred texts".
This does not resist the examination of these texts that are full of explicit appeals to the hatred of the blasphemer.
Rather, they are the moderate religious (and fortunately the most) who "read badly" the texts and hold only what is true of humanism and common values throughout humanity, atheists and different believers.
For me, fanaticism is the vicious and evil application of passages from sacred texts out of their context.
Thus, some verses of the Qur'an calling to kill "mecreants", "infidels", "hypocrits", "Jewish" or "Christians" are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable if they are not read a few verses above or below specifying that these executions are justified only in cases where Muslims are attacked, killed and in a position of legitimate defense.
about Yves Petit:" about the "foulard", this is a very religious prescription that makes almost unanimous today among the "savourers".
There are idiots everywhere.
The only positive point to take from this is that it caused a general condemnation.
Especially in Australia.
Aren't you guilty of the same damage he showed in the clip?
Neanderthal gang overpaid and hypersexualized.
They've accused humanity enough!
What have they brought us to be honest with the neighbors, For life, Summer Bay, Paul Hogan, Crocodile Dundee, Einstein Junior, Angry Anderson - Southdenly, Mental as Anything - Live It Up, Danni Minogue, Razorback, Baz Lurman, Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, Bee Gees, Shane Warne, Yahoo Serious, Ian Thorpe, Kylie Minogue, Men at Work, Hugh Jackman, the Devil of Tasmania and this satanic Skippy!
An insult to our intelligence, that's what he gave us!
If you take your eyes off the TV for a moment, you will see that Australia has a rich cultural heritage, starting with paintings in caves and on stone made by its indigenous peoples, which are still a source of inspiration for modern artists today.
And then there's Sydney Opera and a national opera company that produced wonderful songs like Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
Australian cinema produced films such as The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
The notable Australians include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blancett.
The only thing that insults your intelligence is you and your ignorance.
Russell Crowe is a New Zealander, and the Bee Gees were English.
Your intelligence really needs to be insulted!
Allow me to be of another opinion.

But you still don't know that Kastals is just a little Moscow telegrapher who has nothing to do with his days.
We leave him for a month and when we get back he's about to drop the same salads.
The nearly totality of the 331 deaths since the ceasefire are civilians of the Donbass who have been bombed by the army, due to uncontrollable elements according to Kiev.
The presentation of responsibilities hypocritically suggested in the article without hesitation to explicitly designate separatists is in the world's otanic line, which does not hesitate to reverse facts and responsibilities to maintain the weakness of pro-European neo-European peoples who courageously face the Russians.
@SavantCosinus: Change browser.

If I understand what you mean the wicked are the Ukrainians and the gentle Russian Stalinists you wouldn't be a little communist by chance
Extract from the (very long) document you quote about MH17: "This ticket has absolutely no purpose to say that pro-Donetsk resistants are innocent".
The Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation said that Ukraine was responsible.
The propaganda?
In Alexandre Kastals: where do you get these details about the unaccounted macabre?
From the Ukrainian army (unfortunately losing soldiers almost every day, according to it)?
Uncontrolled elements (like to say anything)?
ALLEEEUEEEUEUA ROMANIA!
AlleeeeeeeeeeyouHungary!
And I say this as a Romanian citizen.
From Transylvania, with a woman of Hungarian origin, on the other hand.
That says, I can't support the Piturca team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the authorities in place who has not stopped denouncing Romanian football to the pathetic level he has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the "Coperative", which decided before the start of the season which team would win the championship, which teams would be relegated in Europe, and which whitewashed the money at its will, mainly by selling players who were well underestimated.
Gica Popescu, the former captain of Barcelona, was doing business with the above-mentioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (about a million euros), then paid them, but, apparently he was ill advised by his lawyers, refused to admit his mistakes to the court (which would have cost him a fine-free sentence), and was then taken for 3 and a half years in prison.
The trial was also worth the prison for the Becali brothers, four club owners, the Steaua manager Mihai Stoica, and Popescu, for offences related to football.
George Becali also suffers a penalty for trying to suffocate (and then dissipate the facts) a team to beat us (CFR Cluj) in the last match of the championship, to win the title and win the jackpot of the League of Champions.
The team that he tried to drive was our neighbors from Cluj, University.
We won 1-0 in their stage, a result that allowed us to be the first champions of Cluj, while they were relegated.
I always enjoy this moment.
In the desimulation of this attempt to corruption, among other things, Piturca, who signed as a witness a false document suggesting that the money that the police had confiscated in Cluj was related to a field sale.
So this poor uneducated guy, idiot, cheater and liar doesn't represent me, and he will never do it.
The Hungarians are just a band of nationalists today.
You might think that after the last time they broke stage and shop windows, and when they branded racist banners in the streets, they couldn't have had tickets this time, but no.
I thought Neil Lennon was about to resume his reindeer in Al-Ittihad.

It's a great article.
If it were Sarkozy who had done this, we would've heard the left scream like a great sick man.
But as it is the gentle Holland, friends of the trade unions and small people, we hear a little protest, but everything is low.
This is why economic environments sometimes prefer that a party claiming to be on the left is placed in power.
These are the bankers who have financed Obama's victory, and they haven't had enough of their investment!
"The absurd idea that the majority of jobseekers are not looking for work" LOL (no comment)
Should employment pool generalise unemployment control early 2015?
I hope that in the pile, fiscal pole, it will also generalize the absolute control of the gugnars commonly called plutocrats, banksters, kleptocrats, tax evasions, stealing patterns, and other malandrins.
Do you know how to make a sentence without the words banksters or plutocrats?
You look very proud of your jargon every time
It's true when we're in class: we're dealing with people with illiteracy and without teeth.
In each new period of unemployment, there are dozens and dozens of applications that I address to employers who are most often not even aware of a receptionist, it was automated.
It is also the total absence of follow-up or support on the part of the Employment Pole.
To conclude, I would add that the patron name "socialist" of this government appears to me as an insult to the memory of Jaurès or Mendès France.
Did we read an article on the chain?
It is learned that a unemployed person can stay for several months without news from his agency, but that he must continue to seek employment by his own means.
It is learned that controls have allowed people who for more than half were no longer affected by unemployment.
We therefore wonder how we can control people that we never see.
The question is, what is the penalty for radiation for someone who does not have access to employment or unemployment benefits?
And if we can admit that this reform will allow for more radiation, we ask what it will help recruits.
"We learn that a unemployed person can stay for several months without news from his agency, but that he must continue to look for jobs by his own means" It is indeed shameful.
The question must be asked, why are these countries in the EU while the authorities are clearly unable to defend Europe's equal ideals?
Is it not as if the Spanish or Italian authorities had done a great deal about racism in the foot no more?
Should we chase them out of the EU?
The EU was of economic origin only and should remain.
The aim is not to be a "police of thought".
The EU is a peaceful project.
It doesn't make any sense on an economic level.
That is probably why Britain will soon leave the EU: it is the most unequal society in Europe.
What equality?
Eastern European teams are constantly being held by the mafia's criminals who are the UEFA.
The best solution would be that the whole East leaves this lucrative organization and creates its own.
At least we'll finally watch football.
This crusade of anti-racism is only a screen to cover injustice and corruption!
No, that's not true.
Money and trade, rather.
The European ideals of equality?
What, then, is Europe's failure to let the United Kingdom enter?
The Uefa should applaud them for having played the comedy of Blaster and his men.
It's been going on for a few years, and I'm not exaggerating.
Pulled from the Guardian two or three days ago:
Would he hope to see himself twisting small symmetrical phrases, just history of maintaining controversy?
Whatever it is, it is a fact that every small event towards peace, there has been, there will be and there will be people who use to pour oil on the fire.
The decoding would be that the Western States are against a "Palestinian State", that they are pro-Israeli, and that only explains that these States have never done anything against the Israeli State.
The decoding would be that in order to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian question, it would be necessary to take action against the Israeli identity-occupied Israeli state occupying occupying the siege of a colonizing oppressor.
In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestine to the detriment of an Arab population that was not for anything in the Shoah, it was more reasonable to empty the Bavaria of its German inhabitants (which they were guilty of the Shoah) to replace them by the surviving Jews.
As it would have been fair, the Germans had nothing to claim and Europe would have kept millions of educated, entrepreneurial and dynamic inhabitants.
Mr., let's take the example of the colonization of Western Sahara...
May Morocco be the colonialist, it's an obvious fact!
But as for Israel, it is also necessary to question history, its allies and its supporters to learn truths.
The colonialism, whatever it is, has never been altruistic, we agree.
Then stop your pirouettes to support Israel as a colonizer.
The Gaule was colonized by the Romans, but at present there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gauls or others.
In Palestine, there is very much discrimination based on origin.
Moreover, the Israeli State is defined as a "people of Jews" whose non-Jewish will not be included.
The Israeli state discriminates against the non-Jews, from which he is happy.
Conclusion: To resolve the conflict, it is necessary to break up with the anti-Jewish and non-Jewish Zionism.
In Maghreb, some peoples were even baptized in the name of their first status by this saving civilization!
Two realities to stop ignoring.
Primo, the European Zionist project (colonise-appropriate Palestine) implied possession of Palestinians, which was therefore an intrinsically anti-Palestinian project, so the solution needed to break up with Zionism.
Second, Zionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay has been missing bitant from the start.
Their young result will give them what bites their fingers.
It should begin its rehabilitation by small mouth.
I hope he hasn't lost the appetite of the game.
We tolerate so much subtlety, including racial prejudices and physically hard heels in football, but Suarez has been punished too hard.
I'd like to see him come back to England, no matter what the purists say.
Yeah, I hate all these molars.
Football is a contact sport where the keyboards exist and, therefore, players will get hurt.
Getting his teeth back into an opponent's flesh to have the advantage certainly doesn't have his place in the game.
A rugbyman was suspended for 80 matches to have committed a similar gesture.
It's now the third time Suarez does this.
If you bite someone at work.
What would be the consequences for you?
I knew someone was going to kill.
If you're dyslexic, I forgive you.
I'm actually slightly dyslexic.
I forgive this sarcasm to two balls.
I bet he was eager to come back and play with his teeth.
All these games of words on Suarez are losing their bite.
I had to bite the rabbit.
A prerequisite for a good school course is respect by the students of their teachers and the school institution.
This works if parents include respect for their children.
Parents convey this respect more easily if they feel that they are also respected by their children's teachers and schools.
In good institutions, those who make their students progress, parents are regarded as partners, not as emm..
Who can believe that it is the professor who should do all the work (teaching, teaching, learning respect, limits, living together briefly) It is for parents to do at least 50% of the taf.
But it's probably easier to go to school.
Parenting is not operational.
No one really took care of them.
The action will therefore remain limited.
On the other hand, the school institution could do a lot of things.
Operational solutions are based on them.
Should actors (profs, hierarchies and ministry) play their role and do not always play a key role.
A group can be dissolved to re-launch it, not the families.
How not to talk about teaching.
It is true that communication courses allow for change.
It seems that teachers are being trained, but the first role of school is forgotten.
Transfer of knowledge.
And if parents are required, the school will provide instruction for their children.
Which is the Minister who will dare to put in place what was called the Public Instruction.
Defective article: little information, partial and destructive reflections.
Did you really expect an intelligent comment about this beautification of the East Wings?
It's a beaver, it's clear, but I think it's Willoughby, and so on the North Coast...
Sloppy Joe doesn't understand the numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
No wonder we have a budget emergency.
Let him fall and the economy will wake up immediately.
Hunters Hill, actually.

That's it.
A little Aloysius.
Her electorate is the seat of Sydney North.
Really a North Coast beaver !!!
Well, if British BBC TV viewers want to compare the neoconservative governments of our two countries, they would of course conclude that both are led by the Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers.
It goes for a snack, today. :(
Yes, but his leader leaves him regularly on his hunger.
You would be rather rude even if you woke up one morning and realized that you will never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these legitimate and illegal benefits will never remain out of your reach.
Poor Joe.
It's really pathetic.
He tried to present a budget in half and then abandoned it.
At least he doesn't threaten to beat someone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
She will be able to command it, without gas turbines - in a distant country and call for state aid.
And as she knows how to lobby, don't be afraid of the result.
And so much for the job in France that she has nothing to do, she comes out of vegetables always ready to break when their company has losses in the markets, especially outside...
It's just because their lobbying didn't work until the order was cancelled.
If the company had obtained the time or arrangement for marpol, there is no doubt that the project would have come.
Then, to know whether it is good or not and how BF will comply with the law, it would be nice to "the world" to think about it!
Brittany Ferries is held by the Breton vegetables.
Those who burn the tax and drought centers.
They wanted State aid.
That they don't seem to me to be the least normal.
And to the extent that a ship is armed under French Metropolitan flag is 30% cheaper than any other civilized flag, yes, it is normal to wait for a coup d'état.
Or we are condemned to tolerate British monopolies in the market.
It's the choice.
The eternal French problem that considers its maritime façades as tourist destinations, not as areas of activity, where people sometimes live different from the average Parisian.
This difference is paid every day, lack of investment, short-lived.
One of the reasons why Britain must regain its sovereignty.
That's it and then they'll create the Breton Pavilion with exclusive crews made up of pure Bretons.
With this, they're going to make the costs go down significantly...
Of course.
Unfortunately, that is what the BBC now expects.
They always hated everything related to the prog, so it is not surprising that they chose to go beyond Hackett's solo career, which has always been closer to the Genesis spirit of the 1970s than those of the other members of the group.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important it was for the sound, you don't really understand their music.
To tell the truth, they hardly mention Gabriel's work alone anymore.
I do not think that the BBC can be accused of "hate all that relates to the prog," as they have just published an hour and a half documentary on one of the largest prog groups that ever existed.
I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a film about the Genesis group, not about the solo projects of its members.
As for Hackett's solo career, which would be "closer to the Genesis spirit of the 1970s", I disagree.
Hackett no longer has the right to take the road, play a bunch of Genesis songs on which he had different degrees of participation and pretend to have an affinity with Genesis that David Gilmour does not have the right to gather a bunch of half-finished demos and call it a Pink Floyd album.
Oh, wait...
I think Steve Hackett's asking for nothing more than a fair representation, but he didn't get it.
A curious feeling, the first solo album of Bank, is absolutely brilliant, and in fact in the mind of Genesis of the 70s.
They've gone beyond Hackett's solo career because, let's be honest, she's afraid.
Yes, it is one of the best prog groups, but would the documentary have been realized if they had not had their pop commercial success in the 1980s?
I have not yet seen the BBC broadcast a long documentary on groups like King Crimson and Gentle Giant that have as interesting a story but lacks the popular attraction Genesis has.
Good notes.
I would say, however, that the BBC has "always" hated the fact that it ADORRAITs progressive music over time.
A person with a personal interest calls himself "prejudiced": of course.
A little more interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
It's absolutely beautiful song.
If the death penalty is an attempt to redouble an awful act by another horrible act (including sometimes against innocents), then it is a great success.
There will always be a difference in size between a death penalty criminal and those who kill him.
The criminal has committed his act since his false understanding of society and his rules.
Those who kill him do so from the vision and reflection of the most just and wise of a society.
I mean, they don't have any excuses.
They're defenseless.
Yes, we understood your point of view for the first time.
That's exactly where the difference resides, Mr. LeClos.
There must be a very different spirit of the mortal community to enjoy violence.
That's what the criminal's been doing since he got the wrong idea about things.
But it is also what causes pain, hatred, revenge among the relatives of the innocent victim: a false understanding which will never prevail those who wisely decide on the death of others since the healthy and just reasoning of their own homeland.
However, in order to try to balance the analysis, it could even be argued that the death penalty, often committed wild violence, which he was able to enjoy, against people who are very friendly, who have done so for free.
The relatives of these unfortunate victims will eventually be relieved of their pain by the disappearance of the one who has been the drunk, sometimes the tortionaire, of being loved and who spends their nights.
Let us not neglect their relief.
Thank you Emilio for this reflection I find very just.
Article strong and moving.
As for Marc Asnin, he's proof of great intelligence.
That's what's in the heart.
That's certainly what I've been reading for a long time.
It would be believed, however, to read stories from another time, ancient things, that the barbary of the past would excuse, and then that's the dates that are closing, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't think Philip Roth is that great.
Similar to the two other "American Excellent Romanciers" mentioned here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all surfaces.
I thought you stopped the white guy.
What's the big deal?
Roth is great, much better than De Lillo or Pinchon.
And Roth is incredibly better than this poor Bellow, who received his prize.
Perhaps this year's Nobel laureate judges have decided that if we should have an American laureate, we could still have a racist.
Munro's very good, too.
They all produce "geny novels" as if it were a type of literary.
His homonymous Joseph against...
Which one did you read?
How many books from DeLillo did they read?
I never finished Underworld, but a few years later I started reading her other books.
Have you read The Body Artist?
News like "Human Moments in World War III"?
White Noise?
The first lightest novels, the most ugly, the smaller, and their dialogues are also great.
I don't know if I'm going to end up in Underworld.
I just know that if I meet someone who claims to live in the same world as me and have read enough books from DeLillo to reject his writer's talent, I can only fear that his favorite novelist is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be a conflict...??
It's just interest.
It was a sense of humor, "the law", not a definition request.
Between the text and the mind, it seems so EVIDENT here that the lady acted in the SON only interest, and absolutely not in the institution she represented, that we are asked what the term "conflict" is doing there.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope she'll take very expensive!
Yes, State services are very practical: either they prevent a dynamic entrepreneur from creating value, or they have not prevented it from being dangerous.
Then we will understand that the French employees are not dynamic and are only seeking peace.
The flood zones that become constructive the next day when a large construction program is going to start, it's classic, and not just on a low coast.
Look at the alluvial plains near the rivers.
We were told that "of today, there are no more floods due to the regulation barriers".
Now, we need to increase the retention lakes up and cross the fingers.
But this will be due to State services, of course...
The benefit on the ground, on the whole promotion?
On the ground.
So 6 million euros.
Is it clear, here, the interest?
Get out the computer and you're going to dream of the life that you could have been in place of Ms. Babin, the 1st UMP Deputy of La Faute on the Sea and former President of the Committee on Urbanism, who allows them to build!
The 2 females of the Triomphant Sarkozysm are the old and the real estate.
I'm on the left, and I'm not at all sympathetic with Sarko, but svp, not low political or low azimuths, we're not in there in a battle of kicking balls.
I wonder if the cops involved in these recent shootings were also involved in these incidents.
The cops in the United States are tough criminals.
The U.S. is a fucking mess.
So what kind of shit do you want?
The U.S. is not a fucking fool.
Yeah, the American cops are tougher because of the cracks they've been dealing with every day.
Of course none of them ever does anything, but the cops "come to bother them because they're racist."
That's a good excuse.
Racism is endemic in the United States, it is unfortunate that there is an incident like this that will force people to see the problem as close as possible.
Your generalization reveals a deep ignorance of the US...
You don't know him here.
The good cops must denounce the corrupt racist cops.
VENDEZ LESS!
Do the math.
This kind of open racism doesn't exist here.
Is this the first time you've had a conversation?
It's not a conversation, you accuse someone of being ignorant while in fact it's you who clearly don't mind - many sources (US sources) have noticed the eternal problem that racism in the United States (it's not from osculating).
It is highly likely that you underestimate the extent of the problem and do not appreciate the extent to which the tension arises in this regard at this time.
As a result, the border between public service and private security for power and privileges, which has never been very robust, becomes even more insignificant.
Wall Street finances the NYPD in different ways, from where the treatment received by Occupy there.
What surprises me is the naïveness of some and I am shocked by the false naïveness of VA and others.
And where do you think the investigation reporters find their information?
On the Internet?
They're going to question those responsible, make them talk, raise confidence.
That Lhomme is going to Elisea has nothing really surprising.
Then, what counts is cutting, checking, analysis.
And that's where it's understood that sarcastics care about themselves.
@Munstead, our current president has been elected on a wave of anti-narcosysm based on cases of any kind (no place and no conviction) that appear to have been concocted by magistrates (2 sent in corrigendum), two Dutch friends.
If this collision that is revealed between justice, politics, executive and the press that is not supposed to be a power organ does not shock you, it is your partisan spirit that blinds you!
RV with Holland ...
And of course all this is only coincidence and not remote!!!! ...
If you think only Sarkozy's supporters are angry!
From the extract I could read, the VA article just scratches the scratcher.
I even laughed so big.
For the rest, the world's complaint has little chance of reaching because journalists are not "attended" in the secret of sources, is it not?
Unlike the fact that there does not seem to be any consensus between VA and power, there seems to be a convergence between the power and the world's journalists for an operation against an opponent.
I do not have to be the only one to wait for an explanation from the world on the ground and on its dangerous relations.
We are well in the face of a state scandal that in any other democracy would cause the fall of the government involved.
This editorial for the aboises, which is long about complicity with the current government.
It's not a left or right question, it's more serious.
I'd have thought the bird would go well with the smoked hare! <*))))))<<<
It is just for the figures and to reduce wages and create housing problems, I am sure that if I were an immigrant of the second generation, whose life was pleasant, because my parents had come here, I would have doubts about the question of immigration, but that is not a reason to oppose controls.
One of the most sensitive people in a BBC issue on immigration was a second-generation Sik who said that she was comfortable with the number of people coming in and the changes they made with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not of all co-operating, even refusing to give soup jokes simply because of the lady's religion, he also refused to enter her place of worship although she claimed that he was not obliged to pray.
** "who said she wasn't at ease"
As we all know, if we let it go, the United Kingdom will continue to go right - whoever imposes limits and answers that must be admired even if he is a director of the public:) So much better for you!
More to the right?
Where do you live?
If this country were more left-handed, it would be Communist.
According to you, what did New Labour do, especially on the left?
The liberalisation of a country, the NHS of this NHS is a repetition, the massive immigration of immigrants (according to their own terms for the well-being of the right hand), the culture of social benefits, the age of all-permit, the right policy that kills freedom of expression.
I understand that Labour is a left-handed and non-communist centre, I said this to be a joke, which I mean is that they have socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them dependent on the State.
It's typical of the left, if you want my opinion.
Leave your prepared arguments as much as you like, but what I asked you is examples of the Gaussian policy, or a left-wing program advocated by the New Labour Government.
Can you do that?
With all due respect, that's not what you asked, you asked Daniel Johnson what he thought the New Labour had done, which is particularly right.
He gave you his advice, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you asked for.
Yeah, it's more of Tim Bell's territory.
So Martin Sorrell, the most powerful advertising director in the United Kingdom, associates the situation of his parents with the economic migrants who are coming to Britain now?
What an insult to their memory!
He was absolutely right to do so.
France to the French!
It was beaten in 40 45 to fall into another discount, the one of the money.
We'll make nice savings by turning these technocrats...
We should renegotiate the treaties.
So, what if the word "democracy" has another meaning in Europe, should it not?
Interestingly, the Commission does not consider unfair tax competition between companies.
That must be a negligible amount.
Europe is not the solution, it is the problem...
The EU has only one objective: to make the rail transport sector fully marketable.
In the end, this means that all pans of the French territory will no longer be served by rail.
The abandonment that has already been caused by many territories will only strengthen itself.
All to sacrifice, including the advance of a country, on behalf of the liberal doxa did not seem to me to be a good idea.
The EU is a real problem that will have to deal well with one day.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means to clarify the SNCF accounts.
The French state has for a long time resigned.
Regions have the impression to pay for nothing, but not the means to force the sncf to comply with its commitments.
But using public money without spending is essential today when public resources are forced.
And the great needs.
I don't see very well what the TER competition could be!
Does he still have a problem with alcohol?
If that's the case, shouldn't he be the head of the cheerleaders?
It seems to me that you have not really managed to distinguish the problems that existed during the marriage and that you are, of course, always coming to an end of pain and anger now that more than five years have passed.
Obviously, having an ex-alcoholic life so close to you and having what seems to be a daily impact on your life is annoying and very difficult.
That said, it would seem to me that the process of separation between your life and the complications that you have inherited.
It looks like that's what they're doing, but it's kind of hostile to me.
Since you all live so close to each other and that complications seem likely to persist while new ones surface, have you thought about a "plan" of "flee" so that you can cut between your life and your future?
Financial problems have an adverse effect, but with a compassionate real estate credit company, a good lawyer and a little pressure on the part of the court, they can be resolved.
He has vindictive and persistent air.
Why not go to a Family Advisory Group to say things openly and offer support to help him to resume work and pay the food pension.
I think that's the key.
Your life is made of much more things than the time you've spent with your ex.
Very good advice.
My advice, ask the children what they would like to do, even if this involves meeting the new woman.
Tell them that you will support their choice whatever it is.
Warn them that it will not necessarily keep his promises regarding contact and ask them to reflect on how it would make them feel and how they will manage disappointment if they do not meet.
Try to keep in touch with their father.
If they see that you do this for their good, despite your own feelings because of the way he treated you, they will respect you.
They will never cease to love you and if you do all you can to facilitate a continuous parent/child relationship, they will know who to thank when they are older.
I am of the opinion that children end up understanding who is wrong, if we let them see things by themselves.
You're close to the Godwin point.
In the next 30 to 40 years, civilisation will have disappeared, economic interests in the short term are too powerful, the ground pot against the iron pot.
Moreover, with globalization, the country that makes at least so-called social, fiscal and environmental benefits has a competitive advantage, and the others are forced to follow.
All politicians are looking for is growth, Growth.
It would take international coordination, but from here...
These are not climateceptics that produce C02.
It is everyone who warms up, those who use the climate, those who take the plane or car, those who live in homes that it has to build, those who buy industrial products that it has to produce and transport.
It's not the climateceptics that showed up against the ecotax, but the truckers.
No policy is climate change and Arnold S consumes much more than I do.
But no one says that climateceptics emit more than CO2 than others.
Environmental defenders also move to conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they count, will not suffice.
Political actions (other sources of energy, reduced dependence on cars, etc.) are also needed.
And politicians act in part according to the sensitivities of their electorate.
"I'll be back" is in fact a famous promise by McArtur made on March 11, 1942 at his departure from the Philippines.

Bingo of the Guardian: How long before someone makes a mistake about immigration?
I blame the crap that took all the money.
Do we count Liberia in Texas?
You're Rick Perry and I'm demanding my $5.
I'm making a mistake about the MPs.
Or the democrats.
Or the workers' liars.
We're wrong, they're responsible.
The displacement of populations could be a real aspect of this epidemic.
Asymptomatic or subclinical cases that jump into a car or a plane to escape the epidemic are only to move the infection faster than they can imagine.

False, actually!
Don't use the word immigration, you're going to scare the horses!
The United Kingdom depends on immigration to pay all our retirements, to take care of our old people, to empty their hygienic pools, to bury 30,000 people who die each year of hypothermia or hunger, (do not forget your wool and doll, which allows you to warm up, to extinguish the heat and to eat this sandwich to cheese).
Don't be like that.
Uncontrolled and untested immigration will lead Ebola to Europe and the rest of the world.
Is it a lie or is it not explicit?
It's more comfortable...
This is how public money is spent to allow a small minority of people to spend a good time in space to make cockpits and run around while playing clowns in front of TV cameras.
The reality television has therefore not invented anything, and the authorities are sure to expect a baby to be designed up there to burn the world and strip off the media coverage of Western kings who are used to the motherhood of tabloids.
They may have to go back to the ground to find that we're here!
Unlike what you seem to believe, we don't send men or women into space to make choppers or clowns, but to work.
And this work is very useful for mankind in general.
And that, in all areas.
Many things that improve our daily lives are from space research.
So, yeah, it's money that's worth it.
You can quote one thing that improves our daily life and results from space research.
It's just a cold fries.
the billy style that works the point in the air (for writing to the ceiling, for example)

To participate in the manufacture of a single useless product?
Or suggest how to make more money for investors?
In short, working to work doesn't mean anything and represents the vacuum itself.
Ah if the last high tech game.
Behind the infinite minority of people who go into space, there are several tens of thousands of others who work to make this possible.
You know, people who drink what, including more and more private companies, especially to take the load to the station.
If you're going to buy a plastic gun...
But what about those who don't want to buy plastic gun now but who have the potential to buy it in the future?
Maybe they're the most dangerous of all.
Not because the plastic sword was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to impress people to make them believe that it is a real gun used to commit a crime.
Plastic swords may be kitsch decorations, but nothing else.
A very dishonest article would have hurt the author/editor rather than put a picture of the "spouse" in question instead of generic photos of "spouse in plastic"?
Or even be curious enough to wonder what the registration (if any) was about?
A typical bad report, it is expected that "it is only a plastic sword" and not on the inspired jihad text that is written on it.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of Shiite Islam.
The Dirani family, on the other hand, is a Muslim Shiite born in Afghanistan, terrorist groups seeking to overthrow the Governments in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims.
If only people stopped laughing at the fact that plastic knives were harmless.
In the hands of a skilled man, they can be mortal.
Even the small envelopes we give in the quick remnants can lose the flesh.
Thank you very much for this info, so if it is a common decorative object, it justifies the ridicule the author gives it.
It's not worth trying to make a "ha, ha, a plastic sword," the facts as you have mentioned actually support his argument.
I saw these decorative objects on the occasion in Muslim houses, or painted on the walls, they never had a threatening appearance, just another version of a "cross".
Jesus, you're right.
And that makes all its sense now...
I saw this guy who seemed to be from the Middle East in Kebab Stop and who was distributing plastic knives to anyone all night long!
I like the conclusion very much.
All the amazing innovations, often technologically, make many people think that it is a right and a need to benefit from them, but they have an immediate and worse cost, a stable cost (subscription, electricity consumption) that is in the budgets.
And the impossibility of taking advantage of new technologies is the result of frustration.
For example, use the Energy Solidarity Pact, which allows to isolate the sets of a home for 1€ symbolically when it is inhabited by a modest household (the cost of work is actually borne by energy suppliers!).
Simple but not known even though more than 3,000 houses have been so isolated this year!
This is an interesting PES.
But I've never heard of it.
Who can call and how does it work?
for information 60 million consumers, test water-economy showers and recommend the placing of water-economy equipment on taps and toilets.
The study shows that a family of 4 can reduce its water bill by 30% (from 150 m3 to 100 m3) or 50 m3 of water economy per year, while maintaining the same comfort.
This is not a crisis in demand, it is a crisis in the system that can no longer produce enough surpluses (which would then have been redistribution in the form of income increases in real terms) so that these surpluses pay the increase in the expenditures you rank in the category "compulsory expenditures".
In other words, energy caution is "just" the reverse of the medal because the economy can't grow as fast as it would like.
Note that the (neo-)classical theory of the economy is totally unable to answer such a question, because for it, there is no intrinsic limit to economic growth, and there is no element that can force, more and more and more decades after, the pace of economic growth.
By its very definition (in physical terms), energy is what allows for any physical transformation.
As production is essentially transforming, energy is a means of achieving the least economic production (good or service).
And the more we want to produce, the more energy we need.
This means that any pressure on energy gain (inaccurately called "production" of energy), even in the form of an increase in its price, imposes on its turn production (except for improving energy efficiency, but improving energy efficiency always requires heavy investments, which are not profitable if energy is not expensive enough).
In short, there is a very strong link between energy concerns and the fact that we arrive, or not, to increase the "production" of expensive energy.
And the data published very officially, for example by the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation will only worsen over the years and decades to come (the AIE, in recent reports, clearly indicates that the peak of conventional oil production was reached in 2008 and that oil was not cheap.
But oil is the most universal form of energy, due to its very strong energy density, its transport and handling and storage facilities, its possible range of uses, etc.)
Three points, good work whatever performance.
It was a good performance in Germany, and nothing has been done so it equalises things.
Take it from France!
Vote No 18.
Are you a Webmaster of the Guardian?
As noted earlier: It's good to win.
It's good to win.
Well, it's a good job for the guys.
Although many English people like to mock the Scottish when they do nothing but lose, there is no point in saying, they bring a little color to the tournaments when they get to qualify, at least until they get rid of themselves in the first round.
It's even more rigid if we play against them;)
England's starting to worry me.
Because, now that the Golden Shige Generation withdraws, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
Ferdinand, D.
Betty, Joe Cole and David Seamen back in the early XI, why change a team that wins?
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been an "international class", is David Beckham, a bit effeminate, perhaps, but I think that if he touched a potato in superweights like me, he would totally crush me.
People forget their athletic constitution, by the way, talking about athletic constitution in sports, Wayne Rooney...?
I never mock the Scottish.
I tend to surprise myself by observing their warm colors with nostalgia at the end of the evening...
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been "international class", is David Beckham
Yes, people often seem to forget that it was, at its best, a very good player.
It is that Juppe would be wrong to ask for 100000 euros for a conference in South Korea.
And not that he would get them if he asked them...
Are you saying people come to make a good turn?
For the rest, I'd be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, lives only on his fellow Members' compensation...
I would like to ask myself, above all, what he can tell us at his conferences.
How do you reduce your deficit?
How to get back to full employment?
I would say that no serious lecturer of scientific discipline, whatever its scientific level, even if he is the holder of a Nobel prize, will think of asking for the lowest amount.
Conferences with content are mostly free or almost free time.
And I can assure you that these young people really work and that the results presented in their free conferences are real.
At the time of the restrictions on the research budget, the reporting of these two figures is satisfactory.
The researchers' conferences are even paid by the lab!!!
That's to say...
It's all coming out for me.
They look at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a worthy representative of the ethics of the UMP
I feel like we blame him for making money?
I'm far from being one of his fans, but we blame him for having wrong (or fraudulently) managing his OK campaign.
But holding conferences seems to me to be a legitimate activity.
To add to Nina's comment, let's remember that her movements are taken care of by taxpayers.
Rule No.1 of epidemiology: isolate.
All U.S. and British flights to or from Africa should have been suspended weeks ago.
Human life is more important than right politics.
It is present in Spain, GB, Texas and other potential places.
What is the population's infection density that politicians will resolve to make the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the United Kingdom, I take the plane for Spain, and then I take a plane from Spain to the United Kingdom.
If Ebola invades West Africa, I see them forbid all flights and ships in the direction of the United Kingdom.
We'd always need to send some goods, that says...
What a shame that the panic of international media about Ebola is no longer used to talk about less spectacular but more deadly health crises affecting West Africans.
We're all threatened.
In every corner of the world, men and women. It's a news article so sad, a big title so low.
I could read each paragraph and replace the word Men in other contexts (as well as relevant): Women are the first caregivers of care - read - Men travel from one community to another, etc.
Such smarter comments could have been made on the ways, reasons and places where we can all contribute to a better understanding and interpretation of cultural and sociological approaches, and the differences in the role of sex that could help fight Ebola in West Africa.
Come on, let's think about it and write, we're not happy to make a noise.
There's a moment for everything.
If you are not able to offer a good analysis and an intelligent opinion, maybe you should just think before writing?
Although I would put female genital mutilation on the same rank as decapitation - a form of terrorism as barbarous, its survival rate by making only a different form of torture - says that its temporary suspension is a "light of hope" beyond understanding.
In fact - I see that the contributor is Sierra Leone, which can give a certain degree of "validity" to his opinion, but in this case it certainly does not give a better perspective than that of an average activist in the street.
And I believed that the Guardian was being "murdered" as a global resource of journalism - moving forward in the 21st century, leaving its founding precepts.
Who, in the editorial team, let this show up?
For a territorial or other election, money does not count.
I constantly read that the territorial public service is increasing its staff, and I have never seen an article giving them the floor or trying to explain why.
It would be legitimate, indeed.
There will be no doubt lies and truths to separate us from the good seed of the Jew.
The court of accounts costs so much to tell so many economic nuisances.
It's true that they've never had anything to do with the people on Cambon Street.
CTs are not in a deficit with funding needs that can only relate to investments they make.
It is necessary to use too vague concepts of the press as the World makes the game of all the obscurants.
Debt benefits as it finances investment, collective property
Unfortunately, debt financing, especially operating costs...
And as the suffocation of officials (to make beautiful round-points, for example) leads to a growing and uncompromising burden (compulsory burden up to their death, as living and retirement work), these communities are cutting in investment.
It is therefore necessary to delete the staff member's status, in advance of the decrease in the number of staff.
And also responsible the mayors financially.
It is fabulous that the intercoms should be accompanied by a decrease in the Community's workforce and that is the opposite, it proves that adding a step is not effective without the removal of others.
How do you want to manage large territories properly like peanuts at the time of the TGV and the car?
The time of the horse in which these territories were created is revolutionized, perhaps it would be time to react.
They would not prefer to remain in prison, worse incarceration, in the administrative framework, would he stop!
Let's try even scratched, it's not too strong to explain the blocking situation to which Veme's condition has led with its providential men.
It really started with Petin.
Then he went on to get to the series "at the end of the breath" that came strong on this matter.
Why are they not going to live in a $250 million apartment in Monaco above a movie to leave all this suffering behind them?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, it will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Don't even try the answers of the kind "it's the fault of the whites."
"answers" not "answers"
I sincerely hope it's sarcasm.
It was in my previous post, in case it wasn't obvious enough.
That's what happens when we hurry to be the first.
Whether it's sarcasm or not, there's an argument to be made.
It is now agreed that modern Homo Sapiens evolved in North-East Africa about 200 thousand years ago, and during a particularly wet period about 150 thousand years ago they managed to travel to the North to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least eight thousand years) is part of history.
The current Minister of Defence said a few months ago that no military hospital would stop.
So he's lying.
It was no doubt the only government that seemed to keep the road.
Now, we know we can't trust him anymore.
Disfellowshipping!
in 2017:Transformation in a comfortable special hotel of gold placards for future retrievals of the Republic ?
Moving the floor dedicated to Bercy?
Very good decision: the Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a medicine for Nantis and their families, the care "Grand V" of a 3-speed medicine.
We're going to save money, and the soldiers are going to take care of the little flu elsewhere...
Do you know that 70% of the patients are civilians, of all horizons?
The London Wasps?
I'm sorry about their fans that are based in Wycombe/London.
Like the London Irish and the London Welsh?
They left the "London" last season.
It's just the "wasps" now.
A franchise of any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, aren't they?
It changes that a football team uses the field of a rugby club instead of the reverse.
In addition, external movements for Tigers and Saints will be much easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
At Stockport County, we had the chance to be bought by the Sharks Sales, and we ended up renting our own stadium with them once we found our independence.
I was gonna say the same thing.
The way in which they insisted on training in the field, although they had access to other places, has not done us any favors.
I love supporting Coventry City.
The good news doesn't stop.
There's always the possibility of a Coventry United now.
It must be frustrating for a team that has no bad supporters and that has been on top for more than 30 years, to see its stage taken by a rugby club.
I'm aware of the recent issues of the CCFC, but that must be a good guess.
For me, I'm not the club's rugby, and to be honest, I don't know anyone who does it except for some folks from the Wasps at work.
Are they and a few thousand other people in the South-East likely to follow them away or are they going to have to support another team now?
Nice pro-domo article and good vulgarization.
But who cares?
But then why not all computer systems are based on these concepts?????
+because there is a huge mass of pre-existing programs (cobol, java), +because all systems don't need them, +because there is no magic baguette ++....
And because for most computer systems, bugs are not really important, what counts is to be the first on the segment.
The work of G.

Mr. Gérard Berry.
We should constantly (media) of such characters, who work for the good of mankind.

But they don't sell.
Real time computer technology has become a key sector in many areas, and few are those who know the intimate details of this process.
15 years ago I didn't go to an Olive Garden.
The quality-price ratio has decreased.
I'm sorry for those who're going to lose their job, but it's better than closing the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices of which popularity is known.
Reduce costs and prices.
There is already too much salt in our diets.
Don't ask Olive Garden not to put salt in the future.
They seem to reason with more profits, and not healthier dishes and the best quality-price ratio.
They're taking us for pies.
Oh, yeah, be careful people didn't have too much grass.
And then let's make our soup by someone else, it's better when it's industrial.
Make sure there's salt in there, it replaces the real ingredients.
We should also add some sodium glutamate.
The amount of salt you need to add to the water of the pasta is negligible, but this greatly enhances the taste of the finished product.
It is not only the taste of salt, it also affects the way the pastes cook.
The finished product is so much better.
Without salt, there's no food.
Everyone should try alternatives to the business kitchen.
Are there any family restaurants and are they offering tasty dishes at reasonable prices?
What is happening in the United States is very sad.
A banal accident from work that went wrong.
A young promiser, learned to steal, followed his father’s career in prison for murder.
A man has all torn up and brutally interrupted this vocation of birth.
If he is sentenced to 10 years in prison, he appears to be the least.
Where else is he?
All right!
What a humour!
The desire to decide is obviously and hardly excusable and reprehensible at all...
The desire to decide is, in effect, difficult to excuse.
That's what makes me have some sympathy for a 15-year-old.
During the trial, the boy's father complained that he would never see his son again, but without asking for forgiveness for the kind of guy he killed himself.
Who's really the victim in this story?
What do you come to mix everything!!!?
The boy's father was condemned for what he did.
With regard to the matter of the lost ball, the accused and guilty, he knew quite well that the ball was dangerous.
The guy didn't do anything to the defendant!
So let him pay for the crime he is responsible for!
10 years old, it's a little too much in my opinion.
For having the intelligence to pull this young man to make noise?
Actually, that's the noise!
If the opportunity arises, take a vacation in the Mosul valley and sleep in the B&B of one of the small winemakers.
It's been twice that I do it, wine, landscape and food are excellent.
Moreover, if you are there during one of the many wine festivals held in each municipality, it is even better.
Excuse me, Moselle Valley, I'm stuck too fast.
It is a pleasure to see that the German wine is recognized.
Rather important, the German vineyards traditionally use only one variety of grapes, which means that they really have to push hard to preserve a certain quality.
Of course, some young generations experience different grapes, such as France, Italy, etc.
There is only one region of the Moselle that must be recommended - France, the Palatinate Rhenan (Pfalz), Baden deserves to be visited.
A French region of interest is Alsace, which is like a mixture between Germany and France.
The wines are German-style (or maybe it's the reverse, briefly).
The Germans prefer beer.
Traditionally, they drink the wine after the meal.
Knowing the popularity of dry whites during the meal, they now offer a lot, and with a much higher alcohol content than their favorite 9 degrees.
But their traditional wines put in bottle at the property are so complex, mildness is perfectly balanced.
Try Schloss Vollrad's spatles with a thermodor lobster next time you go to the rest.
Search Hallgarten online for a good selection.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
Hugh Johnston's World Atlas of Wine is a great guide, beautifully illustrated.
I understand well that there will be new readers of the Guardian who discover the wine, but this is a recap of every newspaper article on German wine since the night of time.
From time to time, there is an article on the German wines that are about to arrive, the new drys of Baden that are going to accompany the dishes, the reds that are amazingly strong, but above all, it is not these Liebfraumilch disgusting that people were drinking when they were young (heu, I don't really think it's always true or speaker, unless I address myself to over 40 years - who, as I say, will already have seen all this).
Closing the Val de Grace would be a huge mistake and an illustration of the sad state in which the French Administration is.
A crime against Louis XIV and a thorn in the foot of my great-father and my great-grand-uncle who have studied it.
In democracy, public health management should be submitted to the vote of the House of Deputies: these departmental chamailleries held by the barbichette, and these closed-house decisions, have become unbearable.
Sorbogroin's right.
It should be done as in Soleil Vert: euthanasia at 70 years of age.
In addition, we could resell the meat that will feed our poor active poor (sic) as they can no longer go to the market.
In fact, find work for our unemployed, for real work, and you will no longer have problems with deficits!
For the elderly, it is time to pay a little more because national solidarity is no longer able to provide...
Assets, by way of disappearance, will not only be able to hold this demographic transition...
So of the geriatrics, of course, but to think otherwise than a hospital model of the 30 gloriouss.
Now, the maximum growth of 1.5% (this has already been the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will force us to rethink the whole model defined after the war!
Val de Grace is the symbol of medical excellence in France: a certain rigour and discipline we knew more in public hospital.
If this symbol falls, we're really wrong.
First, we were wrong because the rest of the hospitals aren't high.
The scandal is that the presidents and other elites are being cared for elsewhere than in the public hospital.
The solution is more in the increase in public service in other hospitals than to maintain a two-speed medicine.
The Val is a French medical excellence pool, and of course a symbol.
The closure would be a mistake, a sign of more going to France's mediocrit.
Not to mention military status, which must be preserved absolutely.
"The Hospitalization Day Award", a hospital management unit, is decided by the department with local supervision of the Regional Hospitalization Agencies.
The abolition of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, of course the baby is just one of those economic refugees, he came to Australia to have a better paid job than the one he had at home.
In almost every country in the world, a child born in that country of two non-citizens is almost always non-citizen.
Australia goes further than most countries by giving birth to children born to Australian citizens.
But it is Australia that is criticised because it does not meet some outstandingly high standards, with obvious difficult consequences.
Why?
It seems to me that two weights are two measures.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, to end all the persecution and ill-treatment and war that make people of their countries flee and force them to come for help in Australia.
If he doesn't want people to come by ship, then we need to solve the problem of this traffic.
I don't have to complain about life in Sri Lanka today.
The civil war lasted 26 years, tens of thousands of people died on both sides.
That's what happens during civil wars.
However, the war ended 6 years ago and the country returned to normal.
It all makes sense now, nimrod!
Strange that British Prime Minister David Cameron didn't believe in this little superhero when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr. Abbott...
Cameron denounced the war crimes and ill-treatment that were still taking place.
Several European countries have since suspended the deportations of the Tamouls with links to the LTTEs, thinking they would be at risk of torture on their return.
UNHCR revised its guidelines for the assessment of asylum applications in December 2012, and recommended that persons with links to LTTEs be considered at risk of their return.
The year [2013] saw a rise in attacks by Buddhist militant groups against Hindus and Muslims.
The elections for three provincial councils took place in September.
All late, boys!
Mr. Novak, you've had your coconut all the time.
And in fact, this guy couldn't get even a chance to make it.
He didn't have a health insurance in the States?
So he would've given any treatment.
I would like to know who is going to pay for the medical expenses during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas perhaps, unless some lab pay for the purchase of the body?
In the US, the rule is cash first, help come later.
Specially in Texas
Ah ah ah!!!!!!!!!!!!
We were told that the Ebola killed so quickly that a large-scale epidemic was impossible (there is a whole scientific literature on the issue, with models and everything).
We were then told that the risk of contagion of missing persons was zero.
I'm afraid the more we get, the more I'm scared.
You need to read some newspaper jokes to believe that a risk can be zero.
Low or three, but not zero.
Finally, c is a scientific reality, more a virus is deadly quickly (generally) less likely to spread because the death of the host signes its own death.
The combination of 2 (high transmission and rapid death) sometimes comes from the Spanish flu.
After c is the 40th general to save humanity. ..
There is nothing in the way of putting certain brave and vertebrate Western media ahead, but to the detriment of thousands of other African patients who were not familiar with the trade, the bravery or the vertebrates?
This, of course, highlights the action of NGOs and encourages them to help, but the repetition of the ads is a horrifying partisanity.
Freedom of expression, so much loved by conservatives.
The suspension was to keep the doctors under control.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott, brothers of weapons attacking freedom of expression and the right to the private life of Australians.
I bet they never imagined that their conservative pens would have robbed them of their rights to freedom of expression.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott,
I bet there's someone who won't do it next time.
Yes, that is exactly what we need right now, less health professionals available during a potential health crisis.
A heat tour for when the problem really becomes out of control.
There are already not enough doctors working in the regions around Australia like this.
Tony Abbott's refusal to take part in the "war" against Ebola illustrates his philosophy about medical challenges.
The Joe Hockey Plan for a New Markets Fund for Medical Research, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020, is likely to be just a black emergency cash for the budget.
Using the pretext of the noble medical research, he will collect $20 billion and, at a later date, transfer these funds as general income.
I hope that the Australian voters will see this excellent Russian for what it is.
Tony Abbott is much smarter than we want to believe it.
He explains that the sale of Medibank Private is compensated by the Termination Markets Fund for Medical Research.
However, it is a loss for the sick, a loss for the elderly and a loss for the poor.
It may be very intelligent, but it's not fair.
Finally, the "misleading predator" and its Telstra Markets Fund were excellent tutors.
If that's not fair, then we'll show Abbott who's smart.
Send him to hell at the next election.
The most terrible thing for Nadine is still the "old personality", funny....
I also noticed it, quite corrosive as a remark.
If only she could deter her from keeping a buzz on it all the time.
The worst fate for a career end-of-life policy: not recognized in the street.
Hello She was not recognized in her town of Toul as being high enough to administer it.
How good is the good sense of "in Provincial"!
We've been living a long time, Ma'am Morano.
I'm sure I'm against the port of the burqa, but that's not the point.
What this anecdotes relates is sarcosm to pure state: of mediocre minors with rank of ministers, a confusion between the function of government and the function of execution (if Sarkozy could come with his tonfa on every accent of the road to show that he is well-guarded of the public order), the grossness and inequity brought to their maximum degree.
I propose that the right to Morano, Sarkozy and all these "former personalities" be given the right to carry a firearm and a badge, which would thus have the pleasure of exercising their self-proclaimed role as judges.
But who's Nadine Romano?
It is indeed the main teaching of the case: even the police have turned the Sarkozy page, perhaps they do not regret it.
He really has to stop before it gets embarrassing to him.
I'm sending this agent who ignored the existence of Nadine Morano, if only I could do the same...
like bob, for the blow
Don't you agree, thanks to her we're doing well...!
Nadine, if she didn't exist, you'd have to invent it!
It's easy, though, it looks like Christine Boutin with a blonde wig.
Over and over, N.
Morano manifestly did indeed in contempt, in the contempt of the police officer she had in front of her, and who would certainly have had to multiply the curvettes and the "Yes Madame, of course Madame, immediately, Madam, tell me in which direction I must run to catch me without waiting for this veiled woman."
"In one case, the Australian Super Hornets abandoned an air attack on a target of Isis when the risk of killing civilians became too important... ".
The Americans are not bad at this, but I think that Isis is going to exceed or have already done it, in Iraq at least someone was counting the bodies right now.
In the case of industrial civilian deaths, nothing rivals with the Western war machine.
I disagree that the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (including non-Western) between the two wars of Iraq would have cost millions of Iraqis, particularly children, elderly persons and vulnerable adults.
Most of the anti-war demonstrators I knew would prefer sanctions to the "war machine" discharge.
Are you also the kind of guy who would prefer sanctions to the order and men on the ground?
Very good comment - the United Nations has acted incredibly hard and unconcerned over the past few years.
Penalties are generally ineffective and cannot reach the elite - no doubt one reason why they have the occasional approval of the so-called Security Council.
You may remember that the insurgents did not waste time marking their main enemy when they saw it in the recent war in Iraq.
It was the attack on the United Nations Mission's QG that they raised just five days earlier in Baghdad in 2003.
They hit this place with force and twice, and I imagine with satisfaction and cold blood.
So brutal and harsh is this bombing, I was surprised by the shock of people to know that a United Nations mission has been targeted like this.
Well, I actually forgot about that.
So add one and a half million people to the total number of deaths of Western nations (at least with the recent disturbances in Ukraine, economic activity was directed directly to the people they intended to hurt).
This only helps your argument to exacerbate potentially unreliable statistics.
Even vaguely reliable figures on sanctions deaths are those of children under the age of 5 and they are even very suspicious as Saddam Hussain has refused to allow objective inspectors to detect the facts.
It was obviously in his interest to exacerbate the negative effects of sanctions.
The most reliable estimate is that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 200,000 and 400,000, but no one really knows.
As for additional deaths in other age groups, estimates are no better than assumptions.
Since the number of pre-trial deaths in less than five years was about 10 times worse than in the United Kingdom, for example, it is possible that the number of post-trial deaths is largely partial to this age group.
Of course you should be afraid of it, but also of the gift of gametets in general.
It must be stopped to act as if people were pure spirits, that love was all that children needed, and that we could do it with strangers that neither parent nor child may ever know, without consequences for them.
One of our founding myths is Oedipus, 60% of the French are from genology.
It is an essential and neglected thing to know its origins.
Instead of acting as if it were obvious and using fantastic arguments, we should explain what serious problems can arise for an adopted child or conceived with a gift of gamma.
If you learn that the parents who raised you did not provide the jokes you have come out of, you could return them, in my opinion, because they would have committed no crime.
The latest advances of the LDCs (e.g. uterine scratches) are at least as controversial as a reasonably framed GPA.
The real question seems to me to be: does the frustration of the desire of children justify these acrobaties and has nothing to do with marriage for all.
Very just as a point.
It's obvious that we have to be afraid of the GPA, which is what this stupid question is.
Of course, it's sad that you can't have children when you want them.
It's a problem I've had with my wife.
But anyway, it's less serious than being born very disabled or becoming, contracting a serious illness, losing all his children in an accident, etc.
Of all the concerns of life, this is not the most serious.
It's a frustration among many others.
That doesn't stop you from living.
And we can always take care of the children of others!
In a society that no longer supports any form of frustration, where the child becomes a good consumer, the GPA is unacceptable to me.
The desire of a child is not a capricious one where the other can be used according to his or her wishes.
Sterility requires reflection and acceptance.
