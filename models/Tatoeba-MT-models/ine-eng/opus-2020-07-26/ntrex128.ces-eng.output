The members of the local assembly are afraid that they will “seem to be Mupeti”
Some of the members of the House of Commons are consterated on the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the House of Commons)
For the purpose of the proposal, plans are to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
In contrast to the political spectrum, members of the assembly are afraid that the name may be a joke.
One member of the Labour Party stated that his group was concerned that "it was held with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In tupp power means stupid and pwp means shit.
A member on the part of Plaid said that the group as a whole "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
The Dutch Conservative stated that his group was coming to change the name "with open mind", but noted that MWP was close to Muppet's word.
In this context, the English word "w" is similar to the word "u" in Yorkshire.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is now preparing legislation to introduce amendments to the name, stated: "The final decision on what will be called the members of the Belgian assembly will, of course, be on the members themselves."
The Law of the Polish Government of 2017 gave the Polish Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on proposals, where broad support was given the option of calling the assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the assembly, the Commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP option received the highest support in the public debate.
The members of the meetings clearly propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus can bring the concerns of President Elin Jones, who will have to submit a legislative proposal within a few weeks.
Reform laws will include further changes in the functioning of the assembly, including rules for the disqualification of members and the draft committee system.
The members of the assembly shall vote on their title in the course of the discussion of the new legislation.
Macedonians are going to vote on the country's name change
On Sunday, voters will decide whether their country's name will be changed to "the Republic of North Macedonia".
A separate vote should resolve ten years of ongoing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long been insisting that the name of the northern neighbour represents a claim in the Greek territory and repeatedly protests against the request for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is a proponent of the plebiscite for a change of name, has announced that he will not vote.
The representatives of the referendum, including the President of Zoran Zaeva, argue, however, that the change of name is simply a price for entry into the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's will be silenced because the churches in Harlem are fighting for survival
"The old people I spoke to say that there was a bar and church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"There's nothing there today."
He thinks the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People meet today in a different way," he says.
"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly walk."
As for the churches, I fear that the money from the sale of the property will not be enough for as long as their representatives expect, "and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started."
As he adds, the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of people who do not help the remaining saints in the quarter.
"The simple majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white," he says, "and that is why the day will soon come when these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into the apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original white - language Methodist congregation was moved in the 1930 ’ s.
She took over the construction of the Black Congregation, whose religious activities were not far away.
St. Martin took over the Montenegrin Congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who stood in front of the retailer's boycott on 125th Street, the main buying bullvary in Harlem, who refused to hire or raise blacks.
The fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when the Pharaohs of Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered the bell tower.
Reverend David Johnson, son of the father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin, proudly called the bells of the poor.
The expert who played the bell game in July called it "cultural treasure" and "an irrevocable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first ring game in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger ring in the church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says that no one has betrayed him at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, the story of architects and designers at St. Martin’s has been a complicated story, some of which have been called the late church representatives, and others of the episcopal diocese.
The council of elders, the leading authority of the parish, consisting of secular representatives, sent a letter in July expressing concern that the diocese would "try to pay the costs" to the council of the elders, although the hiring of architects and designers who sent the diocese did not participate at all.
Some farmers complained about insufficient transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark injured a 13-year-old boy in California who drowned for humrs.
According to the official report, the shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy who drowned in California for lobster on the day of the start of the lobster season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near the Beacon's Beach beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that on Saturday morning, he and his friends had drowned for about half an hour when he heard the boy calling for help, and then he joined the whole group to help him pull him out of the water.
Hammel pointed out that the call first considered the joy of catching lobster, but then “you realized that he was shouting, ‘ Shoot me!
Shoot me!'
When Hammel got to the boy, he noticed that “he had broken the entire area of the key bone.”
"I cried that everyone would go out of the water: ‘In the water is a frog!’” Hammel added.
The boy was in critical condition transported by helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council Hospital in San Diego.
It's not known what kind of shark is behind the attack.
Dr. Larry Giles pointed out at the press conference that the shark was seen in this area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injury in the upper part of the body.
The authorities for investigation and security closed for 48 hours access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca after Swami's in Ecinitas.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter a cosmetic market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's wants to build chains of Boots, SuperDrug and Debenham's cosmetic streets in the style of a business house, where specialized stores will be available.
As part of a strong market performance with cosmetics in the UK, which has a value of 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household needs decreases, streets with cosmetics will be tested in 11 sales throughout the country. In the case of success next year will then be extended to further sales.
Investment in cosmetics is linked to the efforts of supermarkets to find use for the rules used for television, microwaves and household needs.
Sainsbury's suggests that it doubles the offer of cosmetic products to 3,000 products and first, it also mentions brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
More space will also get the current range from the L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brand names similar to those in shops like Boots.
Supermarket also again introduces its make-up Boutique range, so most products will be vegan, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, in two Saintsbury’s sales, the concession will be tested by the retail perfume salesman Fragrance Shop. The first such trade was opened last week in Croydon in southern London and will take place next year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Buying online and moving towards daily buying a small quantity of food in local stores means that supermarkets need to make more effort to attract people.
Director-General Sainsbury's Mike Coupe says sales will continue to look more and more like business houses, because a chain of supermarkets is trying to improve the supply of services and non-food products to discount sellers like Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened in hundreds of sales of the Argos branch and also introduced a number of Habitat departments, which are chains that he bought two years ago. Thanks to this increased sales of food and supplies are even more profitable.
The previous attempt to transform the department with a cosmetic and pharmaceutical range ended unfavorably.
At the beginning of the millennium, Sainsbury’s tested a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after the dispute about the distribution of drug sales revenue in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s three years ago sold its 281 doctors for 125 million pounds of Celesio, which owns Lloyds’s drug chain.
Lloyds has a role to play in the plan by adding a range of luxury brands to four sales including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Business director Sainsbury’s Paul Mills-Hicks says: “We have changed the look and style of the street with cosmetics to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be able to deal with customers.
Our brand range should satisfy all needs and attractive environments and the beneficial location means that we now represent an attractive place for buying cosmetics that changes the old ways of buying."
Peter Jones is "distorted" after Holly Willoughby resigned from the contract for 11 million pounds.
The star of the Dragons Day Peter Jones series, after Holly Willoughby's TV moderator stepped away from the contract worth $11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of household clothing and Truly's accessories.
The company of this couple was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrov's actress.
The seven-year-old moderator announced the departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has blown the star of the Dragons Dan Peter Jones series by leaving their luxurious lifestyle business for the last time – to focus on their new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the reported sources, Jones "wurst" when a TV star at a busy Tuesday meeting in the centre of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that the new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, would no longer be able to devote enough time to their brand of household clothing and the membership of Truly.
The company was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrov and could double the fortune of Willoughby's moderator in the estimated value of 11 million pounds.
When a seven-year-old Willoughby on Instagram announced that Truly was leaving, Jones left Britain to one of his summer seats.
The unnamed source states: “Truly’s daughter was a top priority for Holly.
It should have been her long-term future, which will assure her for decades ahead.
Her decision to leave all the participants was totally shocked.
No one on Tuesday could believe what was going on, the release was so close.
In the centre of Marlow is the full warehouse of goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of a moderator of the series This Morning, which is one of the most efficient British stars, could make the company millions in view of the bold investment in products from pillows and candles after clothing and household clothing and the possible further delay in the indication of the brand.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby and Dan Baldwin's husband have been close friends with Jones for ten years and his wife, Tara Cappov.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand with Tara Capp in 2016 and 20 years old Jones joined the presidency in March.
Couples drive together on vacation and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby has to become an M&S ambassador and replaces Anta McPartlin in moderating the series I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones last night said: “We will not comment on his business. ”
Difficult conversation "and then we fell in love"
He pointed out the criticism he would receive from reporters for a note that some consider to be "unfortunate president" and how he spoke positively of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump responded with his ridiculous "voice" voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that after considering their June first meeting in Singapore Trump as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea, Kim is interested in another meeting.
But the deal on the elimination of nuclear weapons was tied to a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, a significant North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders on Saturday at the UN Valne Assembly that North Korea did not see a "responsive" response to its first steps towards disarmament.
Instead, the United States continues in sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump, in his speech, expressed a much more optimistic view.
"It's great with North Korea," he said.
“We were on the verge of a war with North Korea.
It would cost millions of lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
His efforts to improve his relationship with Kim led to positive results – ending the missile tests, helping to free the hostages and returning the remains of American soldiers to power.
And he defended his unusual access to information about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act as president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people outside into this crowded arena, we should have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said and showed up in front of the crowd.
The waves of tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
In the situation following the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs, for example, learned that there is no need for them.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok were expelled from their homes, there was no national disaster, which is a prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so it is a little demanding," says Mrs Sumbun.
The Save the Children is giving together a team that travels to Pal, but it is not clear yet whether foreign personnel can work here.
Speech agencies for national disasters, Mr. Sutupo said that Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Paul to see if international organisations could help.
Since earthquakes occur very often in Indonesia, the country in wrath of the Mother of Nature is still unresolved.
In Aceh there have been tsunami attacks, but on other parts of the coast it is not at all common.
He likely contributed to the loss of human life even to the apparent lack of Syrians in Paul’s warning against tsunamis, even though warning was given.
Even at the best time, traveling between many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
The ship that sailed to Lombok and helped the earthquake victim is now moving to Paul, but it will take at least three days before it gets to the scene of a new plague.
The improvement of the bad Indonesian infrastructure was the main point of the election campaign of President Joko Widodoa and the president lost a lot of money for roads and railways.
Next year, he'll try again for election, but his government is narrowing down the funding gap.
President Joko also faces pressure from persistent sectarian tension in Indonesia when members of the Muslim majority accept a more conservative form of faith.
Street fights between Christians and Muslims, where gangs use cats, bears, and arrows and other primitive weapons, have already claimed the lives of more than thousands of people and tens of thousands of people from their homes.
See: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool shot a balance sheet against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored at the London Stamford Bridge on Saturday in 89 minutes and thus saved Liverpool from losing Chelsea at the Premier League.
Sturridge got a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters before Chelsea gate when his team was losing 1-0.
He moved his ball to the left and shot it to a remote point.
The gun flew high and directed into the right upper corner of the gate.
The sword finally jumped over the jumping Kep Arrizabalag and ended up on the net.
"I was just trying to get to the right place to get a ball, and players like Shaq always play the most ahead, so I wanted to get as much time as possible," Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com server.
“I saw Kante coming closer to me, so I didn’t think much about it and shot at one touch.”
Chelsea in the middle of time led 1-0 after the peak of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker sent the band back to Mateo Kovacic, and then turned around in the middle of the field and sprinted halfway across Liverpool.
The fighter's ball has been playing fast.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard's beautiful street to the volcano.
He ran away from the defense and the left led to the remote tip of Alison Becker from Liverpool.
In the middle of the 15th hour, Liverpool in the League of Masters at the San Paolo Stadium in Italy, competes with the local team.
Chelsea will be playing on Thursday at 15 hours in London with Videoton in the European League of UEFA.
The number of victims of tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832
As the Indonesian disaster agency reported on Sunday morning, the number of earthquake victims and the wave of tsunamis dropped to 832.
The earthquake of 7,5 struck a degree on Friday, caused waves of up to 6 meters high and trapped many people in the troublesome buildings, said at the press conference of Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The city of Paul, which has more than 380 thousand inhabitants, was visited by the anxieties of built buildings.
Police arrested a 20-year-old suspect from stabbing a woman
The woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7.55 hours on Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called people in the area who saw or heard anything to sign up.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says this: “Research is only at the beginning, but I would like to appeal to everyone who moved near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I'm also asking everyone, especially taxi drivers, whose deck cameras could record something to contact us because they can have important information for our investigation,"
The police spokesman confirmed that a dead woman lived in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends came to the scene who think they know a woman to ask where she was found in the morning.
The police have reported that the investigation is under way and now inform their relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one should go to the building or get out of it.
When he found out what happened, he couldn't say a word.
The residents now learned that it would take a few hours before they could return home.
One man told the police that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A paid woman appeared on the scene.
He's still saying, "That's terrible."

Socha Cromwell in parliament recently became a hit on the "rewriting history" dispute
His expulsion would be deserved punishment for his fanatic Puritan followers in the style of the Taliban destroying many of the English cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society has called Mr. Crick's proposal "crazyness" and "the effort to rewrite history."
The president of the Cromwell Society John Goldsmith says: “In the ongoing debate on the removal of the soch was inevitable that the character of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Westminster Palace would become one of the objectives.
Cromwell didn't even make an iconoclass in English civil wars.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the deeds of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century."
The beautiful creation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the 19th century's opinion and part of the character's histories that many think they still deserve to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people consider Cromwell, although today less than at the end of the 19th century, to be the advocate of parliament in the face of external pressure, of course, by the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of an inexhaustible historical debate.
Of course, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century created the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identifiable position that represents one side of this transformation.
His achievements in the role of the Lord of the Protector are also a celebration and a reminder."
Killer pigs ripped off the Chinese farmer
According to local media, there was an attack and killing of a farmer by pigs in south-eastern China.
As the newspaper South China Morning Post wrote Sunday, a man named "Yuan" was found dead with a bloodthirsty bulge near the market in Liou-pchan-shuey in the province of Kui-chou.
The pig breeder is preparing to apply a vaccine to pigs in spring 30 May 2005 in Si-ning in the province of Čching-chai.
Apparently on Wednesday he came with a cousin from the nearby province of Jün-nan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found that the door to the side of the nail was open.
According to him, there was a big blood pressure in the skull.
According to the information, during the forensic examination, it was confirmed that the 250 kilograms per farmer had broken down.
"The brother had his legs all bloody and broken," quoted the journal Guiyang Evening News, named after "Wu".
The security camera record shows how Yuan came to market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousins.
The market manager told the Evening News newspaper that the pig was locked up so that no one could think of it when the police were collecting evidence on the scene.
The market representatives are allegedly dealing with the Yuan family on compensation for his death.
Pig attacks on people are rare, but they have already occurred in the past.
In 2016 the pig attacked the woman and her husband at the farm in Massachusetts and the man was critically injured.
About ten years ago, a 300kg pig brought a Belgian farmer to the tractor and dragged him to the farmer's wife.
After the Oregon Farmer ate his pig in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said the CBC News station that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can work as a "launcher".
"They're just playing.
They're witches... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to devote enough respect to them," he said.
The remains of the Rosa hurricane bring heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
According to predictions, Hurricane Rosa weakens and moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the next few days, however, rain will be brought to North Mexico and to the southwest of the United States.
At 5 o'clock in the morning, Rosa reached the wind speed of 137 km/h, representing Hurricane Category 1, and was 620 km southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific it forms a low-pressure rail and moves east to the western coast of the United States. When Rosa is approaching the peninsula of Baja California on Monday, she will have the shape of a tropical storm and start pushing tropical moisture north to the southwest of the United States.
In some parts of Mexico Rosa will bring up to 250 mm drops on Monday.
Tropical humidity, then, with the approaching low-pressure bridge in the following days, triggers potential rains in the southwest of the United States.
The droplets 25 to 100 mm locally cause dangerous bowel flooding, suti currents and possible dry ground in the desert.
Heavy tropical moisture causes the precipitations to be located between 50 and 75 mm per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwest of the United States, especially above most Arizona, is expected 50 to 100 mm of precipitation.
In rapid deterioration of the conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain, wave floods may occur.
In view of the dangers of tropical precipitation, it would be very unwise to walk into the wilderness.
The strong rain may cause the canyons to become river basins, and the storms will bring local storms and flying dust.
The approaching low pressure bridge will bring strong local hits on some parts of the southern California coast.
A total impact of more than 13 mm may occur, which could cause lower currents of the sun and of the bulging carriages.
It will be the first drop in the rainy season in this region.
On Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, isolated tropical hikes begin to reach Arizona, and on Monday evenings and on Tuesdays the rain will spread.
On Tuesday, the strong rain will spread to four corners and will last until Wednesday.
In October we can expect intense heat changes throughout the United States, because the Arctic is starting to cool, but in the tropical zone it will still be full heat.
This sometimes leads to rapid temperature changes in short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is Wednesday in the United States on Sunday.
The difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebrasce and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa is almost 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, they will try again to expand their summer heat.
In most areas in the middle and in the east of the United States, a warm beginning of October with temperatures of about 27 °C is expected from south-eastern payments to the north-east of the United States.
In New York City it could be 27 °C on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows in the first half of October a high probability of excess temperatures in the east of the United States.
The Brett Kavanaugh High School watched over 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched the six television channels for a fourth round of candidates' testimony to the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of having been sexually assaulted, allegedly in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political situation continued, and the voters interrupted the regular programmes with reports of a sudden Friday return: an agreement that the Senator for Arizona Jeff Flake provided, that the FBI would conduct a weekly investigation of the charges.
Christine Ford told the Senate's court board that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had sued her at a high school party in her drunken state and tried to dress her up.
Kavanaugh said in his excited statement that he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the event was attended by more than 20.4 million people, as stated by Nielsen.
The company calculated average monitoring at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
The numbers for the other stations that issued the statements, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen tends to have trouble starting people who look at their offices.
For comparison, it's a similar number of spectators who watch football matches in the play-off or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the greatest monitoring of all stations when, according to Nielsen's agency, it was attended by 5,69 million spectators during the entire day's hearing.
The second was the ABC station with 3.26 million spectators.
Nielsen points out that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest continued even after the end of the conversation.
Senator Flake was the main character of the Friday drama.
After the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugha, CNN and CBS cameras caught him on Friday morning, as protesters were shouting at him when he was about to go to the hearing of the judicial committee.
CNN carried on his life, how many minutes he stood with his eyes closed and let himself be put on.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you."
"Do you think the country is telling the truth?"
He also heard: “You have power over many women.”
Flake said his office issued a statement, and even before the door was closed, he added more to the committee's proceedings.
All cable and television networks were broadcast live later when the judicial commission was due to vote on the submission of Kavanaugh's nominations to the entire Senate.
But Flake said that he would only do so if the prosecution against the candidate was investigating the FBI next week, which required a minority of Democrats.
Flakea partially convinced talks with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After the conversation with Coons and several other senators, Flake decided.
Flake's voice was important, because it was clear that without an investigation the Republicans would not have to approve the Kavanagh vote.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into the charges brought against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused the criticism that Brexit "politicians"
Prime Minister Theresa May, in a Sunday Times discussion, accused the criticism of his plan to leave the European Union that "politicians" about Britain's future and undermine national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May comes to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another discussion, which was close to the Prime Minister on the title side, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan when he said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to choose their own duties was "unreasonably unreasonable".
Shooting Waydea Simse: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of the LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect in the case of the shooting of Waydea Simse, a 20-year-old LSU player.
The police department in Baton Rouge said that Ditéon Samson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on the basis of a second-degree murder charge.
The authorities published a video with a confrontation between Sims and Simpson and, according to the Sims police, lost the glasses in the fight.
According to the WABF channel, which belongs to CBS, the police have secured glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
According to the police, Simpson admitted that Waydea had been shot after the investigation.
According to the defendant, bail was set at $350 000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a head and neck injury.
The department thanks the police unit for the refugees of Louisiana, the criminal labs of state police, the Southern University police and local citizens for the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director LSU Joe Alleva thanked local police for the "pillars and striving for justice".
Sims's was 20 years old.
The two-metre attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU,
In the last season, the average score was 5.6 points and 2.6 points.
The basketball coach LSU Will Wade said on Friday morning that Wayde's death was a "striking" team and "shocked" him.
"This is what you're still afraid of," Wade said.
Sopka chrí ash on Mexico City
The ash that flows from the Popacatépetl soup hit the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans not to get close to the soup after the volcanic activity increased and 183 emissions of gas and dust were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was watching a number of scratches and cracks.
On social networks, images of the front glass of cars covered with a thin layer of ashes appeared in some quarters of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
The geophysics recorded an increase in the activity of the soup, which is 72 kilometres (45 miles) southeast of the main city. The last earthquake devastated central Mexico in September 2017 and had a power of 7.1 degrees.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Before the year of the independence vote, the police fired with Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesting independence from the police and thousands of people engaged in competition demonstrations on the occasion of the first year of the independence vote, which was distributed by Catalan.
Ordering policemen blocked a group of masked separatists who had cast eggs and powder after them. On the streets, which are usually flooded tourists, they created a dark cloud of dust.
Later, too, the lines to which the police had to use shoes were broken.
Groups supporting independence over several hours sang "We will not forget, we will not forgive" face-to-face the protesting steps of the Union, who called "Let Spain live".
According to the local press, 14 people were easily injured during the protests.
The year after the 1 October referendum, which Madrid considers illegal, but separatist Catalans celebrates, remains the tension in a region that is still high in independence.
The majority of the voters spoke for independence, but participation in the elections was low because the dissidents boycotted them.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police in the violent camps throughout the region tried to put an end to the vote in the polling stations.
Groups supporting independence remained on Friday night outside to prevent demonstrations to support the national police.
The demonstration went through, but she had to choose another route.
Eighteen-year-old electrician Narcissus Termes, who joined a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes in the prospect of gaining independence for Catalan.
“We had one of the best moments last year.
My parents were glad they could vote, but now we're in a blind alley," he said.
Despite the importance of the close victory in the regional elections last year in December, the Catalan party supporting independence had to fight to keep things going this year. Many of their most famous leaders either went to exile themselves or waited in court for their share in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
A twenty-four-year-old Mounter Joan Puig recorded a protest to support the police on his phone and said that the conflict had inspired politics on both sides.
"The situation is still more tense," he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders, who have been waiting for the end of last year in prison for trial, announced on Saturday that next year he will run for the European Parliament.
"The candidacy in European elections is the best way to condemn the drop in democratic values and the repression that we have witnessed by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car hit home
Three men at 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after the car repeatedly hit the house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was a damage to the gate and the house itself.
At one point, maybe someone shot the car out of the bush.
Meng's hit ensures Livingstone wins 1-0 over Rangers
First goal of Dolly Mengy for Livingston won
Livingston, who came from a lower division, shocked Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the only second defeat of 18 matches in the role of Ibrox club manager.
The Trefa Dolly Mengy proved decisive when Gary Holt's team arrived at Hibernate in second place.
Gerrard's team this season has not yet won the Premiership Prize in the host field, and next week it will build the first Hearts to lose eight points.
Earlier, Rangers will be visiting Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the European League.
Livingston expanded a number of unbeatable games in the division to six matches, so the main coach Holt, who was shooting Kenny Miller last month, hasn't tried to defeat yet.
Livingston didn't take a chance against the indiscriminate guests.
Holt's team was supposed to lead a long time ago because his directness caused Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but before the door failed, then Alan Lithgow, in his opinion, just passed the head of Craig Halkett in front of the white.
Home just to watch the Rangers play before them because they knew the guests could be in standard situations.
And so came the key target.
Against Rangers was built a free dome and Livingston created a sculpture, Declan Gallagher and Robinson sent Meng together, who played and scored the ball in the middle of the peace zone.
At this stage, Rangers dominated the holding of the ball, but the domestic defense for them was invincible and Liam Kelly's career was largely out of business.
The same picture of the game was in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos made Kelly try.
Scott Pittman stopped his legs by Rangers Allan McGregora and Lithgow did not meet with another standard situation in Livingstone.
The centres that the players were constantly cleaning into the rest of Livingstone’s territory, and two penal baths came along – after Halket’s attack on the replacement of Glenn Middleton and the others by hand.
“Fenome” from Livingstone – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Phenomenal performance and results for Livingstone.
They were excellent without exception, and on their way up they still surpassed expectations.
Their style of games and skill have hardly changed since the return to the peak, but great praise deserves Holt for how the team has been excavating since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was a great man, leading a great organized defense, while Menga kept up with Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall all the time.
Rangers are lacking inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but these standards don't apply anymore.
Their finals were chabs – only once penetrated the home side – and for Rangers it should be a wake-up because they are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan reached a mixed reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met on Saturday (September 29th) at breakfast in Berlin, the sky was blue and everyone laughed.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They did not agree on a number of issues, including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed for Kolín, where he opened a huge new mixture.
In this city there is the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police for security reasons prevented 25 thousand people from meeting in front of the mosque, but there were many supporters in the area who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people – many of them were Kurds – protesting Erdogan, who condemned his policy and the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
Controversy protests reflect the controversy of the visitor, whom some German Turks celebrated as a hero, and others proclaimed as an autocrat.
Accident in Deptford: The cyclist died after the crash with a car
In London, a cyclist died after a car crash.
The accident occurred about 10:15 local time near the Beswood Street crossroads with a ruinous street Evelyn Street in Deptford in the south-east of the city.
The car driver stopped and the ambulance arrived soon, but the man was dead.
There was only a few months after another cyclist died about a mile and a half from a Saturday’s tragedy site in an accident on Childers Street, when the driver got caught from the scene.
The Metropolitan Police stated that the police are now trying to identify and inform his relatives.
The road is closed, buses drive on replacement routes and drivers are recommended to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in trouble
According to the prison's office, six guards were injured at the men's jail with high alerts.
The riots broke out in Long Lartin's prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 local time and are still going on.
In order to deal with the emergency, which involved eight prisoners in a single wing, specialized supervisors from the Tornado team were called.
The guards suffered mild injuries and were treated locally.
Speaking in prison, he said: “In order to handle the ongoing incident in Long Lartin, special training was given to prison workers.
Six staff members were treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend a long time behind bars."
In Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous delinquents in the country.
In June it was announced that the director of the prison had ended the attack in the hospital.
And last October, the police were sent to prison for serious disturbances in which personnel were attacked by bullet bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens with floods in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (the area where it is dry can thrive)
It is not common for Arizona to hit a tropical low-pressure bridge, but it will probably happen at the beginning of next week when the remaining energy of the hurricane of Rosa overcomes the desert southwest and brings the risk of wave floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued a warning on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona for southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to be released on Tuesday straight through Phoenix and will bring rain on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix on Twitter stated that “only ten tropical cyclones have been kept up to 320 miles [320 km] away from Phoenix’s tropical storm or pressure lower since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Centre for Hurricanes predict the 50 to 100 mm dropouts, in the area of Mogollon Rim in Arizona up to 150 mm.
In other desert areas of the northwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Mountains, it is likely to fall 25 to 50 mm, with local fences up to 100 mm.
For those who are not at risk of berth storms, the rain of Rosa may be a blessing because the area is dry.
Floods are a very serious thing, but they may even help because the Southwest of the United States has just hit dry.
Server weather.com indicates that according to U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least "extreme drought", which is the second highest category.
The Hurricane Rosa will first take to the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still about the force of hurricane with maximum wind speed 137 km/h, then Sunday morning will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move 19 km/h north.
Then the storm will meet with the colder waters of the Pacific, and then it will lose its power.
It is expected that Mexico will arrive Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, precipitation will be strong, which is a major risk of flooding.
“In the area from Baja California to the northwest of Sonor, total cuts of 75 to 150 mm are expected, with up to 250 mm,” says the weather.com server.
Rosa then travels as a tropical storm across Mexico north and Tuesday in the early hours of Arizona and then goes to Arizona and Tuesday in the late evening to enter the South Utah.
"The main risk of Rosa or her remains is expected to be very severe in the Bay of California, the northwest of Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Centre for Hurricanees reports.
These rains are expected to cause fatally dangerous wave floods and streams of Sutiny in the deserts and droughts of the ground in the mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00 local time.
He was transferred to the hospital and his condition is now "stable".
As police told Avon and Somerset. Young men between 17 and 20 were detained at night in Radstock.
The police are looking for witnesses who could have on the phone a record of what happened.
Trump says that Kavanaugh has "defeated vanity and revenge" Democratic parties
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugha is by rejecting the indisputable and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump declared that during the process, Kavanaugh had "successed of vanity and contempt" by the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh spoke in front of the Congress on Thursday, where he resolutely and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's call that she was sexually assaulted several decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also spoke in the proceedings regarding her accusation.
The President said on Saturday that day "the American witnesses of Kavanaugh's excellence and qualities and courage were".
The representative of his supporters from West Virginia said that "the voice confirming Judge Kavanaugha is the confirmation of one of the greatest legal brains of our time, a lawyer who has an excellent public service on account".
The President directly challenged the Kavanaugh nomination when talking about how important it is for Republicans to participate in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks ago, one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't mind, but I'm still on the move," he said.
"That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump declared that the Democrats had decided on "responsibility and obstruction".
The Head of the Republican Party advised the CNN station that the first key procedural vote on the Cavanaugh nomination on the ground of the Senate was expected by Friday at the latest.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people and the number of victims is still growing
On Saturday, the authorities announced that after the Indonesian island of Sulawesi hit vast earthquakes and tsunamis, at least 384 people died of life, many of which were disturbed by the huge waves that flooded the beaches.
On the beach in Palu on Friday, hundreds of people met at the festival. During the summer, however, there were six-foot waves that killed many and destroyed everything that was on their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
"When the threat of tsunamis appeared yesterday, people continued in the activities on the beach and were not running away immediately, so they fell wild for the victim," said a spokesperson of the Indonesian agency for the defamation of BNPB Sutopo Purvo Nugroh's bribiffinque in Jakarta.
"The waves of tsunamis didn't go by themselves, they took cars, buildings, houses, they hit everything on the ground," Nugro said and added that before the attack on the coast, the waves of waves on the open sea spread 800 km/h.
He stated that some people before the wave fled to the trees and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to the 24th center of Pal.
The flying photographs published by the Agency for the Reduction of Landfalls show many destroyed buildings and shops, broken and broken bridges and mixed with water.
The results cut off the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
In its statement, the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy released by Friday's powerful shocks was approximately 200 times greater than the nuclear bomb's power dropped for World War II at Hiroshima.
The city lies at the end of long, narrow bays, which could have increased even more by waves.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said that there were thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels.
He mentioned that the bodies of some of the victims were found confined under the care of damaged buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho informed that the number of victims and damage could be greater on the coast 300 km north of Pal, in the area called Dongala, which is near the epicenter of earthquakes.
According to him, the communication was "exclusively protected without any information" from Dongala.
In his statement, the Red Cross stated that more than 300,000 people live in the area, and he added that his workers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse," the statement says.
On Saturday, the agency met with considerable criticism because it did not inform Paul that it hit the waves with tsunamis, even though the authorities indicated that the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
On amateur recordings shared on social media, it is heard that a man on the upper floor of the building is warning people on the street from approaching tsunamis.
Within a few minutes of the coast, the water wall will hit the building and the car.
The Reuters agency wasn't able to verify the record right away.
Earthquake and waves caused a major accident in the power plant that interrupted the communication around Paul, so the authorities could only co-ordinate rescue work.
According to the military authorities, freight aircraft began to be sent from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated people still need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened only to help transport and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit the evacuation centre in Pal on Saturday.
The number of Tsunami victims in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision workers from Donghal came to the city of Paul, where the employees were hiding in shelters from the temples built in the office building, they saw the images of the deaths on the way, said Mr. Doseb.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he adds.
It's too bad.
When relief groups began their sad disaster relief work, some complained that foreign workers with great experience should not come to Paul.
According to the Indonesian regulations, the funding, resources and staff from abroad may begin to flow instead of the Kalamati until the national disaster zone is declared.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the province level," says a speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross Aulia Arriani.
“As soon as the government says “OK, this is a national disaster”, we can start international aid, but it is not yet.”
When the second night of the Friday earthquake and tsunamis occurred in Paul, friends and relatives of those who were still unfaithful, they still hoped that their love would be the miracles that echo the grim stories of natural disasters.
They pulled out of the little boy's canal on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been imprisoned for two days under the care of her mother.
Gendon Subandano, a coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglidists in Asian games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Other people who were imprisoned at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a person who has been paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Mr. Gendon cured how in the hours that followed after the paragliding community learned about the establishment of the Roa Roa Hotel, he desperately sent news through WhatsApp competing with Paul, who participated in the beach festival.
His messages, however, ended with a shadow mark instead of two blue bolts.
"I think this means that the messages have not been delivered," he says.
Thieves took $26,750 while filling the ATMs in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from the police department in Newport, the thief killed 26 750 USD workers in Brink on the Levee on Friday morning, supplementing the ATM in Newport.
As detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the car driver emptied the ATM in the fun complex and prepared to put another money into it.
When he did so, another man "run away from the staff of Brink" and stole the money-supplier that should be put into the ATM.
According to the press report, several suspects were seen from the scene, but the police did not clarify the number of people involved in the incidents.
If you have any information about the identity of the suspect, please contact the police in Newport number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Raper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changes his name – on Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: "A person is formally known as Kanye West."
A forty-year-old West has named Ye for some time and used the pseudonym as the name of his eight album that came out in June.
The change comes before his show on Saturday Night Live, where he should introduce his new Yandhi album.
In the show, he replaces the singer Arian Grande, who cancelled his participation for "citizenal reasons", as the creator mentioned in the series.
The West has already said that the word for him has a short history of the current professional name and religious significance.
"In my opinion, "yes" is the most used word in the Bible, where "you" means "you," the West was allowed to hear the beginning of this year when he spoke about his album with a loud moderator Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us.
It has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye – as just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are,"
The name has changed a number of other famous rappers.
Sean Combs was known in different periods as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love (love) and Brother Love (brotherly love).
The former JAY-Z collaborator of the West was also writing with the associate and without him and the big and small letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use the army against civilians
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the blood attack against students, the newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador committed never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza promised that "he will never use the army to lure the Mexican people."
At a time when left-wing student movements spread throughout Latin America, soldiers on October 2, 1968 started shooting people at a peaceful demonstration in the square and killed up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those studying and opening up other free public universities.
He declared that unemployment and lack of opportunity for education would lead young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding for artificial intelligence
According to the investor and expert on the artificial intelligence of Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the USA should double the amount they are investing in research in this area.
The commentary comes after various parts of the U.S. government have published a notice on AI, although the U.S. as a whole has no formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China introduced a plan to be the only one in AI innovation by 2030.
"Dublining the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far away from the USA and we are looking for another breakthrough in AI," Lee says.
Lee said this week in a discussion for the CNBC that double funding could double the chance that the next major discovery in the area of AI will be made in the USA.
Lee, who published his book "Supervelmoci AI: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order" this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most important AI companies, Face+.
At the University of Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on the AI system that won the best American player in the game Othello, and later he was the head of Microsoft's research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee assessed the previous U.S. government technological competition, such as the Robotic Challenge of Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when else would help identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants, according to Lee.
"Academical peaks don't take China, but corporate," says Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been using the best university experts in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
To improve efforts in the area of AI, according to Lee, the United States could also help change immigration policy.
"I believe that green cards should be offered automatically to the doctorate holders in the field of AI," he says.
The State Council of China issued the Plan for the Development of the Art Intelligence of the New Generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way as the National Scientific Council and other government organizations are giving money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, says Lee.
This year, the US Ministry of Defence established the Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from the industry and from the academic environment, and announced to the White House the creation of a Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
DARPA announced this month that it is investing $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the NSF funding, it now invests more than USD 100 million per year in AI research.
However, the US legislation, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has not failed for a number of months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum if they want to change the name of the country
On Sunday, people from Macedonia voted in the referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to "the Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece, which blocks applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the northern neighbour represents a claim in its territory and therefore vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
Both governments have concluded the proposed new name agreement in June, but the nationalist opponents argue that the change weakens the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slovenian population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for the boycott raised doubts as to whether he would deliver the minimum of 50 per cent of the volunteers needed to make the referendum valid.
The question in the referendum was: "Are you a member of NATO and the EU with a future agreement with Greece?"
The guests of the change of name, including the President of the Zoran Zaeva government, claim that it is the price that is worth paying for Macedonia, one of the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia, to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come to vote today for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," says 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not mandatory, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will be guided by the result of the vote.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State electoral commission stated that no problems had been reported within 13 hours.
However, the vote was only 16 per cent versus 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters finally surrendered their vote.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old volunteer from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko, deliver their votes in the Macedonian referendum on the change of name, which would open the country's way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumlica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small podium and removes chairs from the positions of the people who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with a head-on, not a door for the service," Kavadarkov says.
“We are poor countries, but we have pride.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring Macedonia, which has a rate of unemployment of more than 20 %, so much investment as is necessary.
"I think a large majority will be for, because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
According to him, the result of 'yes' would be 'confirming our future'.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, the referendum could participate between 30 and 43 per cent of voters – which is less than the required participation.
Another survey organized by the Macedonian Telma TV station found that 57 per cent of respondents were going to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70% said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, it has to be delayed by 50 percent plus one volunteer.
The failure of the referendum would mean the first serious wound to the Western government's policy since its appearance last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City came for the goal through the entire Brighton defense
Sergio Aguero and Rahem Sterling arranged for Brighton's defense on Saturday, and thus secured Manchester City win 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
At Aguera's administration, his goal seemed ridiculously easy in 65 minutes.
It all started with the tape that the Argentine attacker got in the middle of the field.
He was running between three Brighton defenders and got into an open space.
Aguera then wrapped up four green clothes.
On the edge of Brighton's peace zone, one of the defenders visited and drove a few more.
The next recording on the left found Sterling.
The English attacker attached a ball to Agueru's rudimentary area back, which was handed over by the barbarian of Brighton Mathew Ryan to the right-hand side of the network.
"Aguero has problems with his legs," the city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We thought it would be 55 or 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We were lucky to have scored at the moment."
The initial advantage for Sky Blues in this game is Primer League, but Sterling has been set up.
This goal fell in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a ball deep in Brighton's territory.
On the left, he sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane worked his ball and then sent Sterling to a remote spot.
The Sky Blues attacker put a ball in the net just before he slammed out of the field.
The city will play on Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in the League of Masters at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to lose the joy of Rockies
When the Nationals were expelled from the game-off fight, there were not many reasons to perform again.
But forever competitive Scherzer hopes that on Sunday, he will stand up to the point of the broadcaster in the fight against Colorado Rockies – however only when they have Rockies, who lead the NL West in one match over Los Angeles Dodgers, hope for play-off.
Rockies secured their first title in the division on Friday night with at least a wild card winning 5-2 over the Nationals, but they still want their first title in the division.
“Even if we don’t play anything, we can at least start because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the second team will be playing with the greatest effort I’m going to experience this year.
Why don't I play in it?"
Nationals haven't announced who's going to start on Sunday, but they're supposed to stay out of Scherzer's situation.
For Scherzer, it would be the 34th start, and on Thursday, he would train and go on Sunday, when he's usually free.
In this season, Washington's regular broadcaster has statistics 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 changes.
Trump went out for a meeting in West Virginia
The President spoke directly about the situation around his candidate to the judge of the highest court of Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republic's participation in the mid-term election.
“Everything we have proved will be in place in November.
In one of the most important choices in our lives, there are five weeks left.
It's one of the big, big – I don't mind, but we're still moving and fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see the terrible group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take over the power by any means necessary, you see here vanity, resistance.
They don't care who gets hurt, who needs to change to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we don't give them that."
According to him, the Democrats decided to "responsibility and obstruction".
"And you see it in the last four days," he added, saying that the Democrats are "disgrace and evil and resistance and slander."
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Judicial Commission, democratic Senator Diana Feinstein, which led to a loud cracking of obscurity.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Uh, what?
No, uh, wait – it was really the wrong word of the body – the worst word of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a wide range of views.
It is intolerant to those who express their opinions
When the Moment activists in my local side voted for my remarks, there was no surprise.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour Members who said they were not welcome – because they sincerely said their opinion.
My colleagues from the parliament, Joan Ryan, did the same because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, paradoxical similar issues which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement of a Friday Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East stated that "we want the meetings to be accessible and productive."
Most of the eight years I was a member of the local parliament on the labour market, the GC meeting on Friday night was exactly the same.
Unfortunately, most of the meetings today do not last, and the promise of a "more loving, more respectful" policy has long been forgotten if it ever started with it.
It is becoming increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated in the Labourist side and that any opinion is assessed as acceptable for the conduct of the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, colleagues, whom I had previously thought had similar political views, suddenly expected me to turn 180° and stop the position I would otherwise not agree with – whether it is national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it doesn’t even matter what I say – then there’s a crowd of social media outlets, where they call for my withdrawal, denouncing Wednesday policy, and telling me that I shouldn’t be on the labor market.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues because the comments are usually political.
I have respect for the professionality and determination of those colleagues who face each day the threat of sessistical or racist abuses, but never will.
One of the aspects of this era of politics, of which I am most disappointed, is how the violations become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should grow a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer this varied opinion stream, and with each proposal for a declaration of mistrust or a change in the rules of choice, the party becomes more limited.
In the last two years, they have been working many times for me to stay back, not to be so upset, and then "I will be fine."
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I entered the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the poor government of Margaret Thatcher, who has let my class of general school literally collapse, I have tried to fight for better public service for those who need it most – whether as a local worker or a government minister.
I never hid my policy in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been surprised by my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this proposal on Friday, I would just say that if the country is moving to Brexit, which is damaging to households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
However, my main message is not for Momento in Nottingham, but for my wishers, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political pragmatism will deter me from acting according to what I think is best for you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Ayr climbs to the top
Two late fives had a bit of a final result, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this amazing fun game Tennent's Premiership.
Now they're in the front of the tables, as the only failure.
Finally, it was an excellent defense and a better use of the odds that helped home to win, and Peter Murchie's visitor had the full right to be satisfied.
"In our fights we have been through great trials and we are still not defeated, so I have to be happy," he says.
Robyn Christie from Melrose says, "All honor to Ayr, they got a better chance than us."
Five Grant Andersons in 14 minutes, changed by Frazier Clim, sent Air ahead, but the yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, which was released by the Warriors, enabled Melrose to take advantage of numerous acquisitions and Jason Baggot got an unchanged five.
Climo increased the lead of Ayr with the penalty and then scored exactly in half time and changed his solo attempt, so he adjusted to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson, changed by Baggot, reduced lead to five points.
Then there was a further delay due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who left the playground on the sidewalks, and when he started playing again, Ayr again jumped up thanks to the five Stafford McDowalls who changed Climo.
Substituting Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and Melrose again used the players in addition thanks to Bruce Colvin's unchanged five after a short strong pressure.
However, the home returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow for the attack of the Clim without a ball, MacPherson of the penal order put the ball behind the progressive little Ayr.
Climo changed, almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's head and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth five of his household.
Star Still Game starts a new career in hospitality
It appears that the star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series is moving into the area of hospitality. It was found that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A sixteen-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvise in a popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he plays together with a long-standing comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
Two have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the final series of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, Arigingmorn Limited is the Director.
Herec refused to comment, but the source of the Scottish Sun newspaper indicated that Kiernan wants to join the "prospering business in restaurants" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": the interior Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are watching the La Paz Marine Command, which is decorated with wire.
Over the public buildings is a blue flag in the color of the ocean.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca for the Amazon are described by the password: “The sea is our right.
Getting it is our duty."
Throughout Bolivia, there is still a living memory of the coast, which the country lost in the favour of Chile in the bloody war on resources in the 19th century – as well as the desire to repatriate the Pacific.
These desires may be greater than a few decades, because Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice, which should fall on October 1 after five years of trial.
"Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course expects a positive outcome," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the MSD on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide for the benefit of Bolivia's claim that, after many decades of interrupted talks, Chile must act on Bolivia's sovereign approach to the sea.
Charismatic native president Bolívia Evo Morales – who has a controversial battle to re-election next year – is also very interested in the Monday decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide for the benefit of Bolivia – and even if it did, it would not change much.
This United Nations agency, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign any Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the MSD decision comes only six months after the last arguments were presented shows that the case was "not complicated", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the past four years, not only have they supported Bolivia, but they may have hated her more.
"The issues of access to the sea have been strengthened by the existing Bolivian government," Zárate says.
It adds that Morales' attack rhetoric has weakened all the remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will once again act, but after this it will be extremely difficult to conduct a discussion.
Both countries have not changed their ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltz, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday he will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreement with each other’s advantages”, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would use the question of the sea as a political barrier.
"The disease never surrenders its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons won't come unless the United States can believe it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation never arm their nuclear weapons as the first if he can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations Valne Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises given at the summit of the leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after it appears that the foreign minister of the United States Mike Pompeo is about to restart nuclear diplomacy, which was tied to the dead point, more than three months for a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Unem.
Ri says that they are "hopefully planned", that the continued sanctions and the opposition of the United States against a declaration ending the Korean war could sometimes hit the North on their knees.
Washington is careful about consenting to the declaration if Pchjongang does not take significant steps to disarmament first.
Kim and President of the United States Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, it is common skepticism that Pchjongang thinks he is serious about rejecting this arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure his safety.
Pompeo wants to visit Pchjongang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris reviews show that the latest trend of huge head coverings in your fashion shops will soon arrive.
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block the sun, your search is at the end.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne discovered a series of hugely cracked head coverings for their spring/year 2019 collection for a review that took all of them on the Paris fashion week.
Very non-practical hats this summer flooded Instagram and these designers sent to the mill their exciting creations.
The exhibition piece from Valentina was overcrowded with a wide edge of memory of the feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Other too large supplements were decorated melons, magic hats and even pineapples – but they are not meant to warm their heads.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks – and just in time at Halloween.
Many of the pestrocoloured masks have their lips covered and remind of Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One production recalled the submersible equipment with both snorkel and glasses, while the other looked like a grain of scattered ice.
And if you go on with a huge mode, you're lucky.
Modern experts predict that huge caps could even enter fashion stores.
The oversized hats come after "La Bomba", a straw with half a meter of wide cream, all of which were carried from Rihanny to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cultural brand behind this very non-practical hat, which flooded the social media, sent another huge creation to the preview mill – a straw beach bag, which is almost as big as a model in the swimsuits that carry it.
The dark orange rafi bag, which has been removed by the rafia trimmings and designed for handling white leather, was on the Paris Fashion Week with an exhibition piece of La Riviera year/year 2019 from Jacquemuse.
The Stylist famous Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in fashion shops for the next summer – given that the designer has so much success with them, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too large supplements.”
John Edward: Language skills are necessary for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have a number of academic achievements, and they continue to have other excellent results in 2018. Individual and group achievements in sports, art, music and other community activities only encourage this.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) is represented by more than 30,000 pupils throughout Scotland, and seeks to ensure the best level of service for their students and parents.
Independent schools prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as a global citizen.
As a sector of education that can design and implement individually adapted school education plans, we note that modern languages are still popular and requested in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak with a person’s language that he understands, it goes straight to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes straight to his heart."
It is an important observation that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
The latest results of this year's trials show that the languages are the first of the tables, with no higher level of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students learning a foreign language achieved the best marks of A.
Data gathered from 74 SCIS schools show that the highest score A reached 72 per cent of Mandarin students, 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills as children and adolescents will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages like subjects that students choose are as important in the study plans of independent schools as those of STEM (sciences, technology, technical fields and mathematics).
The study carried out by the British Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that, for reasons which employers indicate as problems with the inclusion of vacancies, 17% of language skills are insufficient.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in the preparation of young people for their future career.
As more and more jobs require languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
If a person chooses any career, if he learns another language, he will have a real benefit in the future that he has such lifelong skills.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person speaks more languages automatically for the benefit of competition.
According to a survey organised by YouTube in 2013 by 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75 percent of them failed to speak in a foreign language well enough to be able to conduct a conversation, and the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, namely 15 %, was French.
Therefore, it is important for children today to invest in language learning.
If children learn more languages, especially languages that develop economies, they will have a greater chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, every school varies by language.
A number of schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be the most important for Great Britain in terms of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child is interested in, he will always have independent schools to choose from a number of languages with teachers who are in the field.
Scottish independent schools devote themselves to providing the educational environment that children will prepare and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future awaits them.
At this point, it cannot be denied that languages are essential in the global business environment for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
It needs to be done.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is the first to be presented in the fashion of Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans who look forward to the first time LeBron James comes to Los Angeles Lakers are waiting for them soon.
Lakers Luke Walton's coach announced that James will be playing in the Sunday's opening game predicted in San Diego against Denver Nuggets.
But it's not clear how many minutes he plays.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton told Lakers on the official website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell on Twitter wrote that James probably plays only a limited number of minutes.
Last week after the training, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers matches in the pre-season.
"At this stage, I don't need pre-sex games," he said.
trumpet performance in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump tonight at Wheeling in West Virginia starts a wave of campaigning.
It's the first of the five minutes planned for next week, including a stop in friendly places, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the suspension of the vote on the confirmation of his candidate to a vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to receive support for the upcoming elections in half of the mandate, as the Republic stands in November elections before the risk of losing Congress.
What time does Trump's show start tonight and how can you watch it online?
The trumpet meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled at 19:00 east time, today Saturday 29 September 2018.
The trumpet holder in West Virginia you can watch online below through live transmission on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about hearing a candidate to the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, which went through this week and was very tense about charges of inappropriate sexual behaviour. It is expected that the Senate's confirmation vote will be postponed for a week before the FBI's investigation takes place.
But the main objective of this wave of strikes is to help the Republicans to speed up the November elections.
According to the Reuters agency, campaign organisers of President Trump say that these five meetings will be aimed at "adding energy to volunteers and supporters, so that Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority of representatives in the Senate and in Snow White".
"The control over the Senate is so important for his agenda that the president will go to the most States in this Russian season," said Reuters spokesman for Trump's campaign, who did not want to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, supporters from "Ohia and Pennsylvania and could follow the media from Pittsburgh" could be accepted at today's headquarters in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling.
On Saturday it will be twice in the last month, which Trump will visit West Virginia, in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the Senate for West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the investigation.
“For Morriseye, it is not a good point that the president must come to help him in his research,” says Reuters Politologist at the University of Zapadovirgin Simon Haeder, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown that the stomach is to fight to keep hopes from Sunday alone
After three one-sided matches there can be two Saturdays just what Ryder Cup needed.
The hopeful quad is a completely thought-out sport concept, but players really believe it, and most precisely in such competitions.
So where's the quad going to collapse now?
"They know about six points and now they're four, so we're taking it so that the square is moving a little bit towards us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, leads four points and still remains twelve.
As Speeth says, Americans feel they have a little wind in the clouds, and there are many things that can stimulate them, such as the shape of Speethe and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each one can boast three points of four.
Speeth was dying when he moved from the shelter to the green and went as an example.
The famous screams still intensified in the continuation of his bike when he managed the key pad to win the whole match when they were with Thomas in two holes in the back of two.
His trip, which won them a 15-hour match, met a similar giant who tells you that the American team is not out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own fight," Spieth said.
That's all each of these players left.
18 bucks to leave the trail.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of Ryder Cup.
Strange, but beautiful two from Europe are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood was the only two who didn't hit the hole on Saturday afternoon, but last Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and again on Friday morning."
This course and the way the energy flows towards the stormy audience confirms from it that these are the players for the Sunday victory, and that in the West of the Sun over Le Golf National there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Best both at the same time on a different hole.
However, the words about European glory remain premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson worked briefly with Serge Garcia, a hero of early games with four balls when he was married to Alex Noren.
The cave and the two saws on the front nine buried Spain and Sweden into a ruin from which they had not escaped.
But no one will help you on Sunday.
Two-player games on two balls are so fascinating when you're closely following people's interactions in a couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has been playing better than a team, and by the last day, it has been a great leap, but this game has also shown that the U.S. team has a stomach for the fight that some, especially from the states, have doubted.
To the final day Ryder Cup leads Europe with 10-6 points
Europe has gained a healthy advantage until the last day of Ryder Cup after the two-ball games on Saturday came out with a 10-6 jump over the United States.
The inspired Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who reportedly won almost twice over the competing Tiger Woods, decided to make four shots in Le Golf National.
The European party with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to hold the trophy they lost in Hazeltine, dominated in the early games on two balls with the American side, which failed in the 3-1 series.
The U.S. showed more resistance in the four, won two matches, but couldn't get to the deficit.
Page Jim Furyk needs eight points from Sunday's 12 matches to leave the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novelty to win four points behind it, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Mollwood" after the weekend, are just the second pair to win four points from their four initial matches in the history of Ryder Cup.
After the defeat of the Woods players and Patrick Reed in the game on two balls and then quickly defeated the tired Woods and the American novel Bryson Dechambeau even more important 5&4.
Woods, who went through two matches on Saturday, showed occasional brilliance flashing, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in the game two to two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who started after the early game on two balls, returned to Henrik Stenson's partner in the game two to 2&1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koopy - singles and threes in the world score.
Europe, however, did not have it in this pleasant fresh day south-west of Paris saved on the whole line.
Three-way top winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas raced for the Americans on Saturday at two points.
They won a tough 2&1 victory over Spain Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the game on two balls and returned to defeat two Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the game of two, although the first two jackets lost.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup is the team returning from a four-point deficit to a double, although as a defending party of Furyk only needs a discount to get a trophy.
After the second day was the best in two days, it seems that there's a Sunday attack behind them.
North Korea says that "in no case" are not armed unilaterally and without trust
Foreign Minister North Korea said on Saturday that the continued United Nations sanctions had deepened their confidence in the United States, and under such circumstances the country will never surrender its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual Valuable Assembly that North Korea had adopted in recent years "a major measure of good will", such as stopping nuclear and rocket tests, dismantling nuclear testing sites and promises that nuclear weapons and nuclear technology would not be expanded.
"But we do not see the corresponding reactions from the USA," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is not possible to arm itself unilaterally."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to the "step-by" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for each step, his declaration appeared to be significant in that it did not refuse unilateral denuclearization just because Pchjongang had already passed in the past.
Ri mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Chong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim undertook to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump pledged the guarantees of the security of North Korea.
North Korea seeks to formalize the war conflict from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said that Pchjongang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the challenge of releasing severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The US continues to “denouclearize the first” and increases the pressure on sanctions in order to achieve its objectives, and even oppose the “declaration of the end of the war”, Ri said.
“I think that sanctions can bring us on our knees, we dream of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions are exacerbating our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings of Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If this issue of denuclearization were by the side of South Korea and not by the USA, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come into such a pitiful situation."
However, the tone of Rio's speech was dramaticly different from that of last year, when he told the United Nations-wide meeting that the North Korean missile targeting in the US is inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "a rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations Trump, which threatened the "total destruction" of North Korea, Kim praised for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that much work and sanctions must still be carried out until North Korea is fully denuclearized.
On Wednesday Trump said he had no time frame for this, he stated: "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pchjongang for the measures taken.
However, on Thursday, US Minister for Foreign Affairs Mike Pompeo informed the UN Security Council that: "The continuation of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue thoroughly and without standing until we realize the complete, final, verified denuclearization"
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to suppress the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles Pchjongang.
Pompeo and Ri met at the United Nations-wide meeting and Pompeo announced that next month he would visit Pchjongang to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not end well.
He left Pyongyang in July and declared that progress had been made, only to inform North Korea about him for several hours that he had made "gangster demands".
North Korea committed itself to meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile area and also the nuclear complex if the United States adopts "appropriate measures".
He stated that Kim informed him that the "relevant measures", in which he hoped, were the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and aimed at normalising relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard with a participating course to learn enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has made all its students sleep more, and it is in an effort to fight the growing culture of macho studies all night long when students sleep and are excited about caffeine.
The academics have found that students at the world's most popular university are often unemployed when it comes to the basics of self-care.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and a female hospital who is believed to be the first species in the United States.
He was inspired to start a course after teaching about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“A girl came to me at the end and said, ‘Why are you telling me just now, in my last year?’
She said that nobody ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first presented this year, explains to students basic information about how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performances and improve their overall atmosphere.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said that the university decided to introduce a course after finding that the students were really not asleep during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of student colleges where students click on bars with coffee, curtains, tennis and books on the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleep habits.
In the other part, participants are informed of how long-term sleep depression can increase the risk of heart attack, death, depression and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
However, we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on health," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in “study all night” still exists, adding that modern technologies and the growing pressure on students mean that the problem of lack of sleep also increases.
The provision of sleep of good quality should be the "secret weapon" of a student for combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even so as not to fail to recover, because sleep deprives the brain into the mode of hunger, so man is still hungry.
Raymond So, 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to propose a course that he graduated from one of his classes during the first year of Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to press the whole course.
He hopes that in the next step, he will ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before entering the competitive institution.
The professor recommended that the students consider setting an alarm for the time when to go to bed, as well as wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic displays and LED lighting, which can determine your circus rhythm, leading to problems of descent.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga submerge Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss when the Dolly Mengy trial confirmed Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with the 1-0 defeat in Livingstone.
The Ibrox site tried to record its first victory from February 4th to February 1st at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only caused the second defeat of Gerrard in 18 games as a manager to leave its post eight points from the leading Leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes ago half-time and the Rangers composition seemed to be out of inspiration and determination to balance.
While Rangers are now dropping to sixth, Livingstone is climbing to third and immediately behind the Hibernian team to one branch.
And it could come to other Rangers' problems after the magic judge Calum Spence had been treated with head injury after he was probably hit by an object from the point of view.
Gerrard made eight changes on his side, which she moved around Ayr to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who picked up a point of Hearts last week and would be delighted to see his well-trained manpower pushing his opponent at every step.
Rangers may have been holding, but Livingstone did more with the ball on their side.
They were only supposed to score two minutes after Menga first left Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor, but the hostage buried his big chance.
A far-off drop of Keaghan Jacobse then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only try at the last post.
Rangers took control, but it seemed that in the last third, there would be more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have a quarter-hour penalty when he and Steven Lawles met, but Judge Steven Thomson threw the Colombian challenge out of the table.
Rangers managed only two targets in the first half, but the ex-brainer Ibrox Liam Kelly was surprised by the head of Lassany Coulibaly and the short shot of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in 34 minutes could be against the running of the game, no one can deny that they already deserved it for the wood.
Rangers failed to deal with the deep Jacobs set again.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher sent a ball to Scott Robinson, who was in peace and took Menga to an easy finish.
Gerrard took action at the stop and exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had almost immediate results when the wing was stuck to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly was fighting off the line and the attack was blocked.
But Livingston kept attracting visitors to the game exactly the kind they like when Lithgov and Halkett metal one long ball after the other.
Holt's party could have deepened its momentum in the final stages, but McGregor had a good position to block Jacobs before Lithuania broke out of the corner.
Deputy Rangers Glenn Middleton had another delayed claim for punishment when he was wrong with Jacobs, but Thomson turned back.
Almanach: Find Geiger's Readers
And now the page from our almanac "Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years old, and still arrives... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as Geiger's reader.
Geiger Counter's chair also became a pop-up of culture, as in a 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in the main role of the apparently unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, “What is the matter with God?”
Rogers: “It is Geiger’s reader that is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put this earpiece on, you can really hear the effects of the atoms emitted by radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Well, now she's really in it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach an immune system to "see" dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise dangerous cells as part of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation into the laboratory
Then they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then re-injected
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
One woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise dangerous cells has had the cancer of the ovaries for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their metabolism in the laboratory, so they can "see" the protein common in many cancers called HER2 and then be re-used in the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda in Maryland said, "Our results indicate that we have developed a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “directs the growth of several types of cancer”, including breast cancer, ovaries, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach, when immune cells were taken from patients and “learned” was to focus on cancer cells, has already been promoted in leukemia treatment.
Kanye West participated in the pro-trump preaching, in his magic hat, after his performance on SNL.
It didn't go very well
Kanye West was published in a study on Saturday Night Live after a confused show, during which President Donald Trump praised the US and said he would run in 2020.
After singing the third song that night, called Ghost Town, in which he was wearing the head of Make America Great Again, he began swimming on the Democrats and repeated his support of President Trump.
“I often talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you like Trump, because he’s a racist?’
If I were to control racism, I wouldn't be in America long ago," he said.
SNL started a show parody with Matte Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood star was making fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee on the cry for rape of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's plays of theatrical talk were recorded on social media by comics Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to make West laugh.
West also complained to the spectators that he had a good time to eat in the back of his head.
"I was shocked in the back.
They said, "Don't go with that hat."
It's a joke!
They also said that I was in the wrong place," Washington Examiner said.
West continued: "Do you want to see the wrong place?" and added that he would "put on his superman suit, because that means you can't say what I'm supposed to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments were only used by the audience twice and the SNL members seemed humiliated, in despair, says Variety, and one person even said: "The whole studio is completely quiet."
Westa was invited as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West fooled many present by singing song I Love dressed as a bottle of water Perrier.
West received support from the TPUSA, Candace Turner, a conservative group, who tweeted: “To one of the most important characters: Thank you, JE SES POSTIVIL DAVU.”
But the guest talk show Karen Hunter on Twitter wrote that the West was "just who it is, and it's absolutely amazing."
“But I do NOT want to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his “artificial”) who I believe represents and transmits to the world of ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Just like us," she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name and said he's now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and go in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Comrade rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly named Snoop Lion and, of course, the lost musical legend of Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then an artist previously known as Prince.

Game Thrones Star Kit Harington has left into the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in his hand in violent medieval fantasy series HBO.
Herec, 31 years old, however, came out of the stereotype macho hero and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to earn respect.
News The Sunday Times Culture Kit said he believed that "something is wrong" and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his star of the Rose Leslie throne, also 31, admitted that he said that this problem was “very strong”.
"At this point, I personally feel, quite strongly, what has become so bad with the masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach grown-up men about the problem we now see here?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic men thanks to its very male figures.
He continued: “What is born again, and what is taught?
What are boys learning on TV, on the streets, growing up feeling that every man needs to have his own page?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time - how to change it?
Because young men must have changed something to worse.
In the discussion he also admitted that he would not play in any prequel or sequel games on thrones after the series is finished, because he already has enough "fights and horses".
Since November Kit will be playing in the renewed Straight West Sam Shepard, which is the story of the film producer and his brother, the wolf.

Rose played Ygritte, an object of love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in this fantasy series rated by Emmy.
In June 2018, a couple were taken to the home of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China shows 14% increase in new cases
China has reported 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official figures, more than 820,000 people have been affected by this virus.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, which meant a change against the past.
Traditionally, HIV is spread over some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have been infected with HIV in this way has been reduced almost to zero, Chinese doctors have introduced at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 per year.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT is allegedly still widespread.
In view of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men are finally treated as women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these situations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has pledged universal access to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters argues that staff would have avoided the data of the GOP senators, the terms "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory"
On Saturday, US MP Maxine Waters condemned the claim that a member of her staff had sent personal data from three Republican American senators to the legislature's website.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claimed that the charge was supported by "ultraprachtic" scientists and websites.
"Liars, lies and other serious lies," Watersová said in his Twitter statement.
The information reportedly included the addresses of home and phone numbers for American senators. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared Thursday on the Internet and published an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate's discussion on sexual abuse charges by the candidate of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh.
The missing information came sometime after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address, which is the source of the contributions, is connected to the Waters office and published information about members of the Waters staff, says Hill.
"This unsubstantiated claim is a completely false and absolute lie," Waters continued.
‘The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were threatened as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was in no way responsible for the failure of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a completely false and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly served online criticism, including from the former press secretary of the White House of Ari Flescher.
"This insult is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This means that he has no temper to be a member of the Congress."
If someone is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
It can't be upright.
He must not question the motives of the plaintiff.
He must be calm and not interrupt."
It seemed that Fleischer compared the Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats to the judge Kavanaugh, who was criticised because he seemed to be too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who participated in the election against Waters, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"If it were true, it would be something," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had warned “the competent authorities and the authorities involved in criminal proceedings against these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the creditors are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every member of my staff."
Johnny English again includes a review – weaker espionage parody Rowan Atkinson
It is already customary to look for Brexit in every new film with a British trend, which also seems to be the case of Johnny Englishe's recovery in a series of action parodys - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this tough satire be on the subject of how clearly we are a bad nation, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this clever, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to repack things in a completely new way - that name more than any other signal that a wide comical design is intended for the non-English speaking cinematographic audience.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre demands on smoothie glamour, has a little from Inspector Clouseau, a joke from Mr Bean and a big bite of the guy who sang the only tone in the chariots of Fire at the Festival of Olympic Games in London 2012.
The character is also originally based on the traveller and the international secret man Atkinson once played in the already forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, and who left chaos behind.
In this last edition of the JE there are one or two beautiful moments.
I loved Johnny Englishe as he approached the helicopter in the middle of the fire, and his rotor hats were whizzing about his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is displayed, but humor feels quite subdimensional and strangely superfluous, especially when "series" film brands like 007 and Mission Nes are now offering comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is more like a child than an adult, and for me, the crazy trampotes of Johnny Englishe are as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film gags in Mr. Bean's person.
The current assumption is that the United Kingdom has serious problems.
Cyber hacker infiltrated the British super-secret web network of spies and discovered the identity of all British agents in the field, to scare the agent in service - to a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for the Prime Minister, who is a spring and busy character, who is already suffering from the complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson's love for Theresa May character is playing the best, but there is nothing in the script.
Her rapporteurs inform her that as soon as every active spy is threatened, she will have to return someone from retirement to work.
This means that Johnny English himself, who is now employed as director in some luxury facility, but at the same time, he gives a record lesson about how to be a secret agent: here are a couple of nice gagas, because English offers a Spanish Academy similar to the School of Rock.
English returned to Whitehall for the emergency bribiff and met with his former long-suffering partner, Bough, who was played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man who lives with the commander of the basement, an affected character on which Vicki Pepperdine may even be a bit of a swimmer.
So Batman and Robin are back in action in packing tasks for the Secret Services of Her Majesty, and they meet with the beautiful woman of the fatal Opheli Bulletin, which Olga Kurylenko played.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously subjected to the charismatic technological billionaire's spell, who claims he can solve British computer crimes: the vicious Jason Volt, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their ossuary full of frescoed patals: masking as a waiter burns a French restaurant; creates chaos when they crash on board Volt's luxury yachts; and English launches a clean anarchy when they try to meet the interior of Volt's home with virtual reality.
All the essays are certainly prepared for this last sequence, but whether it's even nice and noisy, it has something in it from the children's TV.
It's a rather moderate matter.
And just like the other Johnny English films, I couldn't imagine: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson the role that really fits his talent?
Labourers deny that they would develop an English plan to work four days a week to get paid in five days
Jeremy Corby's Labour Party is going to consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and will be paid in five.
The party allegedly wants the heads of companies to transfer savings from the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to employees.
Employees would enjoy the weekend - but they would still receive the same reward.
The source claims that this idea would be "turned" into the economic agenda of the party and is planning to favor the country in favour of the workers.
The four-week shift was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of changing economies.
A long - term worker for the Sunday Times stated: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight, but a week's work week is a wish that falls into the party's position to export the economy for the benefit of the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party has pledged a quarterly work week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour Party spoke: "The weekly work week is not our party's policy and the party does not take it into account."
The shadow office John McDonnell used last week's work conference to fulfill his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to return energy from "anonymous directors" and "experts" in utility companies.
The plans of the shadow office also mean that the current shareholders in the water companies do not have to return to their total share, as the Labour Government could carry out "flashes" on the basis of the alleged commission.
It also confirmed plans to place employees in the company's management board and create own property funds that transfer 10% of own funds of private enterprises to employees who are entitled to pay annual dividends up to 500 libre.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said in a series of "60 minutes", whether the investigation of the FBI Kavanaugh could change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has left the last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether the finding of the office could move some Republican senators to seek their support.
In Sunday's "60 minutes" interview, the correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would have made them change their mind.
Kennedy looked more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said that I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanagh.
I called him when the charge came out, and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, clear."
However , the Graham decision is inconceivable .
"I have already made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and it would mean a truly explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly rejected it," Graham added with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of those whom she called could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York, the annual Global Citizen Festival will take place, which offers a very impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission at the end of world poverty.
The Festival Global Citizen in the seventh anniversary welcomes tens of thousands of people who will meet in Central Park to enjoy not only artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of action, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty project, an international group to support the end of poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to get free admission to the event (if you were not willing to pay for the VIP entry), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, e-mail to the world leader, telephone or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen 12 years ago before he reached his goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert really by the way they are to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case called "clickivism" - people who feel that by signing online petitiones or sending tweets, something changes?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its beneficiaries, trying to achieve different goals.
It says that these actions have contributed to the world’s leaders’ announcement of commitments and measures of more than $37 billion to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, a group of 390 commitments and notifications arising from its activities, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid or financed.
The Group estimates that the funds secured so far have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key commitments are the Power of Nutrition project, a British partnership of investors and realists who committed themselves to "helping children grow to their full potential", promising to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end subcontracting in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, like you, we can only make a note of social injustice in the form of abuse in history,” the ambassador of the Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman said a gift during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that, following more than 5,000 actions called for by the U.K. to improve food for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which is responsible for 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequent questions on your web site with the question, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty? ”
The Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and hard journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and the movement against apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among those who will host Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman this year in New York.
The United States could use the Navy for "blocking", which would protect Russian energy exports - Minister of Interior
Washington could "if necessary" turn to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the markets, including the Middle East, the US Minister of Interior Ryan Zinke, quoted Washington Examiner as saying.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria - especially where it is acting on the invitation of the legitimate government - is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to provide energy just as much as in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," he said.
And according to the official declaration, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the opportunity to use our shipping industry to ensure that maritime routes are open and, where necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy is not on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the events organised by the Energy Alliance, which is a non-profit group that is considered to be "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach and conversation with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are practically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is to invest more in or replace fuel," he introduced and at the same time called for Russia as a "unique" player with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declaration is due to the fact that Trump's administration is on the mission to strengthen exports of its fuelled ground gas to Europe and replaced Russia, which is much cheaper for European consumers.
To this end, officials of Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step away from the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which according to Trump made from Berlin's "repute" Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which is intended to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion meters above ground, is a purely economic project.
Kreml claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of some competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure development tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The U.S. has raised an interest in Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The largest German industry organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the United States to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state is involved in our energy supplies," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to "be close" to the presidential candidacy in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the elections in the middle of the election period, "a close look" at the presidential candidacy.
During the meeting of the Council in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the candidacy.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, including the top women's position," The Hill said.
"After November 6th, I will look closely at the presidential candidacy."
Warren also mentioned Donald Trump at the meeting and said that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I fear to the sea the bones of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was opened in his criticism of Trump and his appointment as Supreme Judge Bretta Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren on Twitter stated that: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
The poll published Thursday, however, showed that most of Warren's volunteers do not think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" volunteers from Massachusetts indicated that the senator should not run, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The research showed greater support for the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for the candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Another highly established democratic name, which was mentioned in connection with the potential candidate by 2020, is former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, says Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin at the meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year on the list in September in Iraq.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence
“What my own son is going through, what he is going through after his return, may concern other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are returning with,” said the audience at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palina called this arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other war veterans that "they are returning a little different, returning to healing, returning and wondering if there is any respect for the things their fellow soldiers and flighters and every other member of the army are giving their country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, interference in the report on domestic violence and the holding of arms in alcohol, Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighty states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of a new US government measure, which attacks asylum-stricken victims of gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the eighteen states and the Friday period in Washington issued a brief report on Friday to support asylum seekers and question this measure, the NBC reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which was given in August by the American Civil Liberties Organization against Federal Policy, was not revealed.
She said her partner "and his sons and members of the violent gang" abused her, but the US officials rejected her application for asylum on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum-seekers in the United States, as nations facing all kinds of problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States has reversed the decision of the Immigration Appeals Senate of 2014, which has enabled illegal immigrants who suffer from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In a Friday statement, Attorney General Karl Racine of D.C. stated that the new measure "neglects decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle," said a short friend.
The lawyers further briefly argued that the policy that denies immigrants' entry is damaging the US economy and says it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "give the necessary work".
The Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims who were ravaged by domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Assil is available for those who leave their country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a certain social group or political opinion," Sessions said in its statement of 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day throughout the world.
Zupalé rescue attempts in Pal, where the number of victims has already doubled, runs in search of survivors with time
For the survivors, the situation was worse and worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who enjoyed her hot boy at the evacuation center in the ravaged town of Pal.
“Every minute the cure will bring another body.
Pure water is rare."
The residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, picking themselves out of things they had been framed, and trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 were protected.
Some of the injuries, including Two Harris, who suffered from a breakup of the pancreas and shoulders, were resting at Palu's army hospital, where patients were treated outside due to ongoing severe subsequent shocks.
The tears filled his eyes as he felt that a violent earthquake had taken root in his hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared peace with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I think I was stuck in the wall," Haris told the Associated Press and added that his family was in town for marriage.
"I heard my wife was calling for help, but then quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're all right."
The United States Ambassador accuses China of "sicing" propaganda advertising
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the American newspaper, which focused on the mutual benefits of trade between the USA and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned a paid supplement to China Daily in the Register of Des Moines - the state of the biggest sales news in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to blend into US congress elections in the United States on 6 November.
The trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to get involved in the American elections indicated what American representatives said that the Reuters agency was a new phase of a escalating campaign by Washington to develop pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to report commercials to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in the escalating trade war, which occurs at the level of mutual imports.
Chinese legal sanctions at the beginning of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican side, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, a significant exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing injured American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a statement in the Sunday Des Moines Register that China now doubles this harassment by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"When spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a valuable American tradition of free speech and free press by placing pay advertising in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“Despite this, you will find limited inconsistencies in a newspaper station on the street in Beijing, and you will not see any real reflection of inconsistencies that the Chinese might have on China’s worrying economic path, given that the media belongs to the Chinese Communist Party.”
He added that “one of the most important Chinese news refused to publish the offer” his article, although he did not say which newspapers.
The Republicans leave their volunteers in front of the election for a debate with Kavanaugh, protect analysts
As many top Republicans defend the candidate to the Supreme Judge Bretta Kavanauga, who faces several charges of sexual assault, the analyst warned that during the upcoming elections in the middle of the period, they were aware of the response, especially from women.
The emotions surrounding this case were extremely high and most of the Republicans on the record are already saying that they want to continue with the vote.
These things cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University School in Syracuse.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for the last time trying to investigate the FBI would be enough to calm the voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and spokesperson for the Progressive Group MoveOn, newspaper in D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters called "November is approaching!" at a demonstration in the hall of the Senate, where Republicans who are concerned with the judicial commission decided to appoint Kavanaugha even through the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic stated.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivations will market records," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say it was high already, that's the truth."
However, it could be higher, especially among the women's prominent voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years of age who do not like the president, but often do not go to the elections."
Even before Ford’s public testimony, detailing her charge of sexual assault on the candidates of the highest court, the analysts suggested that, if the Republicans confirmed, they could follow up on the resistance.
"This was the result of the confused disorder for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It is not just about voting in committee or about final voting, nor about whether Kavanaugh is sitting on the table, it is also about how the Republicans managed and dealt with it,” said Guy Cecil, U.S. Prime Minister, a group that helps to elect Democrats, pointed to the reporting channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided in the view that they believe in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with some more sympathy for the second appointed.
A new survey by YouGo shows that 41 per cent of respondents were probably or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent stated that they probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh probably or probably lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake's FBI at the moment, he investigates the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, stated The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate judicial committee on oath last week that she was attacked by drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court showed her his genitalia at the party during his study at Yale University in the 1980s.
Web Finder World Wide Web plans to start a new internet and run Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technological legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the open source platform of Berners-Lee called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which people have access to information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the purpose of the Inrupt project was "world power."
"We have to do it now," he said about this startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Disk Google, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is exceptional on the online data storage site is that it is entirely up to the user to determine who will have access to some kind of information.
The company calls it "personal backup through data".
The purpose of the Inrupt project is, according to the Director-General of John Bruce, to bring the resources, processes and relevant skills to help Solid platform to be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, security platforms purchased by IBM, some employees working on the project cooperated on the project and community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team with “Facebook and Google do not talk about making a complete change, where all their business models are overnight turned upside down.
"We do not ask for their permission."
Berners-Lee, in his contribution to the media published on Saturday, wrote that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem that will help to protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The celebration of the clergy who received Victorian Cross during World War I
Hundreds of years have passed since the only Anglican spiritual church won the Victorian cross as a warrior during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglies and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, the shooter killed him, and he never realized that he had won the highest British military rating.
His two grandsons discovered his memory stone on Saturday during the celebration in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his lawyers, Michael Vann, said it was "genially symbolic", that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's victory.
According to London Gazette magazine, on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Vann led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very dense silence and a strong shooting of the field and towers."
Later, he got to the first line and with “the greatest courage” led the line forward before he threw himself into the fire field and knocked on three separate units.
Lieutenant Vanna killed the German shooter on October 4, 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather's actions were "something I would never do, but at the same time something that is humiliating."
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, who was led by a youth group of Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, they put up a wedding feast.
Michael Vann said that "he felt a great honor to be able to share in the audience," and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown by the support that many people give."
MMA fans stayed all night watching Bellator 206, instead of getting pig Peppa.
Imagine, you've been waiting all night for you to follow the overcrowded Bellator 206, just to resist your main event.
The San José account contained 13 points, including six on the main card and live broadcasts took place in the United Kingdom all night on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a match, the viewers in the United Kingdom were amazed when the news turned into a show about Peppa's pig.
Some remained unresolved after they had been in the early hours of the battle.
One of the fans on Twitter described a change in children's show as "a certain form of bad joke."
“In accordance with the government regulation, such content is not appropriate at 6 o’clock in the morning, and it is therefore necessary to send children’s series,” said Dave Schwartz, the senior vice president for marketing and communication to Bellator after being asked about this transfer.
"Peppa's name," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said they'd work on the program so that future audiences in the United Kingdom would be involved.
"I think that when I think about sending, we can probably handle it," Cooker said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to do it until Sunday of our time, Monday of theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of texts went back and forth and not all were exactly friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it could be the government.
I promise you it won't happen again.
We reduce it to five matches instead of six – as we usually do – and we tried all our power to keep the promises given to the fans and did not succeed.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "deserved" because of sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic water jumper, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to pursue success.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "not everyone is like him."
On the first radio 4 Desert Island Disc, who introduced Lauren Laverne, said he spoke out loud about gay rights to give the other "hope."
He also said that he was less interested in winning the Olympics because of the possibility of becoming a parent.
The regular moderator of the long-term Kirsty Young series had several months free of disease.
Daley, who appeared to be a part of Lavern's first program, stated that he felt "lesser" than anyone else who grew up with him, because "there was not socially unacceptable for you to like boys and girls."
He said: "So far these feelings of inferiority and differentness have been real things that have given me strength and power to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was someone, said not to disappoint anyone who might have found out what it was like with his sexuality.
The dual holder of the bronze Olympic medal became a fighter for the right to move LGBT with a high profile and took advantage of his presence in the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he called because he felt lucky that he could live openly without consequences and wanted to add “hope”.
This three-dimensional world champion stated that he was in love with a man – American film director Dustin Lance Blacka, whom he met in 2013 – “the start was unprepared.”
Daley, who was 20 years older, took it last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you were so young, he was at his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died three years later in cancer,” he said, “it was not easy to find someone of the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
Two of them adopted Robert Ray Black-Daley's son in June and Daley said that he "has changed the whole angle of view".
"If you asked me last year, it would be all in the style "I want to get a gold medal," he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after his brain cancer was diagnosed.
Daley said his father was not going to die, and the last thing he asked about was if they already had tickets to the London Olympics in 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him – you won't be in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and when he stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The year Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew I had dreamed of it all my life – jumping in front of the sights of our home in the Olympic Games, I don't know how to feel better," he said.
It also inspired the selection of his first composition – the Water Small – which reasoned with him at the start of the Olympics and still called for a bunch of skin.
Desert Island Disks is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 station on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mikkelson, who was out of shape, ended up on the bench on Saturday at Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson would get a record on Sunday when he played 47, the Ryder Cup game, but he'd have to put out a form to prevent that it was an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelsson, who played the event every two years with a double record, sent Captain Jim Furyk to Saturday's fourballs and foursomes on the bench.
Instead of being in the center of action as often as it was in the United States, he spent his five-digit main victory on Wednesday between the cheerleaders and the work on the game in a row that he hoped would fix what he had suffered.
This 48-year-old player has never been the closest of drivers, and it is not at the top of his career, so it is not the ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National field, where the long-term member of the field routinely punishs the wrong shots.
And if the golf course is not quite worrying about itself, Mikkelson is facing the British Open Francesco Molinari, which won all four matches this week with Tommy Fleetwood's new team.
If the Americans, who had four fewer points, had started 12 solo matches, avoided a quick performance, Mickelson's sword could prove to be absolutely essential.
Fury expressed his confidence in his husband, and he didn't give anything else.
"He just understood the role he had today, he hit me behind his back, he put his hand around my shoulder and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
“They believe so much.
He's a member of the Sinos, and in the past and this week he's been so successful for these teams.
I guess I didn't think he was playing two cats.
I imagined more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Fald's record in most of the Ryder Cup Westerns played on Sunday.
This could mean the end of a career in Ryder Cup, which never reached the height of his individual record.
Mickelson won 18 wins, 20 wins, and seven medals, even though Fury says his presence led to some unbearable results.
"He's fun, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make fun of people and he's a great partner in the team room," he explained.
“I think younger players also enjoyed the fun of walking after him this week, which was fun to watch.
He's giving it a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that a great lead towards singles from the last days in Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Dane started a match in 1997 in Valderram, where a company led by Captain Sve Ballesteros had a five-point drive over the Americans, but to the goal line they were given a complete victory of 141 1⁄2-131 1⁄2.
“You still have to remember that we had a big jump in Valderram, as well as in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderram where we won, but only closely,” said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching when in 2018 they won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to lead Le Golf National 10-6.
So the stories and every member of that team showed me that it's not behind us.
You'll be bored tomorrow.
Go there and do all the right things.
It's not after you until all those points are on the table.
We've got a goal, and that's what we're trying to get a trophy here, and we're focusing on it.
I said I'd focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to do on the other side – the best players in the world."
Bjorn, delighted with the way his players led in the complex golf course, added: “I would never manage it myself.
There's another animal waiting for us tomorrow.
Individual performances are being prepared tomorrow, and it's very difficult.
It's great to be out with a partner when it's good, but when you're going to be there for yourself, your golfer's capacity is fully checked.
It's a message that you need to pass on to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will take care of his players playing better as individuals than partners. Exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points from four.
Fury was personally on both sides of these great returns when he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn to end up as defeated when Europe reached the 'Medina Miracle'.
"I remember every damn word," answered the question as Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, encouraged his players to move to the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you would like to start quickly as in Brooklyn, as in Medina.
When this rate goes one way, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle-class matches.
According to this, we set up the assembly and made sure that the boys felt like you know, as if we were going to be magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of attempting to launch a counterattack and face Rorym McIlroy in the final match with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, which are the other Europeans in the upper half order.
“I went with the group of boys in this series because, according to me, it covers the whole way,” Bjorn said about his choice of singles.
Germany's new warship is still suspended
The latest German naval frigate was recognized in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but will not be available for at least one year because of the faulty systems and the snowy coast, local media say.
The export of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ ship, a completely new cargo of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, a speaker army.
The vessel was to become part of the shipping industry in 2014, but the serious problems with the delivery of this ambitious project were ignored.
As a replacement for the old-fashioned fleets of the Bremen class, four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will serve, which had already been ordered by the Navy in 2007.
It is clear that they will be equipped with an efficient work, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-fertilistic ballistics and certain hidden technologies, such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Another important function is the long maintenance period – the latest frags should be possible for up to two years outside the home port.
However, constant delays mean that the ship’s peaks – which were supposed to enable Germany to send forces into the sea – will become obsolete until the time of entry into operation, notes Die Zeit.
Neblaze announced the F125 Freight was released last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss fleet in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the manufacturer after the shipment.
It was only a little known about the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted a number of key "software errors and a metal element race" which would make the warship useless when it was launched.
Software failures were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship will operate a crew of 120 sailors – half of the workers who were needed on Bremen class frigates.
It has also shown that the ship has a considerable excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the shipping to add future innovation.
It is believed that 7 000 tons of Rhineland-Palatinate ship will be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the metal elements race, the cost of the whole project is also a problem – including crew training.
It is said that from the original 2.2 billion euros, the price has risen to EUR 3.1 billion.
The problems with the latest fractals were particularly significant in the light of recent warnings that German maritime power is declining.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, confirmed that the Navy really "comes with the ships' ability to set up."
This representative stated that the problems had been constantly packed because the old ships had been removed from operation but no replacements had been provided.
He complained that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg's crews are capable of being part of the marine equipment.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
On the site of bats at the Scottish High School, a new research is being carried out aimed at discovering how bats use the landscape when hunting for food.
There is hope that research findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and will help manage future activities to preserve this species.
The study carried out by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will be followed by bats of the stars and the smallest and shortest of the long and the watery in the botanical garden of Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special records will be placed in key areas in this unmanned site, which will monitor the activities of bats throughout the entire annual period.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings will detect the frequency of the call of bats and what individual species are doing.
Subsequently, a map of the habitat and the message will be published, which will create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, the NTS Natural Resources Conservation Adviser, hopes that the results will show what habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by individual species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of holes, and the best procedure for maintaining forested areas for bats and other related species.
Indiscriminate populations in Scotland and the entire United Kingdom are dying to a large extent in the last century.
They are threatened as a result of construction and territorial development affecting colonies and the natural environment.
The risk may also be wind turbines and lighting, as well as a drop in mosquitoes and chemical treatment of building materials and cat attacks.
The bats aren't really blind.
Because they hunt at night, however, they are more useful when hunting their ears than their eyes.
They're using an intelligent echo-location technique to get the pants and obstacles in the flight.
NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
He has trained experts who carry out regular surveys, colony controls and sometimes rescue work.
This organization has even set up the first and only outstanding non-citizen reservation in the residence of Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of non-citizens in Scotland.
The manager of David Thompson's residence says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Thrave we have a great area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and the best habitat.
But there's still too much we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need for survival."
It highlights the importance of monitoring bats before the start of maintenance work in the properties, as it is possible that the unaware destruction of one mother nest can kill up to 400 females and young people, which can destroy the entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, to trouble, destroy or destroy their colony.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to put her hand to work and help.
She said: "We do not know how to deal with their people, but we have to learn a great deal about them."
Ronaldo rejects the charges of rape and his lawyers are going to complain about the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo called charges of rape for "false reports" and stated that people "want to see" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German journalist Der Spiegel, who informed of these charges.
This Portuguese and youth attacker was accused of rape by U.S. Kathryn Mayorgy in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently he paid her $375 000 to inform Der Spiegel on Friday about the case.
A few hours after the publication of the indictment information, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers and identified the information as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the five-person appreciation holder of the Golden Ball in the camera.
“They want to live on my behalf.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they call my name, but it's part of their work.
I'm happy and I'm fine," said the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are going to complain about Der Spiegel's unsubstantiated charges, which they called "an unacceptable notification of suspicion in the private sector".
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player would claim compensation for “moral damage in the amount of the corresponding seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights lately.”
The alleged incident was to occur in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel apartment and at the casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the game, where she was reportedly raped by a court case in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo collapsed after the alleged incident and told her that he had failed at "99 percent" and at "one percent".
The papers say Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also announces that she went to the police and left to arrange photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed with the extrajudicial arrangement, because “she was afraid of kidnapping” and was afraid of “public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old woman claims that she is now trying to restore the proceedings because she is still traumatized by a alleged incident.
Ronalda, at the time of the charge of the attack, bought him a famous Italian Club Juve from the Royal Madrid Club from Manchester United and this summer for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will always regret the losses of car manufacturers
The Great Britain "will always be sorry" if after Brexit the world leader's status in the production of cars, the secretary for Greg Clark has been appointed.
He added that it is "anxious", that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at Burnston, near Derby.
"A deal is necessary," said Clark.
The Japanese car has stated that the impact of delays on borders in the absence of a Brexit agreement may be a job.
In the race in Burnaston, where Auris and Avensis cars are produced, the Toyota brands produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would notice stopping production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnston.
Other cars, including cars Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the United Kingdom, spread fear of leaving the EU without agreement as regards the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW indicates that it will close its mini car production race in Oxford just a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers label as a risk to the supply chain in the case of Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota’s production line is in operation on the basis of the supply of ‘right of time’, with parts from suppliers in Britain and the EU supplied for cars manufactured on order within 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom left the EU on 29 March without an agreement, it could be disrupted at the border, which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and lack of spare parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to have more than one day at the Derbyshire competition in the stock store, the company said, and this would lead to a stopover of production.
Mr Clark pointed out that Theresy May's plans for the recovery of future relations with the EU are "exactly calibrated to avoid these border checks."
"We need an agreement. We want the best deal that allows, as I say, not only the current success, but also the capture of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other producers is that we must be absolutely able to continue in what is a very successful supply chain now."
Toyota was unable to say how long the production will be stopped, but in the long run it warns that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the race and, finally, were also at work.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been in the Burnston race for 24 years and is chairman of the competitions, said that the members of the committee organisations are increasingly concerned: “I have the experience that once these places disappear, they will never return.
The Speaker's Government declared: "We have established a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The trumpet meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Advocate General Rod Rosenstein could be "a week away", because he continues to fight for the highest judge's post with Brett Kavanagh, told the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is attending the work of the Special Council of Robert Mueller, which examines the involvement in Russian elections, the link between Trump's supporters and Russia and the possible opposition from the President.
As soon as Trump leaves the representative general power and thus threatens Mueller's independence, the Washington bells have been on the grid for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times stated that Rosenstein was discussing the camera's recording of the conversation with Trump and the possibility of the president's meeting through the 25th Supplement.
Rosenstein's message has been rejected.
Last Monday, however, he arrived at the White House surrounded by reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced Thursday with Trump, who was then in the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump stated that Rosenstein would not "be better" but then the meeting was delayed so that she could not be heard by the Senate's judicial committee, where they gave testimony to Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday Trump ordered the FBI weekly investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, and the full vote of the Senate was delayed.
Trump's press spokesman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday in reports on the Fox channel.
She answered the question at the meeting with Rosenstein: “The date has not yet been set, it may be this week, it may be necessary to move for another week in view of all that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'll always tell the current information by the media."
Some reporters disagree: Sanders has not held a press conference with the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders stated that too few press conferences had been exposed to the "divage" of television reporters, even though she said, "I do not agree with the fact that it's coming out."
She then proposed that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press be increased.
"The President is holding more meetings with questions and answers than any president before him," she added, without giving any evidence. "We were looking at these numbers."
The conference will continue, Sanders stated, but “if representatives of the press had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would certainly be better than talking to me.
We've been trying this, and you've seen that we've been doing this in the last few weeks, and that there's a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly receives questions when leaving the White House or with open meetings or press conferences with visiting high officials.
Single press conferences are rare.
This week, the president in New York probably showed why he had a relaxed and sometimes bizarre view of the assembled reporters.
Ministry of Health writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland to avoid fear of Brexit
The Ministry of Health has written to EU employees who work in Scotland NHS to express their gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman's SME sent a letter not six months before leaving the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to raising the costs of applications for the status of EU citizens working in transferred public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “Over the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU continue to take place on the basis of a derogation, and are aimed at the expected decision this autumn.
However, the British government is also taking steps in preparation for a possible withdrawal scenario without agreement.
I know it must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to assure you once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of nationality.
EU-wide colleagues and beyond bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are beneficial to the patients and communities to which we provide services.
Scotland is absolutely your home and our desire is to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
The fugitive Tigers from Tennessee Christian Abercrombie took an emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury in Saturday’s 31-27 defeat by the rival Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessee said.
The chief coach of Tennessee Rod Reed told reporters that the injury had occurred shortly before.
"He came to the side row and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and health professionals put Abercrombie on the side line of oxygen and then put it on the plate and prepared for further evaluations.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had taken a surgical step at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no information on the type/extent of the injury" is available and that the State of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second in the red shirt, graduates the first season for Tennessee after the transfer from Illinois.
Before the game ended on Saturday, it had five total steps, which means a total of 18 steps in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher real estate tax when purchasing properties in the United Kingdom
A foreign buyer will be charged a higher real estate tax when he buys a real estate in the United Kingdom, and the money will also be used to help homeless people under the new Tory plans
This act will neutralize the success of Corby's knowledge aimed at attracting young voters
Increased duty on property will be paid for persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
An increase of £ 120 million per year is expected to help people without homes
Buyers from abroad will pay higher rent tax when they buy properties in Britain, and money will also be used to help people without a home, Today, Theresa Mayová announces.
This act will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's quest to attract young volunteers with the obligation to provide affordable accommodation and focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in real estate tax will concern individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the money will also strengthen the government's efforts to fight sleepless sleep over their heads.
The premium, which is an addition to the current obligation to pay the rent tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in other houses and the purchase for rent, may reach up to three percent.
It is assumed that up to £ 120 million per year will be raised in public funds.
Estimates say that newly built properties in London buy 13 percent of citizens who are not residents of the United Kingdom, which saves prices and makes it easier for first-time buyers to get on the map at home.
Many of the rich areas of the country, especially in the main city, have become "the cities of spirits" just because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new principles appeared only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called after he reduced the rent tax to help more young people to their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by taking up the land, but not using it, and insisting on Mrs. Mayo to collect quotas from affordable homes to correct the "nearness of home" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced the use of a number of housing reform proposals, including the management of rents and the termination of the "unusual" move.
He also wants to increase the power of committees to build new homes.
Ms. Mayová stated: “Last year, I said that I wanted to dedicate my efforts as a prime minister to the restoration of British sleep – to make every new generation have a better life.
And that means repairing our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life here.
However, it cannot be right to make it easy for subjects who do not live in Britain and for foreign companies to buy homes as well as hard-working residents of the United Kingdom.
For many people the dream of their own home is too far away and the crowd sleeping without a roof over their heads is too real."
Jack Ross: "My highest ambition is to drive Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross points out that his "highest ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scott is pleased with the challenge of restoring the North-East Club, which currently holds the third position in the First League, just three degrees below the top.
This summer he moved to the Stage of Light after bringing St. Mirren back the Scottish Premiership league last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B and that was it," Ross said on the BBC Scotland's Sportssound channel.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and that's always something that's gonna pull me back.
But this opportunity would come only if I was successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors were: Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Chief Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel any anxiety about the consequences of such names introduced in such a big club when he earlier rejected prejudices from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
“A success would be a question for me at that time if I could get this club back to Primer League.
The structure and equipment in this club are undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get him back there, but I think I'd be successful unless I could get the club back there."
Ross has been a career in management for only three years, previously acting as assistant chief in Dumarton and spent 15 months as a coach of Hearts.
Then he helped the club Alloa get back from retreat to the third group and transformed St Mirren from the beginning of the defeat to the title of the champions immediately in the next season.
And Ross says he has a much better feeling now than ever in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic clubs.
"They were probably real crucifixes," he recalls when Alloa was taken away.
“I really believed that leadership was right for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I was good, making good money and using reasonable heights.
But the game can be challenging.
There's a lot of things you have to spend a week.
I'm still going through them from the stress and pressure of the job, but I just have a good feeling in management.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I'm doing it, I feel like I've been feeling the most in my adult life in my skin."

Research found that a great time on the paint is Saturday at 17:30
The summer rain increased the revenue of British households facing difficulties, but increased the pressure on the chain of restaurants.
The figures show that households and bar groups recorded a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in July – but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from CGA’s consulting company, who produced the final news, stated: “The stable sunlight and longer than the expected participation of England in the World Cup marked that July followed a similar pattern as previous June, when the guests’ visit increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were even more affected.
The decline in restaurant markets by 1.8 per cent in June has worsened in July.
The houses and bars that are looking for drinks have so far been as strong as the restaurants have become worse.
The Lords whose main markets are from food also suffered the sun, although not as dramatic as the operators of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between controlled values and bars the sale of drinks rose by 6.6 per cent per month, while the sale of food by three per cent decreased."
Paul Newman, an analyst of leisure activities and hospitality, stated: “These results are a continuation of the trend that has been taking place since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sports events are the most important factors when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
It is no surprise that restaurant chains continue to fight, although the annual decrease in sales by 4.8 percent will be particularly painful in the light of current pressures on costs.
The long hot summer can't be a worse time for food-laundering business operators and time will tell if the milder temperatures that we experienced in August will bring so much needed relief."
Total sales growth in households and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the brand presentation.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitor for the British sector of households, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds, which is an industry measure in the sector.
Every fifth child has a secret account on social networks that hide from parents
Every fifth child, aged only 11 years, has a secret account in social networks that hides from parents and educators, shows research
Research among 20,000 high school students showed an increase in "false Instagram sites"
Reports raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students have stated that they have a “main” account they know about
Every fifth child, at only 11 years of age, creates accounts in social networks that lie in front of their parents.
A study of 20,000 pupils in high school showed a rapid increase in "false Instagram accounts", where photographs are shared.
News shows fears that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of students have stated that they have a "main" account they know about and at the same time have a private account.
One mother who attacked her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found that her teenage girl was urging others to "violate them."
Research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Association Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools showed that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-old students have two profiles, with half admitting that they have private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that he has so many teenagers trying to create online spaces where their parents and educators cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish athletic committee
Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Steering Committee.
Doyle is the most rated light athlete and President Ian Beattie has described the move as a great opportunity for those who are in the sport management like those who will benefit from her long experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Eilid has extensive respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that it will be very beneficial for the athletes in Scotland if he is a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am excited to be the voice of athletes and I hope to be truly successful and to help drive sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 and 400 metres in 1996 in the Olympic Games in Atlanta, won a total of four gold medals and is now a regular expert at the BBC, could not follow a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I suffered an attack a month ago.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that it would only be time to see if I was cured or to what extent.
It's exhausting, but I've been able to heal, he's learned to walk again, and today I can practice!
Thank you for all the encouraging news!"
Milk repellent requiring mother-to-cow comparison shares opinions online
The company involved in the production of the vacuum cleaner divided the online opinion of the advertising that compares the pregnant mothers to the cows.
As part of the launch of "the first silent portable transmitters in the world", Envi’s consumer technologies produced music videos showing the freedom that a new transmitter gives to pregnant mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay with cows on a song with the text: “Yes, I feel, but you don’t see any glasses” and “In case you don’t notice that I’m not pregnant, my breasts are here.”
The congregation continues: “Fumb, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, feed my sweet milk.”
An advertisement that was published on a corporate facebook page, however, triggered an online controversial reaction.
The video had 77,000 interviews and hundreds of comments and received mixed reactions from those who saw it, and many of them indicated that it sheds light on the "horror" of the dairy industry.
‘Very poor decision to abuse cows for advertising on this product.
Just like we have to be pregnant and give birth so they can give milk, but their children are taken a few days after birth," says one of the commentators.
The Elvie Disposal is discreetly attached to the breast (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “Probably traumatic for the mother and child.
But yes, why not use it to advertise on a breast pump for mothers who leave their children?"
Someone else added: "This advertisement is completely out."
They also found out who defended the advertising, and one woman admitted that the composition was considered "infectious".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd order the pump if I kept kicking.
I feel just like a cow when I'm leaving.
Advertising's a little crazy, but it's for business.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one user.
Another added: “It’s a fun advertisement focused on mothers who are sucking milk (often at work or at the toilet) and feel like cows.
It's not a commercial that's supposed to excite or destroy the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they all dance with discreet detachments hidden under the bra.
The concept of campaigning is based on the caution that many women who are sucking their milk indicate that they feel like cows.
However, Elvie is completely silent, has no wires and no wearers and is beautifully hidden into the bra on the pillow, so gives women freedom of movement, the ability to hold the child and even walk while driving.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD for mothers, added the comment: “Elvie is so revolutionary a product that she deserves significant and provocative marketing.
By creating a parallel between coarse mothers and lower cows, we wanted to point to the sending of milk and all the challenges associated with it, while showing a fun and reliable sense of freedom that the new dispenser will provide.
It's not the first time Elvie's detachment got off.
During the London fashion week, one of the two mothers, the designer Marta Jakubowski, who just used the product appeared on the mill.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to the state camp at the Texas border
The number of children detained migrants has increased sharply despite the fact that monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in particular because the hard rhetoric and principles introduced by Trump administration have led to the placement of children with follow-up.
Most accompanying immigrants were traditionally created without evidence, who were afraid of being threatened to stay in the country, so they claimed to belong to the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households must provide fingerprints and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who had requested the status of the escort of isolated unfavourables.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
As many as 80 percent of those who are sponsors or members of the sponsor's household are illegal in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue in their struggle," said Albence.
According to the workers of asylum facilities, representatives in an effort to process matters more quickly with regard to children have introduced new rules which will require some of them to be delivered before the court until the month before the detention, instead of the previous standard 60 days.
Many will appear through videoconferencing instead of declaring their case legal status to the immigration judge.
Those who do not have a warrant for help will be deported quickly.
The longer the child is in custody, the more likely he is to experience anxiety or depression, which may lead to outbreaks of the outbreaks of the outbreaks or attempts to escape, the workers of asylum facilities are claiming and reporting from the system over the last few months.
The lawyers state that these concerns have been raised in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where there are signs that the child is working, with greater likelihood of not being noticed, precisely because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the camp without having time spent in emotional preparation or disengagement with friends could lead to a trauma with which many children are already fighting.
Syria announced that they should download immediately US, French and Turkish "occupational components"
During the general meeting of the United Nations, foreign minister Valid al-Moual also called for the return of Syrian refugees home, even though the eight year war in the country has already taken place.
Moual, who is also a representative of the Prime Minister, said that foreign forces in the Syrian territory are illegal, under the pretext of combating terrorism and that “it will therefore be imposed.”
"They must give up immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moual claimed that "the war against terrorism in Syria is almost over", with more than 360 000 people and millions more died since 2011.
He said that Damascus would continue in "the battle of this holy battle until we rid all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "any illegally present foreigners."
In Syria, the United States has some 2,000 units, mostly of which are trained by the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs fighting with President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 units in the territory of a war-torn country.
In issuing refugees, Mouale stated that they had good conditions for their return and accused "some Western countries" of the "widening of national concerns", which caused refugees to refuse to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"Police what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no recovery aid will be available for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
The United Nations diplomats state that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a security zone in the last Idlib site created an opportunity to move forward in political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a major Syrian attack by Russian-protected forces in the province where three million people live.
Moual, however, pointed out that the agreement has "clearly the deadlines" and expressed hope that the military move will focus on the jihadists, including soldiers from Nusra Front, bound to Al-Qaeda, who will be "freed out."
The envoy of the United Nations Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition to the proposal of a military constitution for Syria and the postponement of the elections will take place.
Moual laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited "to the control of the articles of the existing constitution" and issued a warning before the move.
Why Trump Wins the Second Period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would also win in the next election in 2020, unless the hope of many liberal observers, the complaint and the early scandals of his office as President did not end.
In such a case, it would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finals of the presidential period in history!"
So far, there's no sign of surveillance.
Since 2014, monitoring in the main broadcast time has doubled by more than 1.05 million to CNN and nearly tripled by 1.6 million to MSNBC.
Fox News has an average follow-up of 2.4 million in the main broadcast time, which is an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC has increased monitoring on cable television to 3.5 million following the main night news.
"It's a fire that people love because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the operator of the "Designed Survivor" series on the ABC drama about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovellová, an experienced comedy author and series “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snaging Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another theory.
He recalls driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why?
"She said, "Because she's funny about him," Mrs. Scovellová told me.
It's the meaning of having fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story that is being played in the office of Washington could predict the future of Roe v. Wada, so that the immigrant families can be reunited again and in the interests of the global economy.
Disposal is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged observers.
However, it goes beyond the scope of whether you are an informed citizen, following a six-hour panel of experts, who discuss how Bob Woodward uses the "deep backup" source for his book "Fear", crushes Paul Manafort's leather bundles worth $15,000 (“adrogance clothing” mentioned by Washington Post) and the consequences of Mr. Trump's "anatomy" by Mr.
Besides, I'm not going to look at Super Maria the same way again.

Money outside the centre of the most narrow domestic competitions of the Middle Ages
It is not surprising that the 17th section of Pennsylvania, after a lively financial flow, was reorganized by the Congressional Districts, which generated two holders of the Office in the fight against the same chair.
This recently led to the transformation of the Pittsburgh district into the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which gained another section in the special election last year in the spring.
Lamb stands against another holder of the office, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily covered with a new 17.
After the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania issued an opinion in January that the old districts were permanently divided for the benefit of the Republicans, a map had been crossed.
In the new 17th district, the competition started a series of financial disputes between the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March special elections to the 18th Congressional District.
This chair was occupied by the Republican for more than a decade and Donald Trump won 20 points in the county.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight leap.
America considers encouraging Salvador to support China, then resigns
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under the mild pressure of Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was staying at the hotel in Panama until the partners had judicially moved out of Trump's organizational team.
The representatives of the foreign ministries decided to withdraw the US leaders of the diplomatic mission from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan further," spokeswoman Heather Nauertová stated in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
However, the sanctions were considered only against Salvador, which received US aid estimated at US$ 140 million in 2017, including drugs control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial assistance and aimed at limiting visas, would be for the Central American country and its high unemployment and the number of painful murders.
With ongoing internal negotiations, North American and Central American representatives have postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity linked to similar previous year's negotiations, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
By mid-September, however, the senior executives explained that they wanted to continue in the negotiations and effectively complete any proposed disciplines for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now entrusted with the resolution of the conference currently scheduled for mid-October, as part of a signal that the board of directors is putting in place.
And three American envoys returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without having any new unbridled news from Washington.
The White House speaker, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American representatives, including two diplomats, who agreed with the debate on internal negotiations on the conditions of anonymity.
Their sources were confirmed by an external analyst, who was close to the government executive and also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study history
The report by Robert Mueller from the Special Committee on the possible defence of Mr Trump in the exercise of his rights, which is now in the public records of many evidence, could be the definitive pitfall.
In his investigation, Mr Mueller reportedly turned to whether Mr. Trump's campaign did not contain a secret agreement with Russia regarding the attack on our elections.
If there was a foreign exchange in Congress, Mr Trump would have to submit to responsibility before this body, just as he is preparing to appear before the voters again, and finally the jury of his colleagues would have to wait for him.
This is a whole series of 'if', and I do not want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – as in similar policies in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice that will affect how long suffering will last.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to arrange a march against Hitler, only to be built and supported by Western powers in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of full bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such critical moments that speed up or slow down the inexorable pace of democracy.
The Americans are now facing a number of similar critical moments.
What are we gonna do if Mr. Trump throws out the place of Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, this is the man who's in charge of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been pushing it ever since the report announced that last year he proposed to secretly record the president and speculated that he was not in a state of health so that he could stop the president's office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the versions of The Times are inaccurate.
“How do we react if the newly requested F.B.I. Bretta Kavanaugh investigation is not complete or fair – or what if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite a convincing charge of sexual assault and false statements?
And what's more important, will we vote in the middle of the functional period to Congress, which will assign responsibility to Mr. Trump?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will wait a long dark night.
But I believe we're not going to make it, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and about 60 years later, she sent me on Saturday to light candles on a table with a pillow.
How could I not be optimistic about our future with such an inheritance?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic about shooting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers on Thursday of the Rapid Vienna guest, aware that the victory over the Rakušana would have given them a great hope for the process of the Group of the G of the European League after an impressive remix in Spain at the Villareal field earlier this month.
The knee wound prevented the depositary Graham Dorrans from appearing in the season for the first time until the remix of 2-2 with Villarreel. However, they believe that Rangers can use the result as a reflection bridge for greater things.
"It was a good point for us because Villareal has a quality team," said a 31-year-old player.
“We went to a fight with the faith that we could do something, and we took the point.
We may have been able to multiply it in the end, but the total remix was probably just.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second, we got better and we were better.
It will be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it'll be hard, because in the last match they've won a good score.
Last year was pretty hard, with all my injuries and changes in the club, but now I have a very good feeling about it.
The team's strong, and the guys are really enjoying it, and the training's fine.
I hope we get along with it now, put the last season behind our heads, and we'll be successful."
Women worry about retirement savings
Although the participants had a clear idea of how to care for them, few spoke to family members about it.
Half of the people in the nationwide study reported that they had been discussing the cost of long-term care for their partner.
Just 10 percent said she talked to her kids about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t decide to talk to him,” explains Holly Snyder, vice president of the entire country’s life insurance company.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care unless you first reveal your wishes.
Find out where and how to take care with your counselor and family, as these factors can play a major role in determining the price.
Admit your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you find a way to earn these expenses.
Long-term care can be financed by, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash life insurance, which will help you pay these expenses, or by using your own funds – while you have money.
Create your legal documents: Ban legal battles as long as it goes.
Identify your healthcare representative, which will be a reliable person who will look after your medical care and ensure that your doctor will comply with your wishes unless you are able to communicate yourself.
Consider, too, the description of full power for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make a financial decision for you and ensure that your accounts are maintained if you are not eligible.
Remember for details: Imagine that your old parent needs medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so you can be prepared.
"There are not only finances in the game, but, for example, what are the doctors called?" asks Martin.
“Where are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have that plan ready by hand."
A man in Ilfracombe was shot several times by an airman
When a man walked back home after a nightfall, he was hit by a few shots from the airfield.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon when it was shot in the chest, chest and arms.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "a necessary act".
The victim of the attack didn't count.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died during a severe earthquake and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. According to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to increase.
Since communication is out of operation, the auxiliary units could not obtain any information from the Dongal Regent, which is the area north of Pal, which is closer to the epicenter of earthquakes of 7,5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Pale after the disaster.
Here are a few key facts about the city of Paul and the Regent of Dongal, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the main city of the province of Central Sulawesi, which is located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi and its population was estimated to be 379,800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when they hit the earthquake and tsunamis.
It reached a regent stretching more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast on the northwest of the island of Sulawes.
Regentity, the administrative region under the province, had a population of 299 200 in 2017.
The main components of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Dongal.
In the province there is also an important exercise of nickel, however, which concentrates mainly on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawes in Morowali.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Dongal have already hit the tsunamis several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938 the tsunamis in Dongal killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Tsunami hit the west of Dongakly in 1996, when she asked for nine victims.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Withouti circle and is regularly on the ground floor.
Here is a list of several major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the northern part of Sumatra on December 26 caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries and prepared for the lives of 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in the province of Aceh.
2005: The series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the Sumatran coast.
2006: Earthquakes of 6,8 degrees hit them on the Indonesian most native Java island and caused tsunamis that hit the south coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: Earthquake of force 7.6 hit a degree near Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: Earthquakes of 7,5 hit one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra and caused tsunamis of 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and prepared for the lives of about 300 people.
2016: A slight earthquake struck the Regent of Pidie Jaya in the province of Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as people recalled the devastating effects of the earthquake and tsunamis of 2004.
This time, no sound formed, but more than 100 died because of falling buildings.
2018: The strong earthquake hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, where it killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin's arrested for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Alaskan governors and vice-presidential candidates Sarah Palin, was arrested for charges of assault.
According to a report issued by the agency Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, 29-year-old Palin living in the city of Wasilla in Alaska was arrested for suspecting domestic violence, violating the report of domestic violence and preventing arrest.
According to the police report, when his wife tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, she picked up the phone from Palina.
Palin was sent to Mat-Su Pretral Facility and is detained on an unsecured bond of USD 500, reports KTUU.
According to the network report, he appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared that he felt "solutely innocent" when asked for an opinion.
Fuel faces three Class A violations, which means it could be sentenced to a year's imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000.
At the same time, he was accused of a Class B offence, which was punishable by one-day imprisonment and fined 2000 USD.
It's not the first time that Palina has to face a criminal notice.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palina.
The alleged attack on the police reported his mother's phone call, Sarah Palin.
The case is currently before the Alaskan war veteran court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of violating the reporting of domestic violence, and of holding arms under the influence of materiel in connection with the incident.
He probably hit his girlfriend's face.
In 2016, Sarah Palinová was criticised by a group of war veterans when her son’s violent behavior linked to a posttraumatic stress disorder caused by his son’s service in Iraq.
Indian earthquake and tsunamis: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Earthquake of force 7.5 gradually caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are out of operation and are expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit directly on the shooting of the part of the island of Sulawes, located north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
The social media showed video showing a moment of horror.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand an exceptional death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in NYC
The federal prosecutors in New York are asking for the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York, where eight people died – an exceptional punishment that has not been granted for federal crimes in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly conducted an attack on the cyclone along the West Side Highway in the quarter of Lower Manhattan using the rented truck Home Depot, which had disrupted pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to defend the death penalty, the plaintiffs will have to prove that Saipov "intensely" killed eight victims and "intensely" caused a number of injuries – thus defining the conditions for the purpose of granting the death penalty according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York Court.
According to the court documents, both of these numbers would mean the possibility of granting a death penalty.
Several weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury accused Saipov of 22 criminal acts, including, for example, charges of murder in favour of extermination, which are commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "significant planning and preparation", claims the plaintiffs and describes the way Saipov acted as cruel, cruel and vicious."
“Sayfully Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, pain and loss to his family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleveland, Ann-Laure Decadtov, Darrena Drake, Ariel Erlijov, Hernana Ferruchi, Hernana Diego Mendozy and Alejandro Damiana Pagnucca,” is hereby named.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the court of the Southern District of New York last committed the death penalty.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but finally he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was actually executed in connection with the federal case in New York in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were repaired, which proved conspiracy for the purpose of espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs sat on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a relative from Uzbekistan, appeared in court documents during the days and months following the attack of minimal pity.
According to the police, he said he felt good about what he did.
According to Saipov's indictment, he told the authorities that he was inspired by the monitoring of the videos of the Islamic State on the phone to commit the attack.
The police also announced that they also demanded the expansion of the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital room.
He said he felt innocent about 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "evidently disappointed" with the decision of the plaintiffs.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting the confession of guilt and the condemnation of life without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of those events for anyone concerned," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team has already asked the plaintiffs not to demand the death penalty.
According to Members of the Conservative Party, Brexit NIGEL FARAGE should be entrusted with
During today's protest at the Conservative Party Conference, Nigel Farage committed to "mobilizing the people's army".
The former leader of the United Kingdom's independence party declared that the policy must be "pressed" by the Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May's own Members suggested, he should be conducting negotiations with the EU.
The honourable Conservative MP Peter Bone announced on his way to Birmingham that the Great Britain would be out now, if he was a secretary to Brexit Mr. Farage.
But the problem that Mrs May faces in the reconciliation of her ranks, where there is a deep gap, has still highlighted the conservatives fighting for a overthrow in the EU, who joined a self-defense protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan from the Chequers in the course of attacks on Brexit's troops, the forces of repression in the Union and the EU itself.
The allies insist that they will continue to seek agreement with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and will force Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between their package and their 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone said that the Leave Means Leave group was meeting in Solihul where he wanted to go to Chequers'.
He suggested to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for dealing with Brussels.
"If he were in the forehead, we'd be out today," he said.
The Ambassador Wellingborough added: 'I'll be in Brexit, but we have to get out of Chequers.'
To show his resistance to the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to listen.
In our own country we want to do our own laws."
Mr. Bone has rejected the proposals that the public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: 'The idea that British citizens would change their opinion and wish to put an end to is quite simple.'
Brexit's conservative stand Andrea Jenkins, who also took part in the march, told reporters: "I'm just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him and they don't like him as members of our party or our activists who are currently filling the streets for us to be elected at all.
Forget the Chequers and start listening.’
In a sharp report for Mrs Mayo, she said, 'The Prime Minister will keep his place when they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage stated that conservative policies must be "made into an unpleasant situation" if they want to betray their decision taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're standing here today to tell them we won't let you do that.'"
In the report he added: "I want our political class, which is in the area of Brexit, to feel pressure.
"Now we are mobilizing the army of the people of this country, which has given us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become independent and proud of the Great Britain, which will rule itself."
In the meantime, members of the Union were attending Birmingham and held two-hour meetings in the city centre.
Several activists had transparency of the Conservatives against Brexit after the weekend of this party.
Labour MP Lord Adonis laughed at the conservatives about the security problems of the party's application after the conference started.
"These are people who, according to their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus, for problem-free borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all fresh.
There's nothing like a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren is planning to think about the candidacy of the president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after November's elections "he will think about the presidential candidacy properly".
Boston Globe reports that a democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future on Saturday at a workshop in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, the frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is trying to re-election November against Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It felt in the centre of speculation that Trump could be built in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the volunteers at the workshop from the time Trump sat in the office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to withdraw from the Bureau of the President.
Warren said it was time for women to go out to Washington and make our broken government, which also means a woman in the highest position."
Suspect was arrested from shooting Simse from LSU
Police at Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that she had detained a suspect from Friday's shooting basketball player team LSU Wayd Simse.
The police department in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of 20-year-old Ditheon Simpson, at 11:00 Conference ET news.
A video from Friday's shooting was issued requesting the identification of a man captured on the recording.
Sims, 20, was shot on Friday in the early hours near the campus of Southern University.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound that didn’t work out with his life,” said police chief Murphy J. Paul via web 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to protect his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was moving on the scene, had a gun and admitted the shooting of Waydea Simse.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.

Great Price Russia: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of the world's champion when the team regime played in his hand victory over Sebastian Vettel
As soon as Valtteri Bottas graduated on Saturday before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes' team regime would play a major role in the race.
From the field of position, Bottas had a good start and almost got rid of Hamilton when in the first two races he ruined his position and called on Vettel to attack the team's partner.
Vettel went into the depot as the first one, and let Hamilton take the trolleys to the front of the group, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes driver went to the depot about a wheel later and was assigned to Vettel after the departure. However, Hamilton stepped forward and in the close battle the Ferrari driver had to leave the inner road free so that he could defend himself in the third round after the double manoeuvre.
Max Verstappen came out of the back row of the field and at the end of the first round he was in charge on his 21st birthday.
Then he led a large part of the race because he held the original tyres as long as he could focus on the fast finish and could take Kim Raikkonen's fourth position.
Finally, he went to the depot in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he could no longer increase the pace and Raikkonen remained the fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri's been doing a great job all weekend, and when he got a warrant, he was acting like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done fantastic work and the reward is the first two places," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad word of the body.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at the Saturday meeting because she insisted that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During his speech at a meeting in West Virginia, he did not mention directly the statement given to Ford before the Senate's judicial commission, instead of declaring that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "bad and rebellious and false."
“One thing that could happen, and the wonderful thing that is happening in the last days in Senara, when you see the respect when you see those people being angry and evil and resistance and slander,” he said.
“When you look at the issue and the publication and they tell you, "Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, can you escape for that?
Remember her answer... you published the document – ,ah, ah, what?
Oh, no.
She didn't publish it."
Well, wait a minute.
We published... no, that's not," he added and imitated the senator.
Feinstein sent Ford's letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh in July and the information escaped early in September – but Feinstein refused to leave her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's call, nor did I disclose information about the case," said Mr. Feinstein, as The Hill informed him.
"She asked me to keep everything secret and I did exactly what she asked me to do."
However, according to her words, the president, who expressed himself at a meeting on Saturday night, said: “I will tell you that this is a serious wrong speech.
Maybe she didn't, but anyway, it's the worst word of a body I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, which three women accused of sexual harassment, and indicated that the Democrats used these accusations for their own purposes.
‘The decision is to take too much back any available means.
You see the subspecies, the daringness, they don't care who's going to hurt, who's going to have to dive into the country to get back to power and to corroding," the Mediaite president quoted the words.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made a Friday victory in the elite league against Belfast Giants won a Saturday party in Dundee, which ended 5-3.
Giants were soon caught by two-legged leadership thanks to Patrick Dwyer's and Francis Beauvillier's attacks.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie managed to settle for home before Dwyer returned the Giants lead.
Francois Bouchard then again compared the two branches of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen to their victory.
It was a third defeat in the Elite League in the season for the Adam Keefe team, which managed to defeat 2-1 in Belfast Dundee on Friday.
Both teams met in the season, with all three previous matches controlled by the Giants players.
Dwyer's first branch came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, for Kendall McFaull's assistance, while David Rutherford signed up for Beauvilleer's second goal four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got home to play back at 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt prepared a goal for Cownie, who compared it at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, Giants went to the cabin for the first break only in the lead when he recorded his second goal at the end of the first third.
Homes were regrouped and Bouchard managed to re-balance the goal of the mission game at 27:37.
The joint work of Cownie and Charles Corcoran later helped Nielsen first in the game to stop leading to Dundee and the tennis player assured his team's leadership in half of the final third.
Giants, who have now lost fourth of the last five matches, will play another match at Milton Keynes on Friday.
The air traffic controller died to enable hundreds of people aboard the aircraft to avoid earthquakes
The leading air traffic in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he died, watching to make sure that the aircraft can safely fly with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a large earthquake that caused tsunamis on Friday.
The strong subsequent shocks flooded the area, and many people remained trapped in the trouble of the city of Paul.
But although his colleagues of twenty-one-year-old Anthonyus Gunavana fled to save their lives, he refused to leave his place in the wild with the driving tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pal.
He remained in his position to make sure that the flight Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at the time on the edge, could safely fly.
Then he jumped out of the control tower down when he thought he was dry.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, spokesperson for air traffic management, told Australia ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter transport from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, where he was transferred to a hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, this morning he died before the helicopter reached Paul.
"Our hearts are broken by this report," he added.
In the meantime, the responsible authorities expressed concern that the number of deaths could reach thousands. The Agency responsible for disaster management indicated that access to the cities of Dongall, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths continues to increase, as many bodies remain unexplained under the scourge and many of them still have no survivors," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The waves in the devastated Palu reached a height of up to six meters. In the city they will carry out mass funerals on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft are entering the affected areas of assistance and delivery.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said at Sky News station: “Every minute the ambulance brings in other bodies.
There's a lack of drinking water.
Small stores are stolen all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find in the place.
It's a tragedy, but it could be even worse."
Indonesia’s President Yoko Widodo came to Paul on Sunday and told the country’s military personnel: “I ask you to work day and night and complete all the tasks you need to evacuate.
Are you ready?" CNN introduced.
Indonesia was hit this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that one person is missing after the plane crash in the pond
The air carrier flying in a cabin on one of the Micronesian islands in the Pacific now stated that one person was missing, at first stating that all passengers and crew with a total of 47 persons safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in the press report that on Saturday afternoon she was unable to find a traveling man.
The airline reported that it cooperates with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in the search for a lost man.
The air carrier did not respond immediately to the requirements for the provision of details of this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane entered the water while attempting to land on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, the officials claimed that seven people had been transferred to the hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in the investigation on Saturday and were all in a stabilised state.
What caused the accident and the exact outcome of the event, however, remains unclear.
The U.S. airline and shipping company stated that the aircraft arrived in the camp even before the landing route.
Some witnesses thought the plane was passing by.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was landing at very low altitudes.
"That was very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes further stated that along with the others, he managed to get water through a deep stream to the emergency exits of the aircraft.
He added that the crew panicked and yelled and that he himself suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that mariners who worked close to the port mollusks helped to rescue by means of an inflating boat that was transported by passengers on the coast, even before the aircraft sank to about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that over the last two decades, aircraft with a total of 111 people were killed in the crash, but no accidents occurred in Air Niuguni.
An analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The complaint ended on Saturday in this case in which a man is repeatedly sentenced to the burning of a woman living in Mississippi in 2014.
The US Ministry of Justice in person of his analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours and provided expert judgements in the field of intelligence analysis.
An analyst for the jury planned a scenario how he used records from the phone 29 accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett stated that he had obtained localization data from several mobile phones, which showed that Tellis was on the night of her death in Chambers, which was contrary to his previous statement, he introduced The Clarion Ledger.
When it was found that he spent the night with Chambers on the phone, he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, and then he visited the police.
Sanford stood before the courtroom and testified that the day in question was not in town.
When the plaintiffs asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said, "I'm lying because my car was in Nashville that night."
Another accident was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
However, cell phone records indicate that the two knew each other only for a week.
Rowlett stated that shortly after the death of Chambers Tellis he removed the text messages Chambers, calling and contact information from his phone.
"He took her all out of his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the case to be brought before the jury later that day.
High Breed: What's a conscious hip hop?
Hip hop's trio wants to deal with negative opinions on this genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The Chapel of High Breed from Bristol claims that the hip hop has moved from its beginnings with political messages and solutions to social problems.
So they want to go back to the roots and repopulate the conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have recently met with the revitalization of artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the United Kingdom.
Another black girl?
Newer complains a couple of his release after a "racist" text report
A New Yorker complains about her discrimination after receiving a missent text message from her mother, in which she was marked as a "more black" text message.
A few refused to be racist and compared the complaint with the "broadcasting".
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, the mother of two children, expressed her fears when the first day at work in 2016 found that her new educator, Giselle Maurice, was black.
“NOEEEIÉÉÉÉÉÉ, OTHER DENMARK,” wrote P. Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in the textual report.
However, instead of sending her husband twice, Maurice sent her a drink.
When she understood her false passport, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman, who was "angrily concerned", threw Maurice away and said that she was just leaving the educator who was African-American, was working really badly and that she was expecting the Philippines instead, he introduced the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received a salary for one job and was sent to Uber's house.
Now Maurice complains about compensation for work out and asks for a compensation of $350 per day of a six-month commitment for which she was initially hired, even though without a contract.
"I want to show them that this is not happening," the post said on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
However, the two returned the impact that they were not racist, but that the termination of Ms. Maurice's employment was an appropriate measure, because they were afraid that after that insult they could no longer believe her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are no racists," said her husband, Joel Plasco, post.
“But would you place your child in the hands of someone to whom you looked down on, even though it was wrong?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the complaint to the “stupid” and stated that his wife cared for only two months of her old child and was in “a very difficult situation”.
"Would you like to drive for someone like that?
It's not a nice thing at all," the investment banker said.
Even though the judge still persists, the jury on the social media quickly condemned the two of them for their behavior and logic.
The editors of the stories about the bear Paddington feared that readers would be incompatible with the speaker's bear, showing the latest news.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, told the reporter: “It is difficult to feel the situation of someone who reads it first, even before it is published.
It's very fun to know, but now that we know the great success of Paddington's bear."
She stated that her father, who worked as a cameraman for BBC, before being inspired to write a children's book on a small fly bear, was very disappointed that his work had been rejected, added on the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book, which became a "sweet" stream after his death last year.
To Paddington, described as “a very important member of her family”, she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"I was a very quiet person, never was any exaggeration," she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child that achieved something you can really be proud of.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success with that look.
Even though it was his only creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all his achievements to Paddington."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After arrival, her daughter was quickly transferred to Louise Pasteura 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
“He called me regularly to tell me that it was really wrong and that he didn’t expect to get out of it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"But I should have called from Nada, where she told me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's how I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be there soon.
I'll be there with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart moving slowly lost her effectiveness and left her body.
She died shortly after, and it was like everything was closed.
I just had to sit there and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it in me."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, now suffering the loss of her daughter, entered the plane along with the other passengers, without revealing what a difficult test is just going on.
"No one knew," she said.
"I kept my head shut, all the time running down my face.
It's hard to explain, but it was just during the summer when I felt amazing understanding for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Persevering women send their glances to prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women who lost loved ones as a result of suicide cooperate to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending the views of the Welsh Bridge with inspiration messages and phone numbers on which people can look for support.
Mrs. Davis' son was only 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and, as a result, took his own life in 18 years.
"I don't want any other parent to feel what I felt every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said that her son was given a young cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile could shed light on every room."
However, he left his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place”.
In 2014 Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found the impenetrable body of his relative after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis says: “I am constantly afraid of what it will have to do with his life.”
“ To inform people that they have people who are willing to help them and who can talk to them, even if it is about their friends, ” said Mrs. Davis.
Don't sit still – you need to talk."
Mrs Humphreys, who is the flying friend of Mrs Davies, lost Mark, who was her 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother died.
"Nothing told me she was feeling at the bottom, or depressed, at all," she explains.
“A few days before Christmas, we observed a change in his behavior.
It was the worst day – when the children opened the presents, and they didn't look at them, nothing."
She stated that her partner’s death was a tremendous trauma to them, but that she had to get through it gradually: “This can make a real hole in the family.
It broke us up.
But we all have to go on and fight."

The future of Bretta Kavanaugh depends on the balance of how the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought we could get something we actually asked for – a limited-time investigation, with a limited extent – we could introduce a little unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would "disappear" because both sides would be buried in the interests of the parties.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to start an investigation?
Their resistance is well timed.
Elections in the middle of the election period are only five weeks away from us, November 6, and if the Republicans are mistakenly expected, this will lead to their fundamental weakening in trying to get the man requested to be sent to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush phoned the senators, lobbyed them for Mr. Kavanagh's support, who worked in the White House for President Bush, and through him met his wife Ashley, who was then Bush's personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI gets his message?
The Senate will vote on this and there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear, however, whether Mr Kavanaugh in the Senate can obtain at least 50 votes, which has enabled Vice-President Miku Pence to break the motion and confirm it at the Supreme Court.
Number of refugees from North Korea after Kim "defeated"
The number of refugees from North to South Korea has decreased since the beginning of the Kim Chong-Un government seven years ago, the South Korean legislator claims.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Union Ministry, stated that in the last year there were 1127 flights – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park further stated that more stringent controls are being carried out at the borders between North Korea and China and higher rates of required passports at the borders.
Pchjongangang has not issued any public declaration to that effect.
The vast majority of refugees from the North today receive an offer for South Korean citizenship.
Saul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border.
Most of them run across China, with which North Korea has the longest border and is easier to cross than in the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between both Koreas.
China faces refugees as illegal migrants, not as refugees, and often is forced to return.
Relations between the North and the South – which are still technically in the war situation – have improved significantly in recent months.
This month, leaders of both countries met in Pchjongang for talks that focused on stopped denuclearization.
This was the historic June meeting of the US President Donald Trump and Kim Chong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on extensive conditions of cooperation in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong accused the United States of failing to make any progress on the issue of sanctions.
"Without any trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way to cease to arm ourselves unilaterally," Ri said in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosiová called Bretta Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said it was inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court
The leader of the democratic minority, Nancy Pelosiová, called the candidate of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh "hysterical" and stated that due to its temperament it was not suitable for the service of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this comment in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could not help myself, but if any woman had performed such a show, she would be called "hysterical," Pelosi said in her reaction to Kavanaugh's fourth statement before the Senate judicial commission.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected all the charges that he sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at the time they were both in puberty.
during his opening words, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost screaming and excited about his family and his years at high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and stated that their accusations against him were "grape and coordinated" organised liberals who were unable to pass through Hillary Clinton's death in the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi stated that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he was unable to work at the Supreme Court because he showed that he was suspected of being against the Democrats.
"I think he himself has been disqualified by these declarations and by the way he supported the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosí answered no to the question of whether to seek the withdrawal of Kavanaugh in the event of his confirmation, even if the Democrats had received majority representatives in Snowfall.
“I will tell you this – if Congress is not telling the truth, then he is not qualified not only for work at the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he is working now,” Pelosiová said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about the potential results of Kavanaugh in court at the Law on Acceptable Care or Roe vs. Wade, because it was considered a conservative judge.
As part of the hearing of his previous confirmation in office, Kavanaugh avoided the answer to the question of whether he would have failed to comply with any decision of the Supreme Court.
"There is no time for a hysterical person to go to court and expect us to say "Jee, that's beautiful," said Pelosiová.
And women have to control it.
After verbal accidents, months, and years of drought, she was unable to escape without crying.
"We cry when we have a relationship," Mrs. Steinem told me about 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, don't I?"
She continues: “I was helped by a woman who was working with a director and who told me that she was also crying when she had a relationship, but she developed a certain technique, which means that when she had a relationship and started to cry, the person she was talking to said: “You may think I’m crying because I’m sad.
But I'm right."
And that's how she kept doing it.
And I think it's great."
The tears are acceptable as a means of reaction to anger, partly because they are not understood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job, where I worked in an office where men were dominated. I once expressed my indescribable attitude with tears, but the older, always cold manager, who was always a little worried, caught my neck and dragged me to the backyard.
"Never tell them you're crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're right.
He thinks you're sad and they'll be happy to have you."
Patricia Schroeder, once a democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught up in a non-marriage affair aboard the Monkey Business ship and had to get out of the fight. Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not explore the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
"It wasn't a well-thought decision," she said with a smile after 30 years.
"It has already run seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow and Seven Pockets."
Because the campaign has been running for a long time, it has not been able to take a step towards obtaining contributions, and it has committed itself to not getting into the fight unless it reaches USD 2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to the male candidate would only give her $250.
"Do you think I'm going to get a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally carry out the campaign, she was completely overcome by her emotions – as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with a system that made it difficult to obtain money and focus on the voters rather than on delegates and from the relationship to sexism, that she was fully involved.
"You might think I was nervous," Mrs. Schroeder said about how the press reacted to her.
“And maybe you would think that my main sponsor was Kleinex.
I remember thinking what they might write me on the tombstone.
"Palakala?"
Why can Chinese-American trade war be good for Beijing
The initial wave of trade wars between the United States and China was alarming, and even though the battle is not far off, according to experts, the gap between countries is long-term beneficial to Beijing.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, gave the first warning this year by issuing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
Most of the most important escalations, however, saw the world's light this week, when new tariffs for goods were announced at USD 200 billion (GBP 150 billion), which basically means taxing half of China's exports to the USA.
Beijing has always responded, with a recent five - to ten - percent reduction in customs tariffs from US$ 60 billion.
China was trying to pay the US the same coin, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world would fall on its knees.
Even if China wanted Washington to return to its original rounds, it would mean meeting his requirements, but the public details of the US requirements would be totally humiliating for Chinese President Si qiin-pching.
Even so, experts believe that if Beijing managed to play its cards correctly, the US trade war could positively support China in the long term because it would reduce the interdependence of these two economies.
"The fact is that a rapid political decision by Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would leave economic development in both countries. This is much more dangerous than observers have so far allowed," said Abigail Grace, a research collaborator focusing on Asia in the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, foreign minister
Syria claims that it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and appeals for assistance in rebuilding the country's more than seven-year war.
During the talk at the United Nations Foreign Minister Valid al-Moual at the Valne Assembly, he stated that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today's situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas of destroyed terrorists to a normal state.
All the conditions for voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism are now met, as well as the unilateral economic measures that have focused on their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that Syria has left more than 5.5 million inhabitants since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country with the need for humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moual stated that the Syrian regime welcomes any assistance in the construction of a devastated country.
However, he stressed that we do not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries sponsoring the rebels.
Europe has responded firmly to the victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
The Evria team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the US team with the final score 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National team on the edge of the difficulty in France.
The United States has now lost its sixth in Europe, so it has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again won a crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn with his team reached 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The United States Star, Phil Mickelson, who suffered most of the tour, then fired the ball into the water for 3 pairs of 16 jackets and left Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari then stared in all his wheels and became one of 4 players and achieved the best result 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was approved in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 players of the European team with the lowest score, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most rated player Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter from England, who successfully graduated from his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, Spain Sergio Garcia became the best European player with 25.5 points gained in his career.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t help today.
It's been a tough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy, I'm really happy I got the cup back.
Everything depends on the team, I'm glad I could help," Garcia said after the victory of Europe.
He gave a gift to his countryman John Rampo, who defeated the American legend of Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching this guy," Rahm, 23 years old, said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now recorded career record 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics of one of the best players of all time, which won 14 of the greatest titles, which can only be compared to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find a fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the final golf course during the entire tournament.
“ I’m really proud of the boys, ” said Captain Jim Fury after his team’s unsatisfying results.
We really warmed Europe this morning.
We really didn't make it.
I'll take my hat off Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
Let's regroup and, in cooperation with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee, move forward.
I like those 12 guys, I'm glad I could make them a captain.
I really need to get out of here.
You beat us."
