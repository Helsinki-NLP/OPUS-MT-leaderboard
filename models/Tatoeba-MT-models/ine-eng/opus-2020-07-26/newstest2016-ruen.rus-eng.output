The social map of Ivanov area is recognized by electronic means of payment.
The changes provide for the maintenance of a public passenger transport allowance.
As of 24 September, the arrangements for the voluntary travel of citizens have changed with the use of the social map of the Ivanov region.
As reported by the press service, the Government of Russia on the Ivanov area of change provides for the maintenance of a public passenger service allowance and provides a social map calculation scheme in accordance with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 of the National Payment System.
However, the social map of Ivanov area is recognized by electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application are changed.
Thus, the filling limit is now not established on trips, as before, but in cash, with winter and summer periods - not more than 400 rubles, not more than 800 rubles per month in the summer.
The social card holders will now need to track, not the number of left trips, but the balance of money.
The cost of a favourable trip for citizens will be 1/2 of the fare of the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of the trip is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The timetable for filling the social card with money remains the old one, from 24 numbers in the previous month to 23 numbers in the current month.
The new social card travel arrangements will have a number of advantages.
Thus, a detailed account of the spending of money on a social card appears to be available, with a copy of it.
In addition, there is the possibility of returning the assessed but unencumbered money.
Let us also add that the calculation scheme with carriers becomes transparent, as now half the cost of travel is paid by citizens, and exactly the same amount is paid to the carrier.
No commission will be taken when money is placed on the map.
In turn, Vasili Silkin, Deputy Chief of the Department of Road and Transport of the Ivanov Region, reported that more than 33 million social trips were made in 2014 in the region, and nearly 25 million in 2015.
In the area budget, more than 470 million rubles are provided for the benefit of citizens using the social card.
As of 1 September, more than 312 million rubles were recovered.
At the time of the 911 call, the teacher was recognized in the murder of a friend
During the call in 911, almost without a uniform, the coach Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his friend and that he needed staff to come home.
Lamb pointed out that there was a dog in the house, who was alive, but probably upset, and said that contact with family members could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a note handwritten on the white sheet of the paper: "I'm very sorry, I would like to return it all, I loved Amy, and she was the only woman who ever loved me," says the note, according to the representative of the body signed by Lamb.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who took two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had managed to travel 300 miles to a university campus where, according to the police, he shot all the respected history teacher of Ethan Schmidt at the threshold of his office.
The Chief of Police at Delta Lynn Baford State University reported that the university staff were informed of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that real call in 911 shortly after that.
By the end of the day, the victims will have one more: Lamb has killed himself as soon as the police have surrounded him.
The next day, after the shooting at the school had forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, the staff of the authorities were still trying to put in one picture the motive behind Lamba.
Information shared by investigators on both sides of the state, as well as by students and staff who knew him, helped to form a portrait of a talented but perhaps concerned teacher.
The students told me that they were looking forward to his work.
The police in Gote, where Prentiss died, reported that he was not charged with violence or criminal offences.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in his written book, in which he expressed appreciation for the "beautiful people" with which he was able to overcome in his teaching life.
Both of them taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 teachers, and many students attended lectures of that and another.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
One student who called Lambe, Brandon Bevers, said he seemed nervous and nervous, "like something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that at the end of the 2014-15 school year, Lamb told him about how he struggled with stress.
Earlier Lamb asked Delta State University to grant him sick leave, said he had some health problems.
He taught only two online courses this year.
Recent changes in university admission rules meant that the doctor's degree over which Lamb had worked so hard would not guarantee him automatic receipt of the teacher's post.
The president of William Laforz University reported that he knew nothing about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "evidently Mr. Lamba had something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
The police attacked Lamb after his escape from the camp when he was sent back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot 38 caliber from his truck gun in the backyard of his home, in one mile south of his parents ’ home in Greenville, Mississippi, reported the coroner of Washington Metel Johnson.
His engine car was still on the road.
Immediately it was not clear why Lamb had come to this house, although, according to Johnson, she believed that he knew the people living in it.
Lamb grew up in those areas.
Lamb began working at a university of 3,500 students in the city with a population of about 12,000 in 2009, teaching geography and pedagogy.
He received the degree of doctor of pedagogical science in the spring of the same year.
One of the ancient friends of Lamb described him as a wise, charismatic, and cheerful man.
Carla Hayston told me that she was 15, and Lambo was 20 when they met through common friends.
She and her friends studied in high school, and he was a classmate older, who had been trying to learn to play her guitar for years.
In those years, he enjoyed success for women.
All the girls were hiding when he was around," says Harrison, who is now 40 and who lives in Jackson, Brandon's town.
Lamb and Prentiss have been dating for a while.
At 911 Lamb's call, he said, "I killed my wife," but there's no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Leitning, who lived with them in Gote in a surgical house whose back is on the channel.
According to the police, the dog's fine.
The ex-husband Prentiss, Sean O'Stin, reported that they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and that they have a daughter who is 19 years old now.
"She's too old," said O'Stin about the daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he didn't meet Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and was playing blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both attended a summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at the concerts.
O'Stin told me his daughter wrote music and poems.
Prentis was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Schaffer, a bartender and co-ordinator of entertainment programs in the dark-lighted bar The Julep Room in Gottie, said that the last time he saw Lamb and Prentiss on the evening of September 5th, when Lamb finished playing guitar and a lost charm for a few visitors.
There was no suspect.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We had fun and had fun over each other.
In the sense that they were both very sharp.
Schmidt, the dying teacher, held seminars for the first class and specialized in the history of indigenous Americans and colonial America, told Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher in the same educational institution.
He was married and he had three little children.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of the Student Brotherhood and Student Self-Government.
At Delta State University campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and members of the community, participated in a memorial ceremony for the burning of candles.
The wife of Schmidt Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the University choir played the Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Work will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," said Laforz.
Crisis's gone.
Today's healing.
Amy and Rohelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped to prepare the authors of Associated Press Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with the police's statement that the Lamb's call had taken place in 911 after the murder of Schmidt, and that, although Lamb had spoken of him as his wife when he called 911, no information had been confirmed that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us announced that he would not hire as many staff for the holiday season as he did last year, while the children's toy and goods Riddler assured that he would allow staff and temporary staff to work more hours.
The company reports that it plans to employ 40,000 people to work in shops and optical bases throughout the country, which is less than 45,000 who were hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company reported that it would begin interviews with applicants this month and would increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although a few more months before the holidays, the purchase season is getting closer, and companies are ready to hire temporary staff to have enough state in stores and to sell, download and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox is kidding about "welcome" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of the film Back to the Future was a great event for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the arrival of the royal family, and I noticed that the place next to me was free, and here I was betrothed - next to me will be Princess Diana," he told in a trailer to the soon-to-be-screen documentary "Back in Time."
It's a movie, and here I'm in my head, that I'm literally out of hand and in a fake rabbit since I met Princess Welsky.
"Back in Time" is a documentary on "Back in the Future" film, which includes an interview with Fox, Lee Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spillberg.
The film premiere "Back to the Future" took place 30 years ago.
"For me," says Spielberg, "it's no doubt the biggest movie about travels at a time that has ever been taken away."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in some theaters in October.
UN chapter states that there is no military solution in Syria
In response to the Russian military support of Syria, the Secretary-General, Mr. Pan Ki-moon, stated that there was “no military solution” for the nearly five-year conflict, and that the increase in arms would only increase violence and suffering for millions.
The UN chapter again called upon all participants, including the UN Security Council, to join and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Mr. Gui Moon said at the press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent members of the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that differences in the Council, as well as among the Syrian and local authorities, had " made the situation unsolved".
Mr. Gui Moon called on five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they had demonstrated in addressing the nuclear programme on Iran and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 survey results showing Donald Trump is not kidding.
Some have tried to wear a provocator’s label on it.
Others turned away from him, accepting as a joke.
And some need a scandal.
But no matter how some Republicans try to undermine Donald Trump's high position in the polls, they have failed to do so.
Ten of the last 11 national surveys have demonstrated the advantage of Donald Trump in two-digit figures, and some are starting to question seriously what this means for a magnet of real estate from the point of view of getting a nomination.
Of course, it's just the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to name the Republican Party.
The experts point out that in 2011, Rick Perry gave up his prestigious German-Caine popularity, none of which won one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in the general election.
But external groups, such as the Jeba Bush Superintendent Committee, and the conservative economic group, the Growth Club, recognize the unsatisfying force of Trump and begin to deliver their dollars to challenge him.
Here are some of the survey figures that say that real estate magnets are not just an intermediate phase:
Sympathy ratings for the Trump ranged to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his application in mid-June, a survey at Monmouth University showed that only two of the 10 Republicans had a positive impact on this magnet in the area of real estate.
By mid-July, it was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 per cent.
Six out of 10 Republics are now positive for Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these indicators go up in the initial stages.
The Quinnipiac survey in Iowa last week found that 60 per cent of the population there had a positive impact on Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voting would establish Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 per cent of the Republicans said that they had either "belonged" or "satisfaction" if Trump had become a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "distorted" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent say that they would be "strong" against 40 per cent of those who say the same thing about Trump).
The next level of intensity?
Marco Rubio, only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republicans say they will be "unsatisfied" or "unsatisfied" if the Jab Bush Festival's favorite will become a candidate.
Most Republicans do not consider the temperature of Trump to be a problem.
While the Trompa has been criticised for its praise and insults, 52 per cent of voters from all over the country think that the magnet has a suitable temperature to be the president, as shown by the ABC News/Washington post survey on Monday.
The same figure represents the first closed assembly in Iowa, where 52 per cent of the same Republicans believe that he has the same person as the chief commander, as Quinnipiac said last week.
However, 44 per cent believe that he is not the person who can be effective at the post, and almost six out of 10 independent voters say that his temperature is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
The Republican voters are accustomed to this idea.
When they put on their hats, the Republican voters think Trump is serious.
On the question of which was the most likely winner in the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said that Trump was a favorite, according to the CNN/ORC survey last week.
It's not like four out of 10 were put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: The GOP voters had previously not had the right magic crystal.
At the same time, in the past cycle, four out of 10 Republicans selected Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent supported possible candidate Mitta Romney.
However, this shows that many GOP voters consider the Trump campaign to be convincing.
Even if the Republicans were to split around another candidate, the Trump was still ahead of everyone else.
Some hints indicate that this distribution is likely to be of the advantage of the Trump, while non-Tramps are equally distributed to more than ten other candidates.
But a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in the hypothetical competition "one per one" between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is almost always supported by the majority.
He runs Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeba Bush at 19 points, and finally Randa Paula, John Cassich and Chris Christi at 33 points.
He's got nothing to do with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who's around him?
Ben Carson beat the businessmen at 19 points in the hypothetical competition "one by one".
There's more than half of Donald Trump's supporters saying they've changed their mind.
A new CBS/NYT survey conducted on Tuesday shows that only more than half of the Tromp-supported voters say they are confident in their votes.
Clearly, there is much that can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
46 per cent say they leave the door open to other candidates.
However, the most intense competition in Trump at the moment is with a colleague-outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've changed their mind will probably choose Trump.
Six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called immigrants from Mexico "violents" in his speech opening the campaign, the topic of immigration became the most relevant topic in the 2016 talks.
Some are concerned that Trampa will turn the key voters of Latin American origin from the Republican party and prevent rebranding.
But according to the ABC/Post survey held on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans said they agreed with Trump on immigration.
Therefore, until immigration attracts general attention, Donald Trump seems to remain in the same position.
Disillusionment by the Government is taking on new developments.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now looking to support approximately half of the Republican voters, mainly because of their foreign status.
Six of the 10 Republicans said on Monday that they wanted a political outsider rather than a man with experience in the Government.
And they're also injured in Washington.
The survey of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa, held two weeks ago, shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa were disappointed by the activities of the Republicans in Congress, with 54 per cent being “unsatisfied”, and 21 per cent being “in anger”.
The Government will decide on the fate of the pension indexes in October.
RF Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodotz stated that the Government is now looking for options to implement the Pension Indexing Act in 2016 at a real level of inflation, the GG reports.
She noted that the decision should be found by 8 October at the time of the submission of the draft budget for the following year to the Government.
In addition, the Cabin discussed the option of extending the decision to freeze Russian cumulative pensions.
The hungry noted that the pension fund amounted to 350 billion rubles.
The total pension index for the following year is approximately the same.
According to the vice-premier, there is not a final solution to the question of who should pay contributions for non-working citizens.
The hunger striker believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong to social unprotected categories of citizens, it is not entirely fair that society will pay for him.
The media had previously reported that the cab had two options to balance the budget.
Why are they often upset and reddish for centuries?
Dr. Ophthalmologist Tatian Levasov answers:
Our ages are broad, protecting eyeballs from the many small particles that are sitting on them.
Forgetting the regular cleansing of the centuries, we often contribute to the development of bluff.
Simple output:
Not three eyes with dirty hands, wearing a special wet hat for centuries;
At least 1-2 times a day clean the end of the century from those stored in them for the day of harmful substances.
The cleaning procedures should not be allowed to be complemented by warm compressions with healing grass openings (salpheases, romanches) that exacerbate the dense secret of salty iron and then by the massation of the ends of the ages that should be carried out by round movements of fingertips;
Don't use alcohol.
They dry and dissipate the skin and further enhance the secret of salt iron.
The Pyrenees claim that the Korean nuclearists have created an atomic warhead.
The North Korean authorities reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country, the nuclear complex in Yonbene, is "full power".
This was reported on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency of the country.
It is noted that at any time, the DRC is ready to respond to "US aggression and nuclear threat", as well as that the country has improved its nuclear weapons " both by quantity and by quality".
The latest nuclear test by the North Korean authorities was carried out in 2013.
However, plans have not since been made for the full resumption of the reactor.
Phenjan claims that he was able to create an atomic warhead.
The CDR has also tested the medium- and small-range missile repeatedly, writes polit.ru.
Girinovski needed to remove the mention of the brothers from the Russian Gymnamna.
Leader LDPR Vladimir Girinovski believes that the reference to the unity of the brothers should be removed from the national gym.
He said that during the Gosdom meeting, he reported on "Russian News Service".
Who are these peoples now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long gymnast, the longest in the world, even sportsmen don't survive," said Girinovski.
The honourable Member believes that all four of the following items should be removed:
In the summer of 2014, Girinovski stated that the current gym needs to be changed to "God, King of Food", and the Russian tricolor to replace the Imperial flag, writes polit.ru.
Assad urged all the forces to join in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar Assad urged all forces to join in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe wants to deal with the problem of refugees, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The issue is not that Europe is accepting or not accepting refugees, but that it is necessary to address the root causes of this problem.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
It is our opinion on this issue.
"In this regard, refugees," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in the name of consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are not possible until people die as long as the bloodshed continues and people do not feel fully secure.
"So we can reach consensus, but we can't achieve anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria," Assad stressed.
Remember, some 500 thousand migrants arrived in the countries of the European Union, including Syria.
The European Commission has stated that the current world migration crisis is the largest since World War II.
It is not excluded that thousands of militants from the Islamic State might be among the immigrants in Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia may take advantage of the situation with a view to creating their own cells in the EU for the conduct of terrorist activities.
The residents of the German city set up a holiday for refugees.
In the last month, Germany had become a leader in the reception of refugees, although it had recently strengthened border control to hold them back.
According to the authorities, some 800 thousand migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts call it a very large number.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
The correspondent, Jenny Hill, was in Darmstadt City, whose inhabitants provide migrants with a very warm reception.
Jeremy Corbin debutes in the session of the Prime Minister
Following the election of Mr. Corbin, his debut at the session of the Prime Minister's questions was expected with great impatience
The new leader of the Laborist Party, Jeremy Corbin, will soon take the Prime Minister's questions to the session, for the first time acting with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will address the first of the six issues referred to in the second half of the day; his statement will probably be closely monitored by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" on a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that he could miss some meetings by leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test by Mr. Corbin as the leader; it will take place after his appointment of a thin cabinet and his speech at the annual Congress of Trade Unions on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the decision of the leader of the Laborists to stand silent during the national gym on Tuesday, during the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain was criticised by a number of conservative members of Parliament and became the subject of several excellent articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbina ' s decision not to sing the State Gymnasium drew attention
Mr. Corbin's Press Secretary said that he was "standin' in honour" and acknowledged "Kingdom's heroism in Battle for Britain".
However, a member of Mr. Corbin Owen Smith's office reported Newsnight to BBC 2 that he would advise the leader of the Laborists to sing the national anthem "independent" from his belief that the monarchy was needed to be abolished.
Almost a dozen dark ministers refused to play with Mr. Corbin's team, sounding disagreements on economic, defence and international policies, while at least one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
Political correspondent BBC Robin Brandt said that political differences were also "copied by a stop" in the Laborist party after Mr. Corbin was appointed to the European Union office and the Government limited compensation payments.
Mr. Corbin said at the Trade Union Conference that the Labour Party had amended to eliminate the very idea of restrictions in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the Minister of Labour and Pensions, said that there was “full clarity” in the party, because it was opposed only to Government plans to reduce the ceiling from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbin will become the fifth leader of the Laborists, whom David Cameron will meet at the "Course Box" in the last ten years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Laborist, who promised a different approach to politics, stated that he had “earned collective resources” in order to raise the ideas of Mr. Cameron and received over 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from the Islandton North District said that the Prime Minister's issues were causing excessive confrontation, and that he would refrain from audacious responses and the exchange of quantities, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and problems facing young people.
Mr. Corbin said that Angela Igle, the Minister of Economic Affairs in the TEN, would replace him with the Prime Minister when he was not present, for example when Mr. Cameron was on the border.
He also sounded the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor if possible, saying that he was addressing the speaker of the House of Commons, John Berkou, to discuss the matter.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to leave the political style of the "Yormarian bag", often associated with the Prime Minister's procedure, but admitted that he had failed several years later.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister's questions have been a key indicator of the leadership's views, their ability to manage the House of Commons and the reputation of other Members of Parliament, although critics claim that this has become a cartoon and requires major reforms.
"Snaked in Yoburg" homeless young people who have taken pictures
Johannesburg Business Centre is a difficult place for homeless people.
But a group of former homeless people found a way to win the trade and make a living.
"I was taken to Yoburg" is a non-commercial studio that teaches homeless young people to take pictures of circles and work on it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound sterling grows as wages grow in Britain
The FTSE 100 index was raised by the offer of SABMiller.
From May to June, British earnings, excluding bonuses, increased by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate has been as high as possible since 2009, and it has been seen as a transfer to the earlier forecast for the possible growth of quotas.
Pound sterlings increased by more than 1 per cent against the dollar and amounted to $1,5505 and 0.84 per cent against the euro, amounting to €1,3730.
FTSE 100 grew to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
In general, the shares of SABMiller, which grew by 20 per cent, were allocated through the purchase proposal from the AB InBev competitor.
The deal would unite two world-renowned brewing companies, collecting brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
The Burberry shares grew by 0.9% in the light of encouraging news from the competing Lux Richemont product group.
The latest data on Richemont sales exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China - in the key market for Burberry - began to grow again.
The shares of Glencore increased by 5 per cent after the mining giant stated that it was able to receive $2.5 billion by placement of shares, which was done under the debt reduction strategy.
Mondi's paper production and packaging group shares were in the index, at 4.3 per cent, after Goldman Sachs reduced the group's rating to "sale".
JD Sports shares grew after a sports clothing supplier company reported a 83 per cent increase in tax for half-yearly up to £46.6 million.
Chief JD Sports says that higher wages can prevent exposure
Executive Director JD Sports Peter Caugill says that the increase in the minimum wage for British workers means "more purchasing capacity in the pockets of potential consumers".
But it is unlikely that such purchasing capacity will outweigh the cost of labour, he says.
Costs could affect JD Sports expansion plans, he added, which could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash launches a low-pressure campaign to combat Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the pressure of Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.
The leading supplier of food at the bottom launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA Riddlers in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the forthcoming impact of Aldi $700 million.
While Aldi is preparing to open two optical warehouses and the first 120 shops in South and West Australia in the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and promote IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social media and Adelaide Show activities.
Riddlers and IGA suppliers, such as the manufacturer of frozen Simmo's from Dansboro, who offers tasting in IGA stores, and store owners selling discounted tickets to the South Australian Football League.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its strategy of protection on 29 September, the day that this supplyer of food, spirit drinks and economic goods will carry out his annual investment strategy.
There was a lot going on, because in South Australia and Western Australia, IGA markets account for almost 30% of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the Eastern States.
Buyers in South and West Australia are known as regular routes, so the market here is more favourable to IGA riders than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in the US and 24 per cent in WA than in some 14 per cent in the Eastern States.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will abolish 5 per cent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of its first shops, taking the volume of sales to all the players present, but mainly to independent riders.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, analyst Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA Riddlers can lose $300 million a year in sales and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA, with sales of $500 million and 600 million in these markets respectively.
The loss of profits and sales of food at the high level of the constant cost of Metcash may cost companies around 13 million dollars prior to payment of interest and taxes, Mr. Kirat said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the Eastern States, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and this is because the recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA had the most loyal buyers.
In Morgan Stanley, sales of Metcash's food are expected to fall by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, reducing the company's market share from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, the head fund manager Hamish Douglas, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, observed in Melbourne that Metcash could disappear for decades.
Metcash refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas' comments.
But a member of the board of directors of Metcash was expected to contact Mr. Douglas last week.
The share of IGA on the market decreased from 18 to 14 per cent from 2010 and Metcash's revenues from the food business, which the company supplies to some 1200 IGA Riddlers, dropped by 43 per cent from 2012 as a result of the operation development and due to sales and profitability pressure.
However, the company does not give up more than $150 million a year in order to compare prices differentials with prices in Coles and Woolworths in thousands of positions each week and to assist IGA Riddlers in refurbishing trading venues, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider choice of food.
Director-General Metcash Yen Morris said that the comparison of prices and refurbishment of trading venues was taking place and hoped that the company would increase net income in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakis supports President Tennis Australia Steve Hilli
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves a start, not a criticism of his behavior.
Tanasi Kokkinakis has suffered in a recent scandal with his friend Nick Kiryos, and he deserves to be treated more than critics, as President Dennis Australia Steve Hilli said.
Kokkinakis, the youngest in a talented duet and often called "Special Ks", was reluctantly turned to the centre due to the shameful blow of Kiryos with Stan Vavrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Soon thereafter, during a hot qualifying match in Cincinnati, the judge had to understand Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, while Harrison said, "The warline had to be put on Kiryos's shovels, and I had to put on that guy's shovels."
C while Kokkinakis last saw a cracking rocket after the shipman in his leg rescued Risha Gaske from a possible defeat at the US Open, Hilly loyally protects Kokkinakis.
The youth is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grott for the right to be the second after Bernard Tomich in a single level in the Kubka Davis semifinal against the United Kingdom.
"I'm very concerned about one thing, namely that Tanasi got caught up in the conflict," said Hilly.
He actually broke a rocket when he had his foot on the US Open, but he wasn't the first player to break the missile when the hopes were gone, and I know Tanasi pretty well enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he's been very good in a rather provocative situation in the US, with Harrison, etc., and I'm sure he deserves confidence.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a beautiful family, and I just think he's been a little dishonest.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works a lot, he's very good at the team, he's never had any problems with other players, he's respected outside the court, he's intensively trained, he's in excellent shape, he's a very focused and developed young man, and I think he should be valued in dignity.
Hilli also supported the decision to forgive Kiryos for an important match starting on Friday, assuming that "joint agreement" was the right outcome for all, but expecting that the guy from Canberra would return to the team as a long-term game.
"First of all, we want the team to focus fully on the match, not on the quarrels around [Cyrus]," said Hilly.
And I think Nick got the power very quickly to prove that people like Feder and Marrey, he's growing up in the audience, he's making some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions, and I think it's necessary to get him out of the center for a while so he can think about them, and that's best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary announces an emergency, closes the border, detains migrants
With the announcement of an emergency, Hungary closed the border with Serbia on Tuesday to the southern border and detained those who were trying to penetrate the country illegally in order to keep the migrants in the flow.
Hundreds of migrants were buried on the border border, with a severe negative response from the Serbian authorities.
Having stopped for an indefinite period on the road between the checkpoints of two countries, people fleeing from armed violence to their families broke down their tents and were based on that location.
However, dissatisfaction grew.
When they were surrounded by a police helicopter, migrants shouted, "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian police for a special assignment.
Some in protest refused food and water.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Serbia announced an "inadmissible" expulsion of migrants back from Hungary when they were increasingly arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be a part of the problem, not a side effect.
It is necessary to hold negotiations with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The Hungarian-Serbian border flows began the next day after a group of 28 countries had been unable to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to share the common responsibility of 40,000 people seeking asylum in the overcrowded countries of Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that a further 120,000 refugees from Hungary, including refugees, will be reached in the future (in the month or at the end of the year).
The Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel and Austria, on Tuesday, requested the meeting of the Euro-Union Extraordinary Summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis that covered the continent.
Hungary, however, does not look forward to early action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency announced on Tuesday in the two southern regions gave the authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to cross the road and speed up the trial of asylum.
Meanwhile, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Seyarto, said that his country was also planning to raise a strike from the knee line at the border with Romania to cover the flows of migrants across the country, now that it had completed a strike on the Serbian border.
Correspondent CBS News Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners had been engaged in urgent work to complete the rolling gap between Hungary and Serbia.
In the last few months, Hungary has become the main “closest place” and the cross-border point of the European Union for displaced persons, many of whom are refugees of war in Syria and in the Middle East.
However, the Prime Minister of the country, Viktor Orban, insists that the majority of people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a better life rather than refugees who are victims of war who have the right to protection, and this view is strongly divided with the views of other EU countries, i.e. Germany.
The new laws in force in Hungary are now considered to be a crime of crossing or damaging a 4-metre (13-foot) roll-over, built by the Government along the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison terms for the accused of trafficking in persons.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government is declaring an emergency," Zoltan Kovac, a representative of the government in the southern city of Seged, told reporters.
We clearly understand that illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
The formal parliament still has to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but the reporters of the Associated Press who are on the border have already observed the presence of armed front teeth with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Deerd Bakondi, the National Security Adviser of Orban, reported on the appointment of 45 persons authorized to cross the border at the border, and 15 others within the country.
They crossed the border by breaking the fence and are currently under police custody and are accused of administrative violations under new laws.
The authorities are quickly restoring the damage.
On Tuesday morning, the Hungarian authorities also closed two out of seven crossings on the border with Serbia, forcing one of the crossings to be blocked by a railway wagon surrounded by a wheelchair.
The riots erupted at the main crossing of the border near the city of Ryoske (Hungary), as the Hungarians placed the office room for people to miss inside the metal container, and crowds of people forced each other to break in.
Some 20 people were able to enter, and thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway leading from Serbia to Hungary and announced that they would be denied food and water until they were missed in Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders has been reduced twice in the national survey
Former Secretary-General Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-way victory for the country's nomination of the Democrats, but Senator Bernie Sanders is pursuing it.
Clinton now supports 47 per cent of the primary democratic voters (down from 58 per cent) and Sanders is the second 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Baiden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential race, receives 15 per cent of the primary democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the competition in the primary elections, the majority of Democratic voters said that they were talking too early about what they had identified as the candidate they would support.
The Clinton participants are more confident in their choice than any other candidate.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton has lost support for some population groups, and Sanders has earned some bonuses.
Clinton has a great advantage among women and the dead, but this advantage has been reduced.
Her support among men has fallen substantially, and Sanders is only 5 points away from her.
The preference given to Clinton as a democratic electorate for up to 50 years has disappeared, and they and Sanders are now on the same level.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage among senior voters.
Last month, Clinton beat Sanders for a double number of liberals, but Sanders now has the advantage of 5 points in this group.
Almost half of the primary democratic voters throughout the country say they would gladly support Clinton if she became a candidate for the party.
Four would support her with some reservations and 15 per cent would support her only because she was a candidate.
Six per cent would not support it.
It may not be surprising that Clinton's current supporters are likely to be more enthusiastic about her.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, the views are more controversial - only about a quarter with enthusiasm would support her.
As 48 per cent of primary democratic voters say they would be enthusiastic about supporting Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trampe (35 per cent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question, why they want to see her candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the necessary experience (16 per cent), then that she is now a female president (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for this position (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters are also talking about an association linking it to Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
There is also agreement on issues and the possibility of election.
Since the Vice-President is considering potential election participation, 57 per cent of the primary democratic voters would like him to join the race, although the third considers he should not.
When asked who they wanted to see in the second place among the candidates from the party, the primary democratic voters in most cases called Baiden.
In the middle of Clinton's supporters, they say they'd choose Byden the second, that's more than Sanders.
If Baiden decides not to present his candidacy from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Baiden among the racers to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five per cent of Democratic voters saw a candidate in Clinton with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that figure dropped from 78 per cent last month.
Byyden has a high drop in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him to be the most likely candidate has increased.
However, in response to the question that is most important in the candidate, democratic voters choose options other than the opportunity to be elected.
Similar to the situation last month, none of the candidates from Democrats or potential candidates is an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have shown good results in some of the key characteristics of primary voters from their party.
The majority consider Clinton, Sanders and Baiden to be honest and trustworthy people with good leadership.
Byden of all three leads in honesty, and the strong side of Clinton in her leadership.
Thirty per cent of primary democratic voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and trustworthy, twice as much as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have a certain opinion on this matter.
The primary democratic voters are also generally considered to be similar to the ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Byden.
According to all these measures, about four democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
While questions relating to the personal e-mail box and the server at Hillary Clinton continue to be addressed as her Secretary-General, most primary democratic voters are satisfied with this explanation and believe that this did not have a negative impact on their overall view of it.
But it's a completely different story for the American public in general.
Half of Americans today are not satisfied with her explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
The public’s views on this were divided in March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say that the debate on e-mail had no effect on their overall opinion on Clinton, although 36 per cent said that their opinion on it had deteriorated.
They're mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10 people who claim that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is considered to be an honest and credible voter from her party, it continues to be a problem for her among registered voters in general: only 32 per cent are considered to be honest and trustworthy, eight points below last month, and 15 compared to May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it honest and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters throughout the country do not consider the Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump both, however, get good grades on leadership.
Of the six protested candidates Byden, Carson and Bush show the best results in honesty.
Most people see Sanders more honest than they do, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error margin for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
As a result of the national survey, Ben Carson approached Donald Trampu in a strong way.
Ben Carson joined Donald Tramp in the latest CBS/New York Times survey
The two candidates took half the vote in the new poll, leaving all the others in search of support under their feet.
Democratic voters throughout the country continue to support Trump, whose support rate has increased from 23 per cent in the recent CBS poll conducted prior to the Fox News debate last month, to 27 per cent in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson flew for the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also showed that Carson benefited from the support of all population groups by pushing the Trump into a group of Republican voters with higher education.
The other candidates, with the exception of Carli Fiorina and Governor Ogayo Jon Kasic, were back with Governor Wisconsin Scott Walker, whose support dropped from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jab Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Hakabi, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, have held third place together with 6 per cent.
The error margin for the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey is plus minus 6 per cent, and the survey took place in September.
The recent CNN/ORC survey, published last week, showed the growth of Carson in the surveys, demonstrating 19 per cent of the Republic's support for Trump with 32 per cent of its support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed that the Trump is significantly overrun by Carson.
Because of the increase in Carson's support last week, Trump made several critical incidents to the former neurosurgery, even when Carson apologized for questioning the faith of Tramp.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday when the campaign was closed in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are accused of the death of Baruch's first-class college
About two years after the death of a college student during the ceremony in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, the charge of murder was filed against five people.
"Members of Pi Delta Psi from Baruch College attacked Chan Michael Deng in September 2013 and did not deliver him to the hospital on time, which led to his death," they reported to the police.
Officials say that students with eyes tied up and 30-pound backpacked with sand behind their back several times as they tried to reach their goals by walking on the side of the surface.
Mr. Deng finally complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
The P Delta Psi brothers didn't call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and they were waiting for another supposed hour before they got him to the hospital, they were talking to the police.
However, they found time to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in Google, and contact Andy Meng, the National Brotherhood President, to ask for advice, as told by the police chief Chris Wagner at the press conference.
"At this point, the members of the brotherhood began to hide personal property, in substance, by putting the welfare of the brotherhood above Michael Deng," said Chief Wagner.
I couldn't save him, and he ended up the next morning.
According to the report of the discovery, Deng received a few stupid headaches, hives, and pillows.
“Very many families have suffered as a result of rituals of fraternity, as at least one student dies every year, starting in 1970,” said Douglas Fireberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
Brothers and their members must bear responsibility, and this step by the authorities is very important.
Monroe's jury has turned to the third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, will be charged with violence against a new and criminal dispute.
“We want to bring not only individual participants into responsibility, but if there is an organization that has authorized all of this to be officially or informally, so is it,” Wagner said at the press conference on Tuesday.
College Baruch banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood excluded the local office from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
Increased rates will occur, and the "big market" will occur, bond revenues will increase, and the economy will fall into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it's going to take before it comes, and how long it's going to continue.
Especially for the economy, history has little to do with time.
The recession took place only 11 months after the first increase in rates and for a total of 86 months.
The stiffness of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, although not always, determines the response of the economy and financial assets.
Therefore, the U.S. Central Bank Administration is so insistent that investors should not focus on when it will start raising rates and on how much adaptation will be required.
In fact, in many different games.
In the end, however, market participants may find that the entire rate increase around them is exaggerated.
"The first increase in the Federal Reserve with a global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the end of the money age," said Julian Jessop, the chief expert on the international economy in Capital Economics, in his commentary to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of interest rates to the United States to be more normal, but still low levels will be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Consider how some areas of the economy could respond to historical trends:
As you have seen in the market in the last month or about, the expectation of higher rates may lead to instability for some time.
When the rate is increased, however, the consequences are usually not such dramatic.
"It is not possible for stock revenues to slow down for 12-24 months after the first jump, which, again, probably reflects a delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of the Federal Reserve.
If, in particular, the market for the last about 35 years is more rapidly changing - about 14 per cent - to increase rates, it remains sufficiently stable for 250 days (average growth 2.6 per cent), then, after the expiration of 500 days, returns to a normal rate of average income of 14.4 per cent for the last six cycles, according to Bob Doll's recent analysis, the chief action strategy specialist in Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
In Deutsche it is said that the result for securities is not a tendency to become more pronounced immediately at the rate increase stage, and stock revenues are beginning to decline.
Reactions are a fact of economic life, but higher rates often contribute.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed in conditions that have not existed before and may accelerate the recession.
In general, the gross domestic product will be at almost its lowest point at all times of the higher rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases, the increase in rates since 1950 was only twice the nominal annual GDP of less than 4.5 per cent.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 per cent, few people believe it is long, while in the third quarter it is only 1.5 per cent, according to Atlanta Fed.
The increase in rates on such a unstable economic background may be risky and asks whether there will be a second time," Deutsche reported.
Market participants are prepared to increase the Federal Reserve System's rates throughout the year, with their views attached to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategic and economic experts believe that FOMC could approve the increase in rates at this meeting, future trade is only a 25 per cent probability.
“In our study since 1950, all the higher rates to date have been in the supercycle of an increasing financial gap with GDP, covering peaks before recession, very quickly after recovery,” the report says.
In contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the chosen period.
The current cycle to date is the longest that the Federal Reserve System has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record has been 35 months, it has only lasted 74 months and has not yet been completed.
The fixed income has also become unstable while the market is expected to increase rates, and this scenario is in some ways similar to the one that is being implemented for shares.
The basic difference is that the effect on bonds will be faster than on shares when the Federal System changes its strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it appears that income changes the vector immediately after the first increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the increase in interest rates, the bond income falls immediately," Deutsche reports.
Strategy specialists from Charles Schwab believe that rising rates will bring long-term and short-term bonds income levels closer together, making the curve more flat.
High-income bonds are often better in such a climate, although "we are still afraid of fluctuations in income," says a study by Katy Jones, a fixed income analysis in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of the federal system ' s policies.
“In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and the falling of inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has been built on a more robust monetary policy perspective”, she wrote.
The interest rates on short-term loans were raised, income growth increased, credit advances increased, volatility increased - all market characteristics increased by the Federal System ' s policy.
In general, companies that run their main business in the United States win from increasing interest rates and local production will become more attractive.
International debt companies will become worse because the rising dollar makes their products cheaper in the world market space and their debt cheaper in the financial sector.
"History shows that "quality" shares demonstrate market efficiency over three months after the initial increase in rates," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a customer report.
Companies with a stable financial status have gone to companies with a unstable status as a result of each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004, on an average of 5 percentage points.
High-income companies, as well as low-voltility shares, have also shown better efficiency than low-quality shares, on average, 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
The debt will be a big question.
Companies with a high rate of debt with a floating rate lose most, says Goldman.
In addition to purely stock exchanges, consumers will benefit from the rising dollar.
Investigators could also see income through higher income, although experts were spending on how fast this would take place.
"BBC Radio 3 - Copy Classic FM," - approves a member of Parliament from Conservative Andrew Bingham
A member of Parliament of Conservatives Andrew Bingham criticised the station for "lowering standards"
Proves that it is becoming less and less different from a commercial competitor
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that the prize is just dealt with by the British
College on Parliament Damien Collins, who was attacked by The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 is becoming a Classic FM," said Parliament's leader, encouraging the radio company to prove that it does anything that commercial companies do not do.
A member of parliament from conservatives Andrew Bingham also told the BBC leadership, which seems to be the public radio station "stupid" and is becoming less and less distinct from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like using the word "simplification" - but it seems to turn into a Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards prize launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits.
So if you're trying to do something else, here's two examples that first came to my mind, in which you're actually just copying what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General of BBC rejected the charge by claiming that BBC Radio 3 was moving far ahead of his commercial rival when it came to live music and auditory education.
What I know about Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anywhere else.
And his devotion to live speech and the creation of music will not really compare with anyone else.
"It is also very important, I think, that Radio 3 is interested in finding new music and in promoting new productions," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Manager Radio 3 Alan Davy claimed that radio stations had to work a lot more to attract audiences than in the past, because the British were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child of BBC who was attacked by five commercial competitors during the hearings of the Ad Hoc Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
A member of the Parliament of Tori Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a musical show of talents that BBC bought at the Dutch Talpa Media at a cost of 22 million pounds.
See why this programme is often discussed in connection with the lack of originality and distinctions?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, in which Paloma Feit and Boy George participate as judges, was done in a typical BBC style.
He added what he wanted from the Corporation to "find a hit in his own home horse" next time she started a fun project.
However, it does not consider it necessary to prevent the creation of new The Voice seasons in the future or the use of the money of those paying the licence fee to other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales growth has slowed most in August, and may therefore be Black Friday.
The first three months of 2015 saw an increase in online sales by seven per cent
Last month, the slowest growth has been observed since it began to be observed in 2000.
Online sales increased three years ago using mobile shopping devices
Experts are convinced that November Black Friday could contribute to the cost reduction
For about ten years, virtual shopping has been booming, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost cities.
But experts say that there have now been signs of online sales balance, after the latest data showed only a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total online shopping costs in August have shown minimal growth since they began to be fixed in 2000, with only a five per cent increase.
Experts say that there have now been signs of online sales balance, after the latest data showed only a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the growth rate in previous years and come back to 2000, they have always found a reasonable explanation," said Guardian Andy Malkehi, editor of the IMRG Sales Index.
He explained that online sales had intensified three years ago when buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people had the opportunity to buy online, and that they could do so under any circumstances, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it goes to the plate, and you can see a decrease (growth).
The phenomenon of Black Friday, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the delay in sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying prior to the event that took place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, buyers made a five-fold increase in the average speed of computers to benefit from offers, thus interrupting a number of vendors ' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers enter the present fight for profitable purchases, could keep people from shopping
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, over 1 pound of sterling per 5 is spent online.
With regard to goods such as televisions and stereos, more than one third of them are sold through the Internet store.
At the same time, more than four people buy clothes and shoes online more readily than in fashion stores in central streets.
Muslims protect those killed when the crane falls in Mecca, and Ben Laden's family is subject to sanctions.
Muslims carry 29 dead bodies on the streets, as the first funerals begin in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the accident
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 persons were also traumatized after the collapse of the crane
Hundreds of Muslims came all over the street to bury 29 of the victims who were killed as a result of the collapse of the crane on the main mosque of Mecca.
The majority of the white people present in the funerals have half-painted the passage to pay tribute to the first of the dead who have gone on their last way to the Al-Moaism cemetery.
The seal process went beyond the sacred place, where just a few days earlier, the building crane broke through the cover of the mosque and fell on its proponents.
The bodies were issued for burial, and at the same time, the King of Saudis punished a construction company belonging to the Ben Laden family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 persons who died in the head of the Main Mosque were carried on the streets
Among the dead were the father of the four children, Cassim Akram from Bolton, the Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage to the palace when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Main Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual hajj.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the haj in Mecca will continue, as thousands of people are still arriving in the city.
Today, King Solomon said that Binladin Group should not have left the crane shot with an unworked crane.
The Arab version of the decree issued by the State agency Saudi Press states that Binladin Group is partly responsible for the violation.
The English editorial of the news agency did not mention this detail, but reported that the company's leaders had been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Solomon promised to identify the cause of the cranial collapse in the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims arrived to go to the haj in this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements regarding the collapse of the crane and its representatives were not available for comments.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and of improper harmonization of action with the meteorological service.
Tens of cranes are surrounded by the Main Mosque of Mecca, as part of the extensive construction work conducted by Binladin Group.
For decades, the Ben Laden family has been among the approaching family of Saudi Arabia and has managed major construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaida Usama Ben Laden was a son-in-law, whose family was denied in the 1990s.
Avariya happened in strong winds and rain only a few days before millions of people came to the kingdom to participate in the palace, which is mandatory at least once in life for every hardworking Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 people remained in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay a million dollars (about $174 000) to relatives of the deceased, and the same amount was irrevocable.
The other victims will receive half of that amount.
Chapter B&Q argues that the trend is due to the presence of small-scale European masters
According to Veronica Lori, the British are increasingly hiring repair specialists.
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is increasing
Results - opening more than 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores all over the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, city correspondent Daily Mail
They say that the British are putting milk and malaise on the side and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to carry out domestic work.
If you are able to deal with a mole or paint a wall, you seem to be in a minority in our day.
Because, according to the owner of B&Q, the British are increasingly hiring specialists to carry out uncomplicated work at home.
Veronica Lori, the new Director-General of Kingfisher, who owns the home-building services network, reported that this trend is accompanied by a significant flow of skilled Eastern European teachers offering minimum-price services.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in goods for masters, while closing 60 B&Q stores.
Ms. Lori said that she wanted to see more women in B&Q shop staff, since eight out of ten procurement decisions in the store were taken by representatives of the weak sex.
Most of the staff are men at present.
She said that there was no indication of the recent demographic trends characterized by the increase in the number of single women ' s households who were more involved in housing than in the past.
Mrs. Lori said, "In our stores, men still work mostly.
Steps must be taken to achieve the balance.
In general, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on the goods purchased are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Lori, one of five women in the role of leading British companies, whose shares are taken into account in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the team of top managers from among directors of an equal number of men and women.
Kingfisher is the only company in which 50 per cent of managers are women, including the Director-General and Finance.
Ms. Lori said, "It was a conscious decision, diversification, an important issue for us.
It was not difficult to find suitable women in the Board of Directors.
After the group had incurred the costs of closing shops, Kingfisher had shown a decrease in revenues and sales in half.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q, opens 200 new shops
Time of decision on the Federal Reserve interest rate
The world observed a meeting held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which discussed the decision to raise or not the interest rate for the first time in the last decade over two days.
A survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would do so last week now believe that it would still be temporary and maintained at the current level of 0-0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time, we approach the fact that the main bank may move from a zero point of view and begin the process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubida, head of the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
The U.S. economy works effectively, economic recovery adds trillion dollars to the balance sheet and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision affects the world economy.
He warned the markets that they should be prepared for change, but they were all about their confidence that all the odds against such a move would be met.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
A new Balkan route: refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
"Open!" -- hundreds of refugees are scanning at the Horgosh checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
On Tuesday Budapest crossed the border for the displaced.
The asylum seekers are already beginning to pass on other routes to the European Union.
One of them is in the vicinity of the closed border with Serbia across Romania.
Another is Croatia and Slovenia in Austria.
According to some data, buses that have taken refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the city of Shidah on the Croatian border.
Leaders have been ordered by the authorities to follow without stopping.
The Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stepaniovic assures that his country is doing everything in its power to help refugees, but its opportunities are limited:
Our work is to ensure Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to have a human attitude toward them.
But it's already a pan-European problem.
It is not easy to deal with, no country in Europe alone will be able to do so, and a smaller country such as Serbia will not be able to do so.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not wish to remain in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is unhindered:
If a person is called a refugee, he must fill in the necessary documents in Serbia.
And if he doesn't, he won't leave it in our country, because Serbia is safe.
Hungary has already conducted a 175-kilometer strike on the border with Serbia.
But the Orban is not going to stop: it plans to bring the same settlement on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Mayrakis: "Europe wants to help us."
Vangelis Maymarakis has been in the right-wing governments for several years, which, in the opinion of the left, have led the country to a financial crisis.
Now he has become a temporary leader of the New Democracy Party, challenges Cyprus.
A few days before his election, he met with a journalist named Evronus.
Evronus: Mr. Mayrakis, welcome to Evronus!
Vangelis Mayrakis: Thank you for your invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat by joining the SIRIZA coalition, but now, according to the polls, "New Democracy" was compared to it in popularity.
What's changed during this time?
Vangelis Mayrakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Cyprus lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget profit and prospects for economic growth.
The country now again has a budget deficit and a high level of unemployment.
The investors left because Mr. Cyprus chased them.
In the last nine months, the Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises of Mr. Cyprus.
And now they can easily compare what they promised with what actually happened.
Daily life has become much worse than January when the situation improved, with most Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you say that if you win the election, you will try to join other parties, including SIRIZ.
Vangelis Maymarakis: The case is that, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is not a coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in place, political forces and all the ruling parties have gathered together to implement the programme on which they have agreed, without giving up their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in support of the agreement between Mr. Cyprus and the country ' s creditors.
If you become a new prime minister on Monday, will you comply with this agreement, or will you try to change it at least in part?
Vangelis Maymarakis: In fact, we voted in favour of Greece's movement on the European road, because we are well aware of the devastating consequences that would result from the country's departure from the EU.
Now Europe is helping us by granting subsidies to our farmers for their production, we have solidarity funds, the Unioner package and assistance in the banking sector.
All of this would have been lost had there not been a treaty with Europe.
But the current harsh economic measures were the result of Mr. Cyprus's negotiation.
I know Europe doesn't want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek Government wants to order during the first year, operates rationally and realizes that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am sure that all commitments that cannot be fulfilled due to the recession can be negotiated again but only after a certain time.
It would be a mistake to believe that we can return to negotiations with our creditors in the first year of the new agreement, as they expect full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to regain their confidence, we must continue to privatize, reform and structural changes that have been agreed upon, and continue to benefit from EU funding and the greater investment opportunities that we need to open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Government of Cyprus did not present any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we have identified by discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example of farmers' income.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the Cyprus ministers had never talked about it.
In other words, the Greek ministers were not prepared and were misinformed, so they failed to negotiate and concluded a failed agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be at one table with Mr. Juncker, Mr. Holland, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them be different from what your predecessor Antonis Samaras told them?
Vangelis Maymarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014, we have tried best to implement the 2012 agreement with its sharp corners.
We have made progress on reform.
Of course, we did not have the necessary determination and speed, but we were in an emergency.
The market fell, and potential buyers were not seen to be willing to pay the price of the Greek Government.
At the time, I was the speaker of Parliament, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups, which were then the majority of the Government.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working parliament, which was in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations abroad.
And we managed to bring the country into a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the early universal elections resulting from the December presidential elections.
Euronews: The mass flow of refugees has flown over Greece in recent weeks.
What do you think about this situation and the reactions of the European countries that these people are seeking?
Vangelis Maymarakis: The refugee crisis is a slow-down bomb with which we have to deal after the election.
And the reason is that the Government of SIRIZA did not act in this situation as it did.
In such cases, action should be taken, for if you have a problem, only emergency measures remain.
And we're in this situation right now.
Even the temporary Government that replaced SIRIZ had done more in seven days than Mr. Cyprus did in seven months.
I am confident that these actions of the temporary Government, which is providing valuable assistance to the President of the Republic, who called for the EU summit, will enable us to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and find refugees who are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some of the extraordinary events that have happened to them.
There is a deep humanitarian dimension in this issue, and we will hold on to the position that European policies must adopt in this new situation.
The relevant decision should be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination of action, more effective border control and refugee reception centres.
We also need to make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to deal with this pressing problem.
Mr. Mayrakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Mayrakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful town of Drujkovka Donecka, during the day of the criminal investigation of the Chief Military Administration of the area, a suspect was found and detained by a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the town of Krivwa Rog (Dnepropervo region), who, early in the evening during the joint use of alcoholic beverages, fired a car into his opponent in the village of Verhenetorek in the Yasinovat district of Donetchina.

A man who opened fire at Delta State University left a note with excuses
After the shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that same day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying that he was "sighs" about the first murder and would like to "return everything back", the authorities reported on Tuesday.
Police in the city of Gottie, Mississippi, report that the professor of geography and public science at the University of Delta called 911 about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he told me he shot someone.
Lamb told the dissident that the police had to send people to him at home.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there's a dog in the house that "no one is throned," but probably upset.
The police were interested in the name of the caller, but he didn't call it.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the gun.
Upon entering the scene of the crime, the police discovered the body of Amy Prentiss, 41 years old, and a note written by Lamba, 45 years old, saying, "I'm sorry I would like to return it all.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb went 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, and on Monday evening, when the police surrounded him, he ended up with him.
University Rector William Laforge reported that he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb apparently had something on his mind."
Despite the information received on Monday that Lamb suggested a novel between Prentiss and Schmidt, the official services reported on Tuesday that “no information or evidence” of the “love triangle”.
The Prentiss responded as "good man" Sean O'Stin, who reported having been married to her for about seven years.
They were divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Stin told me that he and Prentiss had a daughter of 19 and that she was "unsatisfied."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Lindsey Noulz, which San Herald calls a close friend Prentiss, the last one working from home on the Internet.
Nouls told me that Prentiss had a hunting dog on Lightning's phone and that she had met Lamb for about three years.
Nouls said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, on Monday, Lamb called his family at some point to say, "He won't go to jail."
On the same day that the police hit him on a "1" show near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself there.
According to a summary on the university website, in spring 2015 Lamb received a degree of doctoral education in the State University of Delta.
The Stars That Lose Their Success
The actor (left), in a photo with his son Redmond (right), has lived for several difficult years.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia and in 2009 he lost his multi-year lifelong companion, Farru Fosset, who died of cancer.
The actor was reported to have also suffered from drug addiction and was arrested for drug trafficking in 2008.
All of this certainly played a role.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United went out for a few months because of a double break
Luke Shaw broke his right foot in two places during the League of Champions, in which Manchester United lost the PSV in Endhoven.
While the defendant survives in this regard, which will not allow him to go out in the field for at least six months, Louis van Gal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again in this season.
Trauma took place during the senseless subpoena of Hector Moreno at the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV zone.
He was assisted in the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He has a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
They'll take him to Manchester tomorrow or the day after, and then they'll operate.
This terrible--the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcome great difficulties and began playing fantastically, and here it happened.
It had an oxygen mask on it.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double break, it's for six months, and the guy can't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again in this season.
Moreno's lucky he didn't get a red card and no pens were assigned.
Arbitr Nikola Riccoly didn't punish a Mexican.
Van Gal thinks the Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge yourself, when I say it's worth a pen and a red card.
It was a very bad basement with two legs.
In his tweet, Shaw writes, "Thank you all for your messages, not to describe how I've been abandoned, my path to recovery begins, I'll be back even stronger than I was."
More on the subject: Manchester United suffers from an accident with Luke Shaw in the game with PSV
The English defender will have an additional incentive to move to the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Koku, coach PSV, said, "This is a very serious trauma."
When any game goes through with such a trauma, it's all very upset.
That was never the intention of our players to traumatize the opponent.
Moreno moved his leg across when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team under Van Gale's leadership at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's very difficult now because he didn't intend to hurt the enemy, and when you hear that it's a very serious trauma, you feel bad," Koku said.
I couldn't see for myself.
The only thing I could see was the ball that flew in the other direction, so it looked as if he (Morino) had touched it, but I didn't see the sub under Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to carry it.
I'm very sorry, and I'm very sorry.
Andres Guardado from PSV was also taken to the hospital after meeting Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Loraks?
Every parent adopts one thing very quickly: if your child likes a book, it'll be a little while before you wake up to know her almost drunk.
Looks like you're not David Cameron.
In response to the question of the representative of the children's vacation organization in Caniculue, the Prime Minister chose the "Lorax" story of his favorite children's book, which was written by Dr. Suez in 1971.
This was a difficult choice, wrote Cameron in a comment published on the SuperCamps site, and continues: "This funny, touching, unusual story with a strong message I love to read to my children, because it always contains some image or message we miss."
And it would be all right, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to cross the contents of the book, but in fact, he is talking about a single film taken in 2012, with new characters and details added to the rather short original narrative.
"In the surrounding high walls of the city of Versažvil, where there was no green and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey--the girls of his dream, having fulfilled her wish--to see the present tree," we read in the text of a description of the love story of Dr. Suzu (now named Theodore Suez Gazel), who died in 1991.
If this is not quite suspicious, Cameron's text is read almost as a short presentation of the film "Lorax", posted on the Internet Movie Database: "In the surrounding high walls of the city of Versusville, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - the girls of his dream."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, generally recognized as an active parent, was so unfamiliar with the contents of a book that the unnamed boy knew how to destroy the environment’s greedy tree cutter and slumper Nachokins, despite the protests of Loraks (the name of the book) - a funny substance with all that “talked on behalf of trees”.
Most likely, such an uncomplicated PR assignment was commissioned by an executive who had never read a book about Loraks to his child 20 times a day.
The representative of Downing Street stated that the text was allegedly received from Cameron's office in the electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comments were followed.
For Adam Lit, there was a clear risk of not getting into England, but it was still a difficult question.
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a simple task, but if you look at the assembly that England has chosen for this tour, the rerun of the 3-0 test series, which happened last time, it seems unlikely to me.
I would also not exclude the victory in my field.
Alister Cook's team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are players who play with them, they take their ball with them, and they have a lot of collective thinking; they don't bring the scars from 2012 but only a young man's position.
With Moen Ali's ball, it turns into a bowling ball, and Adil Rashid, even if he's an unknown figure for the test level, is an offensive option.
More on the subject: Adam Lit was expelled from England by a test cricket and replaced by Alex Heilz
The decision to exclude Adam Lit from me, his principal coach in Yorkshire, is of course difficult to analyze.
His seven test matches had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the obvious but harsh reality was that the games in the cricket were judged by the judges as a result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I have already said this earlier) the games are best chosen for themselves.
The couple were half-hearted, and Lithuania could have waited for a longer career, but he was in charge of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
The chief coach of the English assembly, Trevor Bayliss, responded well to his mood, even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and that didn't surprise me; he was first a team game and then everything else.
The question is, how long will it take before the batsman of the test cricket leaves the impression that it is a difficult question.
Lit played seven games like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton was nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and on a foreign field.
The only thing you could complain about is what England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean League when Lit was in the best form, but this lost opportunity is already in the past.
It's Alex Hayles, and he's the Batman I appreciate.
He's an unpredictable cricketer that we saw at the Yorkshire Club at the beginning of this season when he won 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but it would, of course, depend on the composition of the OAU team.
The idea of placing Moen next to Cook as an opening batsman, which would allow the additional spinder to be introduced, while keeping four speed bowlers, is under consideration, and I am not against it at all.
I can't see why the drummer can't pull the ball out there, and the left has already shown that he's a damn good cricketer.
Moon may not be exactly what it takes for his county of Woostershire, but it became the third number for them, and there's no big difference here.
My old companion on Justin Langer's team played his first 38 test match "Third Batsman" before leaving as opening in 2001.
He won three hundred at once and didn't look.
Zafar Ansari comes to the stand as a reserve spinner, and with my brief companion, he showed me a very promising young man.
People can look at his sample statistics -- on average 31 with bits and 35 with a ball -- and think it's a risky rate, but among the voters who voted for a little, and the voters chose youth.
He'll learn a lot in this tour.
In addition to the collection, England plans to make a few practical supplements in the training system.
The appointment of Mahela Jayouordin, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a test match consultant, could be a master course.
He's one of the best guys for the game that will bring her the richest experience gained under all possible conditions and in any attack.
Paul Collingwood is included in the game where a white ball is used, and it will provide both energy and a no-good speed in the set.
I have always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether a game or a training job, and like Mahela, he has little intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the gap, even if they say what has already been said, may add new forces to the team.
Colleague on the part of Darema Ben Stokes left for lunch, Ruth was given a similar break with Australia, and I, for example, do not have any problems in this regard.
While not all agree, coaches and players do not determine the schedule.
And you must remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easy.
The UK exit camp can win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron's unimaginable policy to resume negotiations on the maintenance of Britain in the EU is becoming increasingly difficult every day, even without considering the choice of genius Jeremy -- "Is that right or not?" -- Corbin as a leader of the Laborists or the TUC's malnutrition about Europe Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbins and Nigel Faraji.
The friendly European diplomat explained in the days when the EU is now facing a wide range of crises - not all of them own - some countries are members of the British e-centred network, cutting through concessions and subversive agreements, which they do not want in the main.
Upon meeting in Briton for an annual meeting, the TUC decided that he would not want them at all if they destroyed social protection.
We could even call it "the self-help program of Dave and George."
The Prime Minister and Minister of Finance are crammed at the summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photographing themselves in the background of a well-known local monument, in or without local identity companies, then coming home and saying that they are attracting allies to reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who is interested in maintaining external contacts with Britain under the EU's will, "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin, suggests that the ministers and officials in some capitals come to understand when they're still there, we'll stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, a very cautious Chancellor of Germany, is an ally, but she is in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before the situation worsens, as it has worsened for the Tetcher (11 years), Mitterran (14) and Kolya (16).
France's head, François Holland, is facing a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland could soon receive the nationalist government of the right-wing crowd, Spain - the left.
It is difficult to see them coming from the skin of the van to help the self-britches whose energy could be wasted to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - which they do not want, because most of them have similar separatist trends.
So some of these ministers can even plan to release deliberately useless SNP-style diamonds during the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to boost the process of getting Britain out of the EU, my friend suggests.
"The review was an idea-fix" and "British has not received anything valuable from the renewed negotiations".
Europeans are aware of the extent to which they may be a thief in the Fleet Street and how skeptical they are about the EU, unlike the time of Tony Benn's 1975 referendum, which supported our entry in 1973 with a 2:1 ratio.
They can hardly remember Boris Johnson, the root euro-opportunist, who celebrated his "EU direct bananas" by the Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
With all his nonsense Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a cluster company with fearsome julian taxes, phone hackers and pseudo-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was quite the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a giant gorilla, you have to give her bananas to get her away and not let her eat you in a chain and tea again.
According to Milliband, Blair was more committed than Blair himself to opposing Cameron's idea of referendum, since Blair was in favour of the rejected EU constitution, which was buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who issued him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him.
But my dear Jeremy Corbin, who was the friend who caught me in the back of Westminster on Monday -- I told him he had no time to spend on me -- looks like he's risking repeating the strategy of Neal Kinnok's "boy of Merdoku" from the '80s -- a mistake and then, and now.
This may take time, but it must develop a consistent strategy of interaction with the press - not with me, but exactly with Andrew Marrom, on which he sat on the couch at the VVC on Sunday.
The official position of Corbin on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He said he would like us to remain in the reformed EU.
Indeed, the majority of people outside the traditionalistic trend of Ukip and the wider circle of “small Anglican” in the region may say “yes”.
It's the same as Hillary-Benn, but not Bennit-Benn said on the radio and TV this week, while his internal fighter was refusing to admit that the appointment of John McDonnell's Corbin as a "dark" minister of finance was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the 1970s when his father-in-law of all forces fought on TV for disloyalty to colleagues in the Laborist Cabinet, not going too far and not losing his position in the Cabinet of Ministers.
Hillary's battle was more attractive.
But the fight to remain "under any circumstances" is not what McDonnell was saying, and not what J. K. was talking to the Peruvians and Members of Parliament at a private meeting on Monday evening, in general opinion.
In order to inform the democracy and his "boy" Corbin - remember, he throned even me - the discipline of the messages remains important in the century of round-day television seven days a week, and especially in the watercourse of social networks, the horror of paranoia and betrayal.
It is reasonable not to allow Cameron to simply separate from Europe, allowing him to accept as he deserves the support of the Laborists during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But the main mistake of McDonnell and Corbin's EU membership - in the Benitian economy of siegeed fortress - is no longer the issue of an esoteric discussion among the left-wing dissidents for whom narcissism, born with a minor distinction, is the central principle in dogmatic disputes.
With regard to his mistakes regarding NATO-Tom Watson, J.K. will not hesitate to leave, foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to bring this to their leaders at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital -- they also have suspicious voters -- on British assignments when it can be pointless?
The US$ is already very disappointed by the weak military actions of British people in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Government of the Republic will cut the costs, as I was reminded on Monday during the chain at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticise the review of electronic cigarettes from Public Health England
Statements by the Government of the Agency that electronic cigarettes were 95 per cent less harmful than smoking had been reported at a meeting of 12 people, some of whom were related to the tobacco industry, as reported by the researchers.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) jointly with Lancet criticized the evidence used by the Public Health England (PHE) in their electronic cigarettes report.
PHE published an important report, "returning age" last month, calling it "the comprehensive review of evidence".
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and suggested that some experts should be contacted by the tobacco industry.
In the editorial article in Lancet's medical journal last month, the "extremely shocking argument" was criticised by PHE for building its main conclusion.
In article BMJ, two other researchers asked whether these statements were “strong or false grounds”.
Martin McCi, professor of European health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, reported: “The fundamental health principle must be based on evidence of effectiveness”.
According to them, the public expects that PHE's statements that “current best estimate shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than tobacco smoking” were based on a detailed analysis of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this is the only meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a multi-criterial model of decision-making in order to summarize their views on the harm associated with the various non-containing products; the results of the meetings are briefed in scientific publications.
McKi and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose director-general was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
It also confirmed the health certificates of BAT in the report on sustainable development.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, not to mention the funding he reportedly received from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
There was no reasonable explanation for the selection of members of the board, but there were several known supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of which also reported funding for the industry in the publication.
It is not known whether other participants have experience in tobacco management.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco manager at PHE.
The scientific article published by the group "is well agreed" that there is a lack of "significant evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria", wrote McCi and Capewell.
However, none of these links and restrictions were included in the PHE report.
McKi and Capewell said that PHE's statements that "there is currently no evidence that electronic cigarettes are expensive, bringing children or non-smokers to smoke" were premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Head of Health and Well-being at PHE, said that BMJ had already responded.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than tobacco."
One of the two smokers died from his passion.
All the evidence suggests that the health threats from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the remote consequences.
PHE has a clear responsibility to inform the public about what they prove and what they do not prove, especially where the public had doubts about the relative risk of tobacco.
About 80,000 people die of smoking-related diseases each year, while NHS is 2 billion pounds per year.
Clearly, while electronic cigarettes are not safe, they are only part of the harm that smoking causes - we carry out our tasks before the nation.
Former Head Channel 4 believes that BBC should end the EastEnders series
The former head of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that BBC should stop issuing programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would have much to do with a successful show such as the charity on "Albert Square".
Johnson noted that licensing fees should only be used to create programmes that are not issued by other British broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for putting public broadcasts, which probably only look at a small part of the audience, for peak airtime when competitors go to a high-rated show, and for channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had unsuccessfully tried to cooperate with BBC for six years at Channel 4.
"I cannot separate myself from the view that the BBC is preparing for the launch and broadcasting of transfers that might show competing companies that do not receive subsidies," Johnson told members of the Committee on Communications of the House of Lords in an explanation of the BBC future.
If you keep a licence collection that I do not consider as a good medium- and long-term solution, companies should leave only those programs that are not issued and are not intended to be issued by other companies.
The Voice show goes into the air at the premium because the creators want to get as much support as possible for the future.
The idea of no one showing it again is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go to funding transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one example, EastEnders is another; they are known to be their own production.
Other channels would no doubt give a lot of money to her.
I don't understand how this can be a public thing.
I don't think that'd somehow bring down the BBC.
The Senior Businessman Johnson, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC of pursuing ratings “because of the ambitions of staff and their belief that this is the best way to gain long-term support”.
His comments on the most popular show on BBC are addressed by Executive Director Sky Tony Bolla, who, in his lecture on the memory of McCagart in Edinburgh in 2003, invited BBC to sell EastEnders series.
Johnson noted that the lower BBC public transfers "are continuing to go to BBC4, where there is often no audit, but therefore the company's function is performed, and this can be presented as an argument in the Hungarian sermons justifying the income of the license fees of 4 billion pounds: "Yes, of course, we are doing all these undetectable transfers that no one sees."
They put them in a trap where no one will ever see them.
Regarding the licensing gathering, Johnson informed the Committee: "I call on you to find a more regressive system as to who will receive the most from it.
Of course, you all think that we all think 150 pounds a year is a huge amount, but for people who have 150 pounds a lot of money, I'm interested in them because they don't look at and listen to the BBC.
The former Executive Director of Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also spoke before the committee last Tuesday, said that BBC should review Rita's mission for information, education and entertainment.
He noted that only a small part of BBC material is now formally classified as educational, according to him, 1 per cent of television content and 0.1 per cent of radio content, and that the company should welcome the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the “information, education and entertainment”.
On Elstein's partnership, the BBC noted that more efforts should be made in such areas as "Remuneration concerts" (only part of them, he said, are shown on TV) and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for online viewing.
"Sonegenetics" allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows that no movement changes at a time when they are affected by sound impulses.
Scientists produced worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be managed using sound waves.
The shortness of movement does not change the direction at a time when they are affected by sound impulses that are too high for the human ear to hear them.
The pulses are affected by the activation of neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
More on: Researchers manage brain activity through light
Scientists have explained that worms are demonstrating the potential of a new technique called "sonnetics", which is the essence of using ultrasound to initiate certain cells of the brain, the heart and the muscles, while the ultrasound source is outside the body.
Schrikant Chalasani, a scientist at the Institute of Solka, La-Hoya, California, told the Guardian that this method could once replace the deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the brain and used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Red nematodes usually do not react to ultrasounds, but Chalasani discovered that they began to react when they were placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles were increasing ultrasonic waves, which then penetrated the worm’s body.
Increased ultrasonic waves affect the structures called “TRP-4 ion channels” found in the membranes of some worm cells.
The ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open and induce the cells associated with them is reported in the Nature Communications report.
For the creation of nematodes that can be controlled through ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic changes in worms, so their motor neurons used the TRP-4 ion channels.
During the use of ultrasound to affect modified organisms, sound waves were increased by microscopic bubbles and introduced into worms by activating modified motor neurons.
This method is similar to the one used in the "optogenesis" - a new direction that allows scientists to include and exclude neurons with light impulses.
Chalasani argues that compared to this method, sonogenesis can have some advantages.
Unlike the light that is delivered to the right part of the brain on the eyelid, low-frequency ultrasonic waves pass through the body’s tissues without interference, so their delivery does not need to be carried inside the skull box.
“We believe that, in order to treat some neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will in time make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasound signal,” Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the methodology could apply to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Prohibited torture equipment is directly on your threshold!
Advertising announcements are published on British arms trade
Consider the role of Amnesty International in protest against the display of weapons.
Screaming dragons!
Ruining iron chains!
Cascade bombs!
Electric noise absorbers that cause unbearable pain but do not leave traces!
The bold voice and cartoons leave no doubt that this advertisement of the largest international display of weapons is the same parody prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the intention of the British Government to “interpret” weapons by means of repressive regimes that are taking advantage of the ExCeL centre in Doklands by the exhibition of defence technologies and security systems.

But the special campaign also leads to the sudden emergence of multiple posters at bus stops and in subway trains that need to be looked at again.
"An important announcement on the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of them by a London metro line with a picture of the DLR line turning into a tank silhouette.
In September this year, a crowd of arms dealers will be burning at DLR. Passengers are asking for help to prevent the display of weapons.
300 posters were drawn by artists who exhibited their work in the "Museum of Cruel Design" in the Banky "Dismalland".
The Special Patrol Group has helped to distribute them to London using the “advertising site breaker” 6-pound set of keys, which is reported to be “accessing about a third of the advertising space on the planet’s bus stops”.
London's transporters resented such "vandalism" as unauthorized posters.
One of the paramilitary announcements issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Greendon, Curator of Cruel Designs and Teacher at Essex University, artists are becoming more demanding and are striving to bring political art to the auditorium outside the gallery.
Many artists start working with Protestant activists, realizing that they have to go into the real world because of their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the display of weapons welcoming passengers in the subway.
A video from Amnesty was viewed more than 100,000 times on Facebook 24 hours and was created by a VCCP agency working pro bono, involving graphic designer and sound artist, also working free of charge.
The creative director of VCCP Matt Lever was struck with a commercial silence about the display of weapons - with a break in the ExCel calendar - and thought, "Let them set up a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They thought of creating more realistic and illogical corporate advertising, but "to fill her house with bright colors and animation became more attractive".
"They have helped us incredibly to attract attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition," says Tom Davis of Amnesty.
We now need the British Government to take measures and ensure that this trial equipment will not be illegally sold directly at our threshold.
Perhaps the most creative art on the subject of the exhibition of weapons is within ExCeL, where participants are engaged in fantastically euphemistic production.
In the news release, Saab revealed information on the order for “AT4CS RS for shoulder shooting” from the U.S. Army.
It includes “no similar cumulative weaponry, which produces an uninterrupted barrier within the target”.
Whatever he does, it won't be nice.
Eight golden rules for living in student settlements
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student home as a normal 19-year-old, still believing in betrothal and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the smiles of those whom I have offended - and many, long-standing complaints to others.
Most of what I learned can be broken down into eight simple rules.
Transfers to the home may vary from a mild to an absolutely scary nerve.
He's trying to talk: tell people where you're from, where you've taken your academic leave and where you've taken it, whether you support Corbin and why you're "honestly, I don't love, I don't hate Marmite," because, seriously, you guys, it's just a hiccup extract, I'm gonna be there."
Take a breath.
And help others to move, too, ask questions and show interest.
This will help you to find people who like you, not those you would not even talk to, even if they were burned in the fire.
Give people space.
People's rooms are often turned into drinking establishments, semi-trailers, and public toilets, but they are also the place where people dress and repair the lower whites.
More on the subject: Don’t even think about starting a university education in relationships
Introverts at universities are unfair.
Your room must be a refuge, but many homes form a culture of Satan from one room to another, which promotes friendship, society and leads to long friendship.
It could be a hell of a man trying to restore power.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to keep dating you, but I need you to leave, and I've been able to restore the energy I've spent on communicating with you."
Try to feel when the contestant is tired of the community - and not to knock on him, but to send a text message.
I mean, about the knock: do it.
One guy in my apartment followed the principle: if the door was not locked, he was invited to come in.
He saw something.
Make friends by means of a fire.
Since you're starting a university life on the peak of the Bake-Off show, knock on the door to the people to imagine and teach the chocolate cake plate, it's no longer such a strange act, it's not like in the 1950s, 'We're welcome, we're neighbors, I've done something to you, and now you're smiling, and I'm going to ask you personal questions.'
Offering domestic accommodations is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and as a result, your face will probably associate with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how much you're a good baker.
Badly blind spots of torment, sugar and fat will make people turn to sleep when you knock on them.
Food poisoning is a typical crime in student housing.
Of course, giving someone a chicken is cheating, but isn't it a spell to get a taste of milk for tea?
Get to the owner of the milk.
He'll probably suggest you stay out of trouble, even if it's the inside of your anger.
If someone steals your stuff, it upsets you, and I feel you, but try to treat this adult more than my neighbor who poured in her milk to wash the dishes to avenge those who took him without asking.
She's in jail now.
You don't have to make noises that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be like a man, but also because you are the same people in the proverbial of glass houses.
The girl in my corridor asked the neighbor to add the sound of drums and bass guitars, as it was three in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor's noise increased.
When he finally shut up at 5:00 a.m., she kindly let him sleep for two hours, then she broke her music and locked the door and went to the three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband settled in the same residence as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extraordinary, before you bite the balls, not including, if you took the neighbor for your future wife, dragged them away, broke their relationship, and should you see him every day, and maybe watch him pull on his side all your common friends?
Of course, you won't show your heart - but if your hot neighbor isn't exactly your future husband, try to cool your own dust.
At that exciting moment when you realize that someone has left the keys inside their own locked room, the edge between the game and the grass is thinner than it seems.
A good game is fun, but it becomes the opposite in seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something - but never touch a room with a toothpaste and shampoo.
Behind the other door and drop the keys in the glass with the water that you then put in the freezer--but don't attach the other stuff to the Blu-Tack stick to the bottom more than twice.
iOS 9: How to establish a new operating system on the iPhone after an update from Apple
A new operating system can be requested by entering the Settings plugin to choose General and then Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will allow you to jump it and set it up.
Some have encountered problems after installation when a bug report has appeared telling them that the update of the annex has failed.
To avoid this, users are either advised to wait until recovery is quiet or to try to renew via iTunes.
The phone tips will allow you to complete the entire process.
The process could include the removal of applications to increase the free space - but Apple minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the updating size and also simplified implementation with the help of a special tool, which offered to remove the applications and re-establish them after the completion of the process.
You should be sure that your phone is charged or is next to the charging device to prevent battery failure.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, as the order of the phone in the process may result in the upgrade.

Washington answered Russia's military activity by telephone.
US Secretary John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support that Moscow provides to President Assad only led to an escalation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk about it with a Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
US Secretary-General John Kerry called on Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
“The secretary of Kerry made it clear that the continued support of President Assad by Russia posed a risk of exacerbating and prolonging the conflict, as well as negatively affecting our common goal of combating extremism, if we also do not continue to focus on seeking solutions to the Syrian conflict through direct transfer of power,” said the representatives of the United States Department.
They also noted that Kerry had repeatedly stressed the commitment of the United States to combat the Islamic State in a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member of her.
In addition, the United States “will be pleased with Russia’s constructive role in trying to oppose the Islamic State”.
On Friday, representatives of the White House said they did not know exactly what action the Russian troops were taking in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the matter with Moscow.
On the other hand, the White House Press Secretary Josh Ernest said that the time for a telephone conversation between President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had not yet come: "When the President decides that the telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, he will raise the pipe and try to complete the call."
Barak Obama himself considered the decision of Russia to increase the support of the Assad regime at a “funning rate”.
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him it was a mistake that further support from Assad would only make the situation worse.
"But he did not listen to my warnings - and as a result the situation worsened," said the President of the United States.
Imports will be exempt from customs duties.
Minority development is intended to temporarily release imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sport from customs duties and taxes.
The corresponding changes in the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free imports were prepared by the Ministry under the command of the Government of the FP.
The “Reports” was reported by the Assistant Minister of Economic Development Elena Laškin.
In June 2015, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, after his visit to Crimea, commissioned a number of departments - Minéconomora, Mintransa RF, Minkultura, MIDI, PMS, FSB, FTS, Rustourism - to prepare proposals to create favourable conditions for yachting in the coastal areas of the country.
In turn, experts point out that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their courts abroad - approximately €200 million per year are punished by European States for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs of Russia prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission on "To amend the list of goods temporarily released from customs duties and taxes", which provides for full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sport.
In the Ministry ' s view, this will certainly contribute to the establishment of favourable conditions for the development of yachts in the coastal zones of the country, Laškina noted.
The issue was raised by the Customs Tariff Sub-Commission, Non-tariff regulation, protection measures in the external trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which was held in September, and was also approved by the agencies as a result of the discussion.
As the representative of the Ministry of Development noted, the proposed measure on full conditional exemption from imports is in fact a benefit.
Therefore, after the adoption of the Protocol, the Sub-Commission meeting in the Government of the Russian Federation of Minéconomria will present a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for Discussion with EEA Member States, Laškina explained.
The list of imported goods, which are fully exempt from customs duties, taxes, includes goods necessary for the promotion of external economic activities and international cooperation, for the application of science, culture, cinematography, sport and tourism, for the provision of international assistance, etc., including office equipment (personal computers, writing machines), control equipment, sound equipment, stage costumes and decorations, moving laboratories and masters, water slides, goose cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and objects for religious ceremonies.
In the press service, Mintrans RF “Reports” said that binding orders had been made on the ports of Kerchi, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Eupathia, which provided for a simplified procedure for the formation and exit of small-scale, sports and leisure ships at the seaport.
The mandate of the captains of the seaports of Crimea is given by the Mintrans to ensure that small-scale, sport-pare and leisure vessels enter the seaport and exit the ships listed from the seaport.
Mintrans has also prepared draft regulations of the Government of the RF on the approval of the limits of the seaports of Crimea.
With regard to Yalta and Feodosia, the others are already in the process of harmonization, noted in the department ' s press service.
In Mintrans' view, hostmen, classification and certification, registration of small-scale vessels used for non-commercial purposes should be carried out in the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia, yachting was extremely difficult because of poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look at southern Italy and France, it is the whole ever-increasing industry that employs a large number of people.
In Russia, everything is actually in place.
Our coast is a small, only piece where boats can be operated every year is the Black Sea in Sochi, Galenjika, Novorosianska, Anapia.
But it is very difficult to see that the border service rules are extremely strict in this area: a mass of permits must be formed in order to walk on the yacht.
Besides, inside Russia, you're going to go somewhere.
Two days she can go with her fuel, and then there's a problem where to take it, says the sales director of Nordmarine Denis Novikov.
With regard to yacht storage sites, Moscow and St. Petersburg now have special yacht anchors up to 30 m. The yachts are also being shipped to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novokov noted that buyers of yachts were rich, but at the beginning of the crisis, the demand for yachts declined.
The World Bank has granted Ukraine $500 million in loans.
The World Bank approved a new loan project for Ukraine of $500 million for financial sector development.
The press of the international organization reported on this.
"New funding will support a number of priority measures to implement banking sector reforms in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," the communication said.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Cimao Fanh, said that banking sector reforms would help restore loans to the real economy and encourage economic recovery.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank had seen the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the serious problems, Fanh calls on the Government of Ukraine to accelerate reforms.
Formerly, the Polish Government approved a loan of €100 million to Ukraine, which is broadcast by the RIA News.
In prison, they are asked to create separate blocks for transgenders.
The Public Council, under the Federal Enforcement Service (FSIN), on the protection of the rights of convicted persons in October 2015, will discuss the possibility of establishing separate blocks for transgenders and transgenders in colonies.
A member of the Council of Vladislav Grib told the "Reports".
He believed that, depending on the total number of prisoners who had not had sex in Russia, it was possible for individual chambers, blocks or even (if there were many such criminals) to establish a special colony for trans-sexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that the punishment of citizens in such isolated places should be determined only after the defendants have had the appropriate medical expertise to prove that the offender was indeed a person who identified himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the safety of the executioners.
According to him, the proposed practice was successful abroad: the SISO (where accused before the court's decision) had separate transgender chambers and the correctional facilities had special blocks.
Today it is the only way out with such criminals.
They need to be isolated, since the presence of transvestants and transgenders in normal cameras is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and the sea of problems for the staff of the FSI.
The lowering of the transceivers is guaranteed, says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on the size of the big city, the number of offenders with an indefinite sex needs to be calculated where to distribute them.
Individuals don't really need SISO, just cameras, blocks in prison.
Yeah, a separate colony is possible if there's a lot of transgenders.
As Grib explained, the block may contain 50 or 100 persons, and if a specialized corps is established in Russia alone, trans-sexual prisoners will be able to proceed there from any region.
The citizen is held in the CISO at the crime scene, so the arrival of transvestites or transgenders from other entities during the investigation and trial is unrealistic, and this is what Grib considers to be a practice for those who have already been convicted in a separate colony.
Recall that the law enforcement officers had not been able to determine in which male or female investigator Dmitria Kozukova (known as Alina Davis) had been detained for drug trafficking in a 24-year-old drug detainee, and therefore a man with a virgin had not been arrested.
He was released from the house under the signature of a non-departure.
This news has been widely discussed in social networks and media, as there is no real mechanism to hold transgenders in SISOs and colonies in Russia.
Russian human rights defender, LGBT activist (LGBT - lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals) Nikolai Alexeev supported the idea of creating special places to punish transgenders, noting that it is also possible to identify men or women from outside the colony, depending on their own will.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal was correct.
Yes, it's a very small percentage, but there's a problem, as is the question of security in prisons for homosexuals, says Alexeev.
Prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be made on behalf of homosexuals, more than transgenders.
However, Alexeiev has doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are willing to give themselves over to transsexuals in order to become separate from the ordinary colony.
Of course, medical examinations can be introduced before people are placed in a colony for transgenders, but not always the same.
For example, a prisoner in the United States named Chelsea Manning looked like a man, and already in prison said he wanted to change the sex," Alexeyev said.
A person can feel who he is.
But as long as there are no separate places to punish transgenders, I doubt that prison officials will think seriously about the security of such people and be able to find their orientation or gender identification.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health in the territory of RF Boris Lordkypanidze noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transsexual offenders in the colony could greatly delay the onset of sentence.
The commission is being set up, it's a matter of sexology, and the psychiatrists are conducting long-term observations, not one test based on a high-precise conclusion.
Today's psych facilities allow that.
Therefore, in the face of gender shifts, potential patients are always going through such experiments - they are showing exactly whether gender shifts with surgical intervention are the necessary measure, says Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how this system should be implemented with regard to the convicted, as the average survey takes a month.
The doctor, although he generally supported the idea of establishing separate blocks for transsexuals, also doubted that it would be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical expertise, transgenders in Russia.
Considering it difficult, there is no official statistics, but taking into account that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, it can be said that transgenders are even smaller, and those who have such a refusal and still commit crimes are quite small, said Lord Kipanidze.
Now, at the request of the administration of the colony of homosexuals, transgenders can obtain certain conditions of content.
Michael Antipov won a junior chess world championship.
In Hunti-Mansijske, the world chess championship was completed by 20 years of age.
The completion of the championship was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and he became Russian Michael Antipov, who had yet to push the Pole Jan-Cshitof Dudou, who would certainly have gone to the title.
The girl's victory was celebrated by Ukrainian chessman Natalie Boxes.
The World Chess Championship, which took place from the beginning of September in Hunti-Mansijske, had seemed to have lost almost all of its intrigue, since the representative of Poland, Jan-Kschistof Duda, who issued a series of four victories (competitions carried out by the Swiss system on 13 tours), had certainly taken the lead.
Given that Duda was a favorite award winner, yes and indeed one of the most promising young chess players, the probability that he would miss the winning break was very small.
And even when Duda dropped the traffic and allowed the Russian Mikhail Antipo to reduce the distance to 0.5 balls, he remained a clear favorite in the fight for title.
For Antipo had to win the leader in the 13th round.
But it wouldn't even help you win your party.
In addition, this obligation to win could, of course, affect the Russian chess game and lead to inevitable mistakes.
Fortunately, Michael Antipov was able to avoid them.
He certainly dealt with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he was forced to wait when his party ended with Doda, who met with Benjamin Bok.
Fortunately, for Antipova, the Polish shammatist suffered opposition to the Dutch destroyer.
Thus, Antipos and Duda had an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipos had the best additional indicators.
That is why the leadership of the Hunty-Mansian Autonomous District, whose governor, Natalya Komarov, traditionally devoted great attention to the development of chess in the region, gave the main prize.
And that's not what happened in the contests.
The leader of the tournament - Natalie Buxe (Ukraine) - had not lost enough to win the title in the last round, which she had successfully done.
Thus, the victory of Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to touch the Box.
The Russian sportsman remained the second to retire from the championship in 0.5 balls.
The impact is changing the regional structure.
The company brings the Baltic and Ural regions together in one united Volzko-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East, to the Eastern region.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
According to Director-General Wimpelkoma, Michael Slobodin, changes are being made to “remain a strong player on the market”, to develop a company “in new, not always favourable external conditions”.
In an interview with the Russian 24 telechannel, Mr. Slobodin stated that they were going to reduce the ten per cent staff in Russia.
He checked 78 Moscow's Burger King breakfasts and issued 367 prescriptions.
As a result, the restaurant on the Volokolam Shossa was fined 50 thousand rubbings, and the establishment on the Big Tull Street was closed for 90 days, but resumed after all violations had been eliminated.
43 breakfasters violated the requirements for the device.
Among other violations, inadequate sanitation and sanitation facilities, non-compliance with ventilation requirements, have been found in some establishments by the bacterium group.
The Burger King brand's franchise is owned by the Burger Russ, the owner of the Chocolate Network by Alexander Kolobova, and works 293 breakfasts in Russia.
Igor Artemiev, Head of FAS, said that the department opposed the indexation of 10 per cent of freight tariffs and the provision of hospitality, as requested by the OASR.
At first, they wanted 17% of the index, now they wanted 10%, and even billions of budget subsidies, he said.
We're saying that it's wrong, it's too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, turn away from expensive characters, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money on the left and right.

Sumeru has until 3 October time to make an option or require a supplement.
The details of the negotiations in Polymetal do not reveal.
The option was included in the purchase of Polymetal Project "Kizil" in Kazakhstan.

Minpromtorg: Addressing food aid will not be a similar card in the USSR.
The Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia, Viktor Eutuvov, said that the food aid programme would not be the same as the food distribution system in the USSR.
It is a modern food aid to the population and the support of an effective domestic freight producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate about the word "food card."
In particular, it should be noted that the proposed product maps should not be discounted with a total deficit over time, a distribution card system where the quantity of the products received is determined.
We have so far proposed the concept, if it is approved, we will propose amendments to the legislation," says Mr. Eutuhova.
Previously, U wrote that the food card introduction programme for the poor had been introduced to the Government.

This year's study of the Association of Russian Managers "Top-1000 Russian Managers" is 16th time.
As a tool to assess the professional reputation of the Russian top Eschelon managers, the study has led to the results of the work of the Russian administrations per year, identifying leaders in the sectors and functional areas.
The primary pool of candidates consists of award winners last year.
The winners of last year are invited to confirm their participation as candidates for the current year ' s rating and to appoint members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates included in the initial list proposes to bring up to ten new managers from other companies, which would be appropriate to add to the overall pool of candidates.
Possible deployment of the following company functional managers: Financial Director, Commercial Director, Marketing Director, Personnel Director, IT Director, Public and Corporate Communications Director, Director of Authority Relations, Corporate Management Director.
Each proposed expert will be invited to participate in the rating and will be given the opportunity to appoint its management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
The sector-specific nomination of candidates is based on a sectoral classification of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forestry and forestry industry, machinery, media business, metallurgics, multi-profile holding, professional services, communications and telecommunications, services and consumer goods production, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel.
Login and password are provided to each participant for access to www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information on the remaining participants and can submit their assessments on the proposed criteria for each functional direction.
The rating methodology is based on the "Beautiful choose of the best" principle: top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
Such a principle allows for the maximum authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are confirmed at the meetings of the expert commissions.
The expert commissions are invited to make an eye-opening invitation to all candidates for the current year ' s rating and multiple candidates for the previous year ' s rating.
The Commission shall be organized on a functional basis: the list of top leaders and eight commissions for the approval of top executives.
The meetings of the expert commissions are proposed to approve the lists submitted in alphabetical order (places are strictly maintained by the internet and closed prior to the publication of the rating) or to update them according to the list of reserve candidates attached.
The names of companies are given in accordance with the rules in Russian and the rules of "U".
At the time of publication of the rating, possible changes in the status of managers and companies.
A comfortable rate for investment is 10-13%.
Experts estimate that the credit market for small and medium-sized enterprises in January-April this year was 40 per cent.
What do you think is the situation today?
After the panic attacks at the end of 2014, the credit levels of IBS declined significantly in 2015.
The reason is a sharp increase in interest rates.
No one benefited from funding under 25-30 per cent of the year.
If the bank had previously been able to raise all its potential problems in the future, from time to time, it was impossible to do so: rates and so cloudy.
For the business, the current level of ICB credit rates is uncomfortable.
For a large part of the investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their employability.
The rate rate of 10-13 per cent would allow business to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive income.
How much do you think the demand for loans for entrepreneurs is met?
After a decrease in the percentage rate of CBs, the situation improved somewhat.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers have turned to loans very rarely.
First of all, business does not understand the prospects for its development and future income.
Today, business has one outcome: we need to learn to work, focusing on today's economic situation in the country and region.
It is necessary to monitor the current results more closely, to monitor the flow of money.
At the same time, with financial resources available, new technologies should be used to modernize equipment, reduce production and energy costs.
All of this, in the end, allows companies to make production more competitive and to keep business even in a unstable economic situation.
What key trends in the ICB credit market will be strengthened and will affect its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The average rate reduction forecast will depend heavily on Central Bank policy, and the regulator is now demonstrating consistency in the issue of the key rate reduction.
However, there is no need to wait for the radical fall in the credit price for the ICB.
In the current situation, inflation is, in particular, a problem that makes the rate of interest required to obtain real income.
In addition, the value of money in Russia remains high even when the CB rates are reduced.
With regard to the level of delay, traditional small and medium-sized enterprises, which are limited both in cash and in terms of economic behaviour, will undoubtedly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I would not expect a substantial reduction in the proportion of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the economy of the country.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That is how the word Mazda is written by Japanese ieroglyphics.
Beautiful, laconic and at the same time quite complicated for those who are accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.
As well as the new CX-5 crossover, as well as any other brand model: an attractive outside, technically made inside.
The Japanese are simply able to bring the goods of the rising sun to full alert because of its "Japanese " .
It may be possible to argue in favour of cars from other countries, and even in principle, people will agree with these arguments, but the whole conversation will unfold with the final phrase: "But this is a Japanese car!
Don't argue about it!
Such people are likely to love not only technology but everything else in Japan.
Citing from Basse's walk, bringing in beans, collecting catacombs, and dressing their friends - not in kimonos, of course, but in Japanese street fashion: nice, creative and very unexpected.
Please, the Japanese school form is the only form that girls enjoy and after finishing school.
It has amazing properties: both sensitive and strict.
And than a girl older, that pretty little thing.
The main change in the outside CX-5 is the five horizontal lines radiator grid.
But where does the car change the shape of the new image of the headlamps and the rear lamps, which the car is currently known in the flow of cars?
As before, Mazda CX-5 looks very flattering.
Siluette is harmonious, sensitive, but its appearance is acute.
There's no need to call the police.
Under the CX-5, one of the safest in the world, only Japanese peace can be experienced.
The 2.2 l diesel engine provides a high torque in the wide range of speeds.
The fuel consumption of this engine is 175 litres of total power of 5.9 litres. The power aggregate is compiled exclusively by automatic transmission and full transmission.
Black boots, black coat, black bag...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can select the leggins with a print from the Not Cross police tape.
On the other hand, in Mazda, they have made the most of their efforts to ensure that you are not on the scene of your own VAT.
In order to increase comfort, while maintaining excellent governance, the substations have been redesigned by front and rear amortizers, as well as optimized the form of front-ends.
The full-purpose system has been adapted under Russian conditions.
The noise level of the road and the high speed engine is reduced by 13%.
The bathroom in the flower or floor is as boring as the budget seat.
It's another matter if a girl grows up in a bathroom with an original drawing.
For example, from a computer game in a role-playing warrior's genre.
She'll get no less attention then than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has improved design for both front and rear seats, which provides optimal space for both wide shoulders and long legs.
Other long-standing figures estimate that the emphasis in the front of the central tunnel is now soft and does not fall on the drawers in the expressions.
The widest set of Mazda active security systems is proposed at CX-5.
Radars, lasers and cameras are used to identify potential threats.
There is both adaptive lighting, and a warning of the rise from the field, and monitoring of the dead zones, and safe braking.
Mazda CX-5 has one of the best luggage in the class.
A suitable, minimally speaking, it incorporates a load of 561 litres. The rear seats are in the ratio of 4:2:4 - each section is supplied with a separate output handle - and increases the luggage section to 1560 litres.
The costume of a hero multifilm in Japan is called "kigurums."
It looks particularly tangy.
She can do anything!
Of course to sleep.
But it's still about having fun with little kids.
Or just walk around like that on the street...
It's so cool when there's a choice of dress, behavior or car.
Thank you for helping prepare the Kawaicat store material.
Kiev has broken the atomic union.
Kiev formally rejected Ukraine's cooperation with Russia on the construction of the AES Hmelnik.
The High Council, however, voted on Wednesday with a second attempt to break the agreement with Moscow.
Agreements for the construction of the third and fourth blocks were signed in 2010-2012, but the project was not successful.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Council of Ukraine adopted a law derogating from the 2010-2012 agreement with the RF on the construction of the third and fourth block at the AES Hmelnik.
The draft law submitted by the Government was only successful with a second vote, with 210 MPs being supported for the first time at a minimum of 226, but 234 members of Parliament were then voted in favour of the draft.
The initial project Hmelnikka AES was to have four 1-GWt power blocks with VER-type reactors, but only two were able to build.
Negotiations with Moscow on construction led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010 and the Council adopted the relevant laws in 2011-2012.
Since there was no funds in Ukraine's budget, it was expected that the building of blocks would be credited to the Russian side, but no funds had been allocated.
Following the conversion to Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in relation to the two countries, Kiev began to deepen relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, declaring its refusal to cooperate on the AES Hmelnik and on the project of construction of the nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where relations remained remained remains the purchases in the RF fuel for the current Ukrainian AES (approximately half of electricity generation in the country), as the Ukrainian NAEC Energoat replaced Russian supplies with something.
The Hmelnika AES integration plans with the other contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively rejected: negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS were announced in Kiev in 2014.
UN Gensec against the use of military force in the resolution of the Syrian conflict.
During the press conference, UN Secretary-General Pan Ki-moon reported that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
"There is no military solution," says AP, in response to the question of military support from Syria by Russia.
Mr. Gui Moon also announced that he would meet with the Foreign Ministers of the Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the heads of FDI of UNSCR permanent members later this month.
"There will be a meeting in Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief of Genstab VS Russia Nikolai Bogdanovski reported that Genstab would not exclude the possibility of a future VSB base in Syria.
There's no such plan yet.
"But anything can be," said Mr. Bogdanovski.
Earlier, U reported that the United States did not trust the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, who stated that military assistance to the official Damascus was necessary to combat the banned terrorist group "Islamic State" in the RF.

In PA, OSCE reports on a possible meeting of the parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine to the Parliamentary Assembly (PA) of OSCE, Arthur Gerasimov, reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in the south-east of Ukraine.
"What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," says Mr. Gerasimov.
He also called for mine agreements and for "returning to the normal viability of our countries".
In his view, dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level is possible, either in the Norman format or in the form of a contact group at the PA OSCE, Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue had been conducted, there were mining agreements.
At the same time, policies in Kiev support all types of dialogue.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine in the negotiations, former President Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-declared Donecka and Lugana Republic had not in principle changed their position in the tripartite negotiations, but the tone of the dialogue had become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the Lower New York Electoral Commission subjugated the results of the City Hall elections on the municipal district by distributing 12 parliamentary mandates on the party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of election violations were made by representatives of the CRC who had been accused of "covering counterfeits".
No comments from the opposition were received.
Together, the Russian Communist parties refused to hold a referendum on the abolition of rents for multi-quarter houses.
The city election officially presented the results of the elections in the pride of Lower New York City in the municipal electoral district.
The total number of voters in Lower Novorode was 1.03 million, the number of ballots for voting in the local commissions was 746.7 thousand, and the number of voters was 268 thousand.
More than 11.7,000 ballots were invalid and 24 lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were allocated to political parties, depending on their votes.
According to the lists of Russia's only six seats in pride are Dmitri Sutkovski, Dmitri Krasnov, Vasili Shupranov, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Viacheslav Rasteriev and Igor Nagorno.
The sole mandate of the LDPR was given by the leader of the Vladimir Girinovski party.
The two mandates of the CRC are allocated between Vladimir Bulanov and the Member of the Parliament, Alexander Tarnaev.
The three mandates of “Just Russia” are given to Alexander Razmowski, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalugin.
For five days now, these candidates must determine whether they will work as deputies in the town floor: in the event of a refusal of a mandate, they will go to the next candidate on the part of the party.
The President of the Goizbircoma, Alexander Makeev, informed the members of the Commission that he had introduced travel arrangements for "the transmission of Girinovski telegrams and others" to the object of refusal of mandates.
In approving the protocol on the outcome of the elections, the representatives of the CRC reported multiple violations.
A speaker with the right to vote by CRC Leonid Krasnokutsky suggested that the outcome of the vote in four districts No.21-24 should be denied, recalling that, under the authority of the Sorom Region, the head of the administration had closed the entrance to the administration building, where four district commissions had been available.
Within a long time, no members of the Gos Dumma, no candidates, no observers could pass, and a resonance scandal with the front door was shown on the television.
At the meetings of the district commissions, all observers and members of the commissions with the right to vote had the opportunity to attend.
Their head had stopped access only when the vote had been closed and the local commissions had not yet come to deliver their ballots.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
"The head was then repaired, and at all meetings interested persons could be present," said a member of the Andreushin mountain electorate.
The Communists objected to the fact that the blocked administration building had illegally held a member of the Lummil Aristov Congregation for more than four hours, in which a statement was sent to the investigating committee.
The opposition also regretted that, on the day of the elections, several WICs began to seal the urns at 6-7 a.m. tomorrow, giving them ballots for a preliminary vote.
However, the members of the Committees with the right to a meeting vote and observers had not been notified, so they arrived at the beginning of the elections on 8 a.m.
The Communists are convinced that in the morning before the opening of the polling stations, ballots could be thrown out of control.
However, the mountain, which has already considered more than 124 complaints on various occasions, says Alexander Makeev, has not found any violations of the inputs of unrecorded ballots.
Members of the Commission did not support the proposal of their colleague from “Just Russia” Maria Popovov, through the text of the amendments to the regional legislation, to establish a clear time frame for the opening of pre-term ballots.
"On your own initiative, even in the CEC," advised Ms. Popova Alexander Makeev.
At the end of the meeting, a member of the CRC, Sergey Samahin, who called for the election to ignore dozens of complaints and to cover the falsification of elections.
"You're not here at the meeting, be careful!" the president of the election was offended.
As a result, the protocol was approved almost unanimously.
By 27 September, the election would have to adopt the general results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the City Hall of the Sixth Assembly would be held within three weeks.
In addition to the definition of election results, the city electoral commission rejected the Russian Communist political party in the registration of an initiative group to hold a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were going to discuss two issues: do they agree that the cost of carpentry of multi-quarter houses should be “cut off immediately” and the rates for housing and municipal services “frozen by 2020”.
However, Irina Maslov's lawyer explained that the treatment of the Communists of Russia was contrary to the law.
The FedEx sample is a mixed character, a reduction in forecasts for 2016.
FedEx reported the unconventional results of the last quarter, and the delivery service giant reduced the annual income forecast due to the fall in demand for freight services and increased costs in its sub-division of land transport.
The company also stated that it plans to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx reported that he would hire 50,000 temporary workers for holidays.
Its shares amounted to approximately 2.5 per cent in the preliminary trades in 45 minutes before the opening of the stock exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that he planned to earn from $10.40 to $10.90 in the financial year ending next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts estimated $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
The forecast is down despite an average rate of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and an increase in the charges for land transport of heavy goods or goods starting in November.
The company stated that it was still planning a profit increase compared to last year by reducing costs, increasing gross income and increasing online trade.
The President and CEO Fred Smith said that the company “had worked stablely on the basis of the weak, compared to the forecast, economic conditions, especially in production and world trade”.
The work force plans for the holidays were announced on the following day after the competitor ' s statement, UPS, that they planned to employ more than 95,000 staff, about as much as they had been employed last year.
For the quarter that ended 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 per cent more than a year earlier.
The share income was $2.42, close to an average of $2.44 for the Zacks Investment Research survey.
Income increased by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts questioned Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from falling into the fast-paced international transport sector, resulting in a lack of gross income in its express transport sub-division.
However, the purchase boom on the Internet has improved dramatically in FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the land transport surplus increased by 29 per cent, but operating income remained largely unchanged due to increased costs for large shipments and self-insurance.
The express transport unit received higher income due to higher basic rates, while income in the freight sector fell due to increased wage costs.
In the preliminary auctions about an hour before the opening of the stock exchange, FedEx fell by $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, dropped by 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent below the 11 June record.
At the most anticipated meeting of several years, the Federal Reserve System leaders will hold two days this week at a 27-foot table from the Honduras red tree, deciding not to raise the key interest rate for the first almost ten years.
At one end of a well-cooked room for two-storey highs will write a vivid picture of the United States.
This card is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve System, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues, must place the economic interests of the country above all others.
The Central Bank received a double mandate from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and to maintain stable prices here.
But since the Great Depression, the leaders of the Federal System have acknowledged that there is also a third, unwritten order: financial stability.
And this third order may be an unknown factor in the almost projected decision, which will be announced Thursday, whether the US economy is ready to get rid of the unprecedented incentive provided by the almost zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most data show a reliable growth in the economy, recent shocks on world financial markets can also keep federal system leaders careful of adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds, even at only four percentage points.
"It is clear that the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsey M. Peegza, the chief economist of the broker company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"At the same time, I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise the interest that has increased uncertainty around the world market, it would be enough to give them the excuse to wait any longer," she noted.
There is no consensus on what they are doing in the Federal Reserve System, which in itself is causing a fluctuation in the financial market.
About half of the economists recently surveyed in Bloomberg predicted a percentage increase this week.
The financial markets, however, expect the Federal system to refrain from this, while the key indicator shows only about 30 per cent of the probability of rapid recovery.
This may lead to a decline in the stock market if the Federal system raises the rate, provided that decision-makers do not slow down by promise that the next increase will be soon.
The Dow-Johns index rose to 228.89 points on Tuesday, or 1.4%, to 16 599.85.
Flying was triggered by expectations that the federal system strategy would be left at a rate this week, said John Lonski, the lead economist of the Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It'll be a surprise if the Federal system increases interest at this time," he noted.
If the Federal Reserve System management does so, "they will have to go far in adopting their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so that they do not panic."
Other experts objected that a higher rate could calm down financial markets, since this would remove uncertainty about how the Federal System would operate.
A whole month ago, the Federal system seemed inclined to raise a rate of 0.25 per cent this month, making the first small step in a slow financial tightening, which could confirm the stability of the United States recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expected an increase in the rate this year, despite the liberal complaints that there was a need for greater economic progress.
Although the emergence of new jobs slowed in August, the labour market growth was stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1 per cent last month, which was the lowest rate in more than seven years, and almost at the level that the Federal system considered full employment.
The increase in wages shows signs of acceleration.
And while inflation continues to be below the target of 2 per cent of the central bank of the year, the federal system's leadership stated that the key cause was the temporary effect of a sharp drop in oil prices.
The economy “may be able to cope with higher rates and needs them, given the reduction of the labour market,” noted Ian Sheferdson, chief economist Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China had failed its currency.
The Dou-Johns average index for industrial companies fell by 16 per cent relative to the record high in May, as investors were afraid that China's slowdown could slow global growth.
The market has partially restored its position this month, and the Dow-Johns index is now about 10 per cent below the highest May value.
In order to manage the Federal Reserve System, market retrieval is further complicated by the simple calculation of the interest rate increase.
“In the absence of information about what happened in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would have turned their backs on this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Federal Reserve Officer.
Now, according to its forecasts, they will wait at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
“There is great uncertainty about the impact on the American economy, and they have almost no reliable data after the recent developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not the main concern of the Federal System, and it should not be technically taken into account in the adoption of those decisions.
But essentially the Federal Reserve system has become the world financial power.
The impact of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
Only one hint from then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve System could "deplete" its monetary expansion caused the shocks of markets worldwide.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwining, it could be expected that leaders of the Federal Reserve would not only monitor developments everywhere but also consult representatives of other Central Banks and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process - "sooner art than science" - noted Zakari Karabell, director of Investnet Inc - a company that is engaged in global state management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, President of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank, Virginia, noted this month that “there have been cases of an excessive reaction in the history of the Federal Reserve System to the movement of the financial market which appears to be unrelated to economic principles”.
Lacer, a member with the right to vote of the influential Federal Committee on the Open Market, which insisted on a higher rate, was an example of decision 1998-99.
The financial crisis in Asia has led to the federal system lowering its base rate by 0.75% for three meetings, “in spite of limited identified effects for growth in the United States”, Laker said.
The federal system leaders cancelled these reductions a year later.
The federal reserve system should first place stability only in times of major crises, such as market turmoil in 2008," said Adam S. Pozen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest-setting committee.
The last panic didn't get close to this level, he said.
"Of course, you would not want to be in a situation where you are afraid of rising rates because of the shock of the markets," said Pozen, President of the World Economic Institute of Peterson.
The Federal Reserve System Act continues to have a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I do not think they should prevent events.

Speaker Sergey Narishkin admits that the United States intends to destabilize the situation in the Middle East so that the waves of refugees can retreat to Europe.
As Interfax reports, he expressed such an opinion to journalists in Ulan-Bator in the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a proponent of conspiracy theories, but the question is, is it not Europe's ultimate goal for those who have destabilized the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East in recent years?" he asked.
"It is likely that someone has suggested and knew that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and disadvantaged people who are being saved from death, are reaching out to good EU countries," he added.
Nariškin wondered: "Have many political leaders in Europe openly expressed the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which is now literally spoiling their countries?".
"No, old Europe, with a rare exception, prefers to shut up," he said.
According to Nariskin, NATO supports many European values and norms of international law.
"Europe, unfortunately, has long and impartially looked at and looked at how the NATO standards of military soap and moral ideals and basic principles and norms of international law are being broken down," the speaker stressed.
The opposition from the government forces and their loyal military formations will be against the rebels, mostly Islamic.
Later, the banned terrorist group "Islamic State" in Russia joined the Syrian Government's opponents.
The United States of America supports rebels who oppose both Asada and IG.
Official Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
The President of Syria called the cause of an unfriendly West towards Russia.
The Western claims to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact the fact that they are sovereign States.
That was the view expressed by Syrian President Bashar Assad in an interview with RT, First Channel, Russia 24, NTV, Russia today, TACS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Assada, the West does not accept partners and sovereign States.
In those countries, he would like to remove one person and place another in his place, which would act for the Western countries, rather than for his Family, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the sudden development of Western media with the beginning of the conversion to Ukraine.
According to him, Russia's President Vladimir Putin “ turned from the other West to the enemy, the king, the dictator, who suppresses the Russian opposition, which came to power in a non-democratic way, despite his election as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West”.
Putin called on the world community to unite forces with Assad to fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the continued statements of the West that Assad himself must leave, he noted that the President came to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he did, on the demand of the people, rather than the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva communiqué.
"If the people want him to remain -- the president remains -- and otherwise he should leave immediately," he stressed.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled their cooperation.
Syria is also fighting terrorism together with neighbouring Iraq.
Speaking of Iran's military support, the Syrian leader noted that the country supported the Syrian State in its policies, economics and military areas.
He rejected the claim that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tegeran's supplying us with military equipment.
"Of course, there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been made," he explained.
With regard to other States, we are open to cooperation with any of them, with a strong desire to fight terrorism.
"We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorism and anti-igil coalition known by the United States," Assad said.
The number of deaths exceeded 230 thousand, the number of refugees at 11.5 million.
Part of the territory has taken over the Islamic State terrorist group, which is banned in Russia.
The International Coalition, head of the United States, is hitting IG from the air.

Reuters reports on this with reference to the representative of Mr. John Kirby.
It is noted that the topic of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.

Borodai called the U.S. newspaper a lie on the arrow.
The former president of the Government of the self-proclaimed Donkey People's Republic of Alexandria Borodai rejected the information published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said that in a phone interview with the correspondent "Lenta.ru".
The note in Washington Post is wonderful because it's all completely twisted.
Former Minister of Defence of the DND Igorya Strelkova, of course, no one has connected and "extended" from the territory of the Republic of Donbass in a very subordinated mood, without rope, without three fur money that is attributed to him by different characters," he noted.
According to Borodya, the story of the Arrow in conversation with the reporter of the American newspaper really went.
"Yes, I said that Strelkova was urgently required to remove the territory of the People's Republic of Donetsk," said the former head of the DNR Government.
Borodai stressed that he did not know why the correspondent of the U.S. edition decided to write that the Arrows had been exported to the territory of Russia as "connected".
I suspect it's a provocation.
If it is not a provocation, it is a strangely misunderstood word, because I have stressed that the Arrows have gone alone," noted Borodai.
"It's a curse to me and to the Arrow," he said.
Earlier on the pages of The Washington Post, an article in which Borodya stated that he had taken the Arrow to Russia in a coercive manner.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he had to bind his comrade.
The Polish authorities began to search for a train with the gold of the Nazis.
Polish foresters began cutting trees over the underground tunnel, where they reportedly had been on a Third Reich gold train.
The work started on Tuesday, September 15th, Reuters reports.
According to military experts, it is necessary to clear the forest in order to verify the reliability of the railways.
Weapons and valuable minerals may be within the train.
On 31 August, the Governor of the Polish Lower Silesian leadership, Tomasz Smolarz, assumed that the new evidence of the existence of a gold train was no more convincing than that of the previous.
However, the authorities decided to close the search area.
Three days earlier, the Deputy Minister of Culture of Poland, Petr Zuhovski, said that local landowners with a 99 per cent probability had found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich, mentioned in legends.
Jukhovski noted that if the assumptions were confirmed and the values were found, they would become the property of the State's punishment, while the secrets would not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two legal firms approached the authorities of the Polish city of Valbži, reporting that they had found a train in a frozen tunnel at a depth of 70 metres.
The Chief Narcotician of the RF suggested prohibiting the sale of tobacco to persons under the age of 21.
The main drug addict in Russia proposed to prohibit the sale of tobacco until the age of 21.
Eugenie Brown noted that before that age, “loved psychoactive substance — tobacco, alcohol, drugs — has been particularly harmful”.
So he said in the direct air of the Moscow-speaking radio station, commenting on the fact that the speaker, Sovfeda Valentina Matvinko, supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under the age of 21.
Man grows unevenly.
You can serve in the army for 18 years, a person physically ready for this.
He has been mentally ready for full life in society since he was 21.
"It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry, is finally only growing by the age of 21, " - Brown noted.
Earlier a member of the Public Chamber and head of the project "Russia", Sultan Hamzaev reported to the "Reports", that Matvinko supported the initiative to increase the age of alcohol sales and "agreed to re-optimize the issue with the Public Chamber at the top of the House of Parliament".
According to the activist, the Council of the Federation will soon set up a working group to develop a bill under the direction of Matvinko.
The Bible requested that the law on the protection of children be reviewed
The population of Novosibirska requested the Regional Prosecutor ' s Office to check the Bible for compliance with the Federal Law on the Protection of Children from Information That Injures Their Health and Development, with a statement dated 16 September, by Correspondent Sib.fm.
The author claimed that on August 26, 2015, he obtained a Bible at the Chinese Town store in the Red Box, published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society.
In his book, he found fragments that, in his view, violated the F.C. on the protection of children from information that is harmful to their health and development.
On 16 September, a statement was adopted by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of Novosibirsk.
The response to the treatment of Novosibirska will take 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, commented the complainant to the correspondent Sib.fm.
Moreover, it is a fundamental problem that will stir society up.
It will begin to read the Bible, which has not been done before.
Brazilian Paediatric Union of Rio Grandes promotes healthy nutrition for breast-feeding
The Brazilian Paediatric Organization SPRS has devised a scandalous method that aims to convince women of the need for full feeding during breast feeding: the method implies the demonstration of images of infants who are breast-feeding, as defined by images of harmful food.
The breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to develop a strong immune system.
In view of the high energy requirements for pregnant and pregnant women, it is recommended to increase the daily calorie rate by approximately 500 calories per day.
However, the recent study shows that one increase in calories is not the only change in the diet that mother should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, Professor of Medical College Baylor in Texas, found that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the expression of genes in children and prevents them from developing moods.
Regrettably, adverse effects of malnutrition on the immune system of the child have been identified.
A school bus broke down under Hamburg’s train.
A train broke into a school bus near Hamburg, which stuck on the railway.
The 23-year-old driver, realizing that he could not move from the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute later, they had a collision in their eyes.
He was filmed by one of the schoolboys.
An accident caused panic among students.
Some children began to cry and run along the fence.
The road is still blocked.
According to the police, no one was affected by a miracle except for one passenger who was injured easily.
Accidents were estimated at 300 thousand euros.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The management of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) called for the ban on boxing in the country after the death of local sportsman David Brown-young.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died of injuries received in conjunction with Filipino Carlo Magali.
The battle for one of the regional titles of the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the spring category up to 57.15 kg, held on Friday, ended with the victory of Magali in the 12th round.
Brown fell into a hospital with a skull-brained trauma.
His condition was considered critical, and he was connected to life-saving equipment.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two defeats, and one battle ended in destruction.
He's got two kids left.
This is already the second case of a summer outing among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, a 23-year-old student named Breedon Smith died.
AMA now recommends not to engage in this kind of sport, but rather, in its view, that it should be prohibited at all.
I understand this is happening unintentionally, said Vice-President of the Steven Pernis organization.
But as there is a boxing now, there will always be situations where a sportsman gets bleeding or brain injury, which leads either to death or to serious injury.
That is why AMA believes that we cannot continue living with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that brings together practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Nariskin called on PA OSCE to abolish sanctions against the FP parliamentarians.
The Speaker of Mr. RF Sergei Narishkin called the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians to be inadmissible.
He said so, speaking at the OSCE PA session in Ulan-Bator.
We regard this as an unacceptable act, as an expression of the value of parliamentary diplomacy.
“And this should not be repeated because it is a manifestation of political intolerance and a disregard for the principles of open international dialogue,” said the politician.
In addition, Narishkin called on the OSCE PA participants to restore the Russian and EU partnerships.
Let's put morals back in politics.
Let us return dialogue and the right to international communication.
Let's put humanistic ideals back in democratic order.
"The double never ended well," he said.
Speaking from the Parliamentary Assembly tribunal, the speaker of the Russian Parliament called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security challenges.
"First, to resolve the Ukraine crisis by negotiating and bringing our inter-parliamentary group together immediately," Narishkin said.
He also noted the need to pay tribute to the OSCE.
"This is almost the only common area where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," said the politician.
It is recalled that the sixtieth session of the Parliamentary Assembly was opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulan-Bator, and will extend until 18 September.
I enjoyed winning a few days.
The champion of peace on the light athletes Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumphal event for a 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergey Shubenkova.
He managed at his crown distance 110 meters with barriers to win at the European Command Championship, to establish several records, and chiefly to become a world champion, the first in the history of the national barrier print.
In addition, the sportsman recently won the final stage of the British League, taking third place in general.
The "New News" asked Shubenkov to share the impressions of the emerging season.
Sergei, the season is not over for you yet?
Yes, I'm going to play World War Games, which will take place in October in Korea, and then I'll think about rest.
True, preparing for home now, in Barnau, and being home is a completely different situation.
It's easier than going around the world every week.
You said the fall was a favorite time of the year for you.
The end of August, the beginning of September is a wonderful time.
After the main start of the season, the burden of responsibility is gone.
We can compete in pleasure at the "slabon".
Plus, you know you're gonna leave soon enough...
Is there fatigue?
It's a special season, a lot of positive emotions...
The stability of the season is always high by the end of the season.
And it doesn't matter what he did more than win or lose.
Every competition is stress.
Permanent crossings, movements, all of this is not happening to the body immediately.
You get up physically and emotionally.
But now, of course, I have emotions on the rise.
What's there? I'm just happy!
By the time you finished the peace championship in Beijing, do you come back often?
It's happening.
Yeah, and you journalists don't let me forget about it.
But at all times, I think that the bad sportsman who lives with the old winnings is running his successful races again and again.
He enjoyed winning a few days, and he had to move on.
Was the preparation for this remarkable season very different from the usual?
I can't say that there was something so special.
We got ready in December, but I missed the winter competition season.
He was first trained at the house in Barnaule, then at the meetings, and then back at the house.
It's all normal.
But the coach and I were asked to try to get to a new level that I haven't been to yet.
Almost all winter time has been spent building a base.
They ran a bunch of cross-sections, they did exercises on the physical training, which included both weight and presence, and we pushed the back.
Then, after taking the barrier training, they worked a lot on the technique.
For what do the rivals say, follow?
I'm always trying to do this, and there's no problem in the Internet.
He saw a winter European champion, and there the whole pedestal was taken by the French!
I was thinking, there's something I need to do, break up this company.
With each start in this season, you added and added results.
Did that give you confidence?
I've got all the last seasons on about the same schedule.
It's not like I'm running 13.20, and then it's 13.50.
I'm always messing up my form gradually.
The main thing you wanted to do is escape for 13 seconds.
All the work was focused on this outcome.
But the paradox is that you feel like you're ready for the competitions, and the competitions are not always ready.
How was that, for example, at the Olympics in London?
I'm, if you're right, this semi-final run (Shubenkov couldn't get back to the finals.
It was ready very well, really could have escaped in 13 seconds.
Even if he repeated his best result at that moment, he would become the bronze knight of the Game.
But not luckily.
Remember your first world championship?
How so?
It was in Tagu.
I really wanted to go to the finals, that was the maximum program.
And he's gone straight out of the morning, in the preliminary run.
Then he realized that breaking and wearing a head fracture means no escape at all.
Two years later, at the World Cup in Moscow, he went to the finals with a better time.
I remember my feelings in front of the decisive race: I really wanted to win the gold by then!
How do you manage to develop such speed, not lose your head, not turn off?
And that's the most difficult thing to do.
It needs to be very accurate, focusing on technology to keep the barriers from falling.
He noticed that when you're working not on the result, but on the process, it's so much easier.
And the only time you feel like you're running out of coffee is when you feel like you're on your own!
To be honest, it's worth it.
Many of our deep - seated athletes are trying to move closer to the capital after their first serious successes.
Has there never been such a thought?
It's still better at home.
I don't even imagine where I'm without my coach, who I need?
Maybe it would be better to have better conditions, but I'm trying to be happy with what I have.
C's the key you've been together for a long time?
Since he was 12 years old, since he got into a light sport.
More precisely, I started training with his wife, who worked with the children, and then she handed me over.
I started with a sprint, then in the length of the draw, a triangular.
Children's volleyball was - it's when they aim at the ball, they pull in the distance from the place...
At 14, he tried to run with the barriers, and I liked it.
From the first run, the second adult standard was met.
That's it.
There's never been any fear of barriers?
It's been a while since they made a deal.
But there's always been a lot of work to do on technology.
How much pain he must have suffered on one occasion!
But there's no way out of this routine.
The technique has to be kept in touch, so that I can wake up at night, I get up right away and run through the barriers.
All those who saw your race in Beijing claim it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
Usually I don't reassess my escapes, and I couldn't stay here.
But there is no limit to improving efficiency.
Don't you fear now that winning a year before the Olympic Games will be a heavy burden on your shoulders?
As they say, I am trying to justify my expectations.
Once he chose this route, he has to go to the end.
My coach likes to say, if you're not weak, you don't have to feel any extra stuff.
And I totally agree with him.
Otar Kushanashville
Well, I'm not so naive as to get an amazing response to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are mad, I understand their bread is not eaten. Give it to the enemy.
And even though I wasn't hugging the flag, and the same thing, the same thing, a million times I spoke here, and I didn't call anyone directly, another thing hit me.
All my pseudo-friends are gone in a second.
The press that I'm subject to is so strong that even I, who's been publishing a pair of couples, I think the white people are engaged.
He's been walking, he's walking, and you've been hit by a mob, and you're gonna have to get your hands on it.
But I need to know, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a doll, I'm out of the hood, I'm old, I'm scared.
Another case is no support.
I had no illusion, but now...
I've always had the best self-sufficiency, so enjoy it.
And to give passports to people like Fred Dorst or Monson, they can only be fools.
Better for me, a better journalist, the job is ruined.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili briefly described Crimean events:
What they did with Crimea is crime.
That's what they call "anxiety."
I believe that the reference to how the undergrowth of Croesus has tried to sign something, at any rate does not fit into the general picture of the human community.
It's like coming to the neighbor and taking his place...
The war from Kremlin has gone, and it's just going to end there.
I'm almost 100% sure that, like in the summer of 2008, she started calling some asshole from the Kremlin lock.
I'm guessing who that could have been...
Cobson's not much of a living.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist, why he needs to heal Putin's hands.
He's losing his apartment?
Well, he's got a memory.
Of course, humans have remembered him as an insult to their little family.
And reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirović.
Sunrise 7 is leading a rating despite the Ninth attempt to highlight the losing of the leaders at Today Show
The departure of Carl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson in Canberra to highlight the consequences of the Liberal Party's declaration on the release of the leader's seat failed to raise the rating today.
The morning of the ninth show was broadcast from the capital of the State after Malcolm Ternbull Tony Ebbot.
The competitor, Sunrise, with David Kokh and Samantha Armitage, stopped in London as part of a weekly international news series, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancún.
This torture seemed to have little significance for Australian television operators, while the Sunrise audience had 397,000 spectators in the five largest cities compared to the Today audience in 339,000.
Today has taken a little more than its rating on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has reduced the breakup of the Sunrise in recent months.
In August today, there were 318,000 compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
As of September, the Sunrise has 349 000 viewers against 314,000 at Today.
It's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thank you for your clarification!
Published on Monday, 14 September 2015.
An important news for the Seventh was a stunning debut of 800 Words with a former star series Packed to the Rafters Erik Thompson.
The new drama about the recently widowed father of the family, who decided to move to New Zealand on the coast with their two children, gathered an impressive audience of 1,219 million.
Critics have debated whether Tomson could handle a popular show alone without the star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday's dinner is a loud yes response.
The X Factor of the Seventh remained in strong positions with 1,136 million spectators, easy walking The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For the Seventh, success and failure on the second night of Chase Australia was compounded.
The first half (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new television set by Andrew O'Kifi gathered 446,000 spectators.
The second half (from 17:30 to 18:00) has pushed the figure to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddy McGwar (613 000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of Chase Australia brought together 520,000 spectators, and the second half, a total of 720 000.
Hot Seat's got 620,000.
The fall of Chase Australia's ratings on the second night will make the Ninth quietly admit that the Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that couldn't play MacGwar show.

Three finalists agree that "Holostoyak" Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
The secret's open?
Lana Javan-Fellows, Sarah McKay and Snow Markoske may have been able to figure out which of them won the Holocaust.
The woman with whom Sam Wood will finally stay in Holostayaka is surrounded by the veil of secret.
And the three girls who came to the final are, of course, keeping silent about which one of them got his last pink.
But when we met Sarah McKay, Snow Marksky and Lana Jeeves-Fellows before the day the three girls had to stay two, they might have suddenly given a hint about the winner.
Sam Wood keeps silent until the very final, which will take place on Thursday
All three women come to the lyrical mood, explaining why Wood was the perfect man, who mentioned his feelings of humor, zeal, family values, and joy in life as the reasons why each of them would be happy to be his satellite.
But with their answers to the question, "If not for you, who should get the last rose of Wood?", they could falsely point out which of them really conquered the heart of Holostayak.
Johns-Fellows and Markoski no doubt called Mackey the perfect couple for Wood.
From the first day, Sarah and Shem had a good relationship.
"From the moment I joined the participants, I felt the energy (Sarah) and the energy of Sam and understood that they were very close to each other, and I had no doubt in the whole show," said Javans-Fellows.
"Sara's a very open person, easy and fun with her," said Markoski.
I've seen them together, there's really a bond between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood will get a great couple.
McKay himself said that she realized last week that Wood might be the same person.
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized that it was not just a game -- I trusted him with all my heart," she says.
To whom should Wood be chosen, if it were not for her, she answered emphatically.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls the same way, and Snow and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor's show ends on Wednesday at 19.30 on the Ten Canal.

Jarrid Heen had several options for starting a career in NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in moving him to the United States, as were many other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Haye chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul and apparently it was a wise decision.
Some of the coaches would leave Hayne on the shield for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball, which the former Australian League of Regbie had allowed for the first return of the boy in a winning game with Minnesota with 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his game and gave Hayne another chance to return the panda and put it into the game after Reggie Bush's trauma.
Tomsula showed up on the right side and after the game, in the split.
Instead of making a distinction between the new people in the presence of the team, he got them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at press conferences after the match.
Special Rapporteur of the 49ers Club Kam Inman reported that Hein also received support from the Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and to think about the next game.
Jared Haye lost his ball at the back of the boy by Minnesota Vikings during the first quarter.
At the start of the debut in NHL Hein and his many Australian worshipers were clearly not counting.
It was evident that Hein was crying, leaving the field after the ball was lost, and later he told the leading show "Hamish and Andy" at the Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a more successful start for the NFL career.
"That's what happens, you're just thinking about the next game and everything," said Hean.
Hen compared his career to his debut in the Origin series in 2007, when a ballbroker in his starting zone tried Queensland.
Finally, this experience proved very useful for the 27-year-old toy.
Hen took a photo of the Australian flag and fans after the game and took a picture on Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Michael Hodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat of the use of weapons at the Siberian airport.

The clashes are aimed at strengthening, police are responding to aggressive actions by migrants and their attempts to violate the border.
According to the French-Presse Agency, refugees were able to cross the police border, after which tens of migrants fled to the territory of Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Serbian-Hungarian border on buses heading to Belgrade and the border with Croatia, according to Bi-bi-si.
The country ' s authorities have allowed migrants to come to the Croatian territory and ensure that they are transported from there to the country they need.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, Hungary ' s Parliament strengthened its legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments include the involvement of the army in the protection of the State foreign nationals, the prosecution of those who illegally cross the border, and the accelerated procedure for examining asylum applications.
The Hungarian court has already recognized one migrant guilty of an illegal crossing of the Hungarian-Serbian border and will therefore be deported and unable to return to Hungary for one year.
The Hungarian Parliament also intends to consider soon the transfer of functions to the Hungarian armed forces to protect the border of the country ' s parliament.
At the end of June, Hungary's authorities began building a border fence of 175 km long on the border with Serbia to prevent the flow of migrants and refugees to the country.
The Russians have recognized the greatest in the U.S. history of cybercrime.
Russian Cypriot Vladimir Drinkman, the largest in U.S. history, admitted to stealing more than 160 million credit cards, reports Reuters.
During the trial in the state court of New Jersey, Drinkman agreed to have unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russians spoke with three Russians and Ukrainian citizens accused of cyberattacks of 15 companies.
The total damage to the accused was estimated at $300 million.
"Responsors such as Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to break our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security," said U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman.
Drunkman is in danger of 30 years of imprisonment, as well as a million-dollar fine.
In the case of a sentence, the court shall take into account the recognition of rosian and may reduce the time limit for it.
Drinkman's sentence will be announced on 15 January.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
Then another suspect Dmitry Smiljanec was arrested.
His last guilt in the crimes he committed was denied.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk, supported by Russia's Bashar Assad regime.
During a telephone conversation with the head of Russian media, Sergei Lavor, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia's support for Syrian President Bashar Assad was exacerbating the country's conflict.
"Secretary Kerry suggested that Russia's support for President Asada would be at risk of exacerbating and increasing the conflict, as well as defeating our common goal of combating extremism if we did not focus on finding solutions to the conflict in Syria by means of an effective political transition," said a communication published on the website of the United States Department of Justice.
Kerry reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to combating the Islamic State group (prohibited in Russia by the Supreme Court) of a coalition of more than 60 States.
According to the Secretary-General, Assad "will never be a reliable member" of the coalition.
During the telephone conversation, Kerry also stressed that the conflict in Syria could be resolved only by political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened by isolation in support of the Assad regime.
Recently, the White House Press Secretary Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation if it did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed to join the international coalition, which is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
In recent times, the media have often reported the presence of Russian soldiers in Syria.
The head of Russian IID Sergei Lavrov stated that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and have helped the Syrians to seize the technique to apply it against the Islamics.
Four were killed when the police fired a rifle with resonance bullets on the protests in Nepal.
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when the police launched a raid on the mob, protesting against the proposed new Constitution, as the official representative said on Wednesday.
Violence took place on Tuesday evening in Rupandea County, some 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital of the country.
The head of the district police reported that more than 1,000 protestors had gathered at one of the police stations, some had thrown stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal reported that the police had used tear gas, and then fired in the air before the jets were released.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, he said.
It is not clear why cutting bullets, which are known to be killed but which are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such high mortality.
This clash was the last few weeks of severe protests in southern, even part of Nepal, where representatives of the people of the Madesi state that new provinces formed under the new Constitution would reduce their political influence.
Protests also took place in the west of Nepal, among the Taru people who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, were killed in violent clashes, starting with 10
August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into a province, which had become a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which had been centrally governed for several centuries.
Work on the new Constitution has been under way since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
The legislators voted for the articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said that the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Siansk plans to set up a company in 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk area.
It was built in the 70th century as a center of the chemical industry, with developed infrastructure requiring system support.
A year ago, Zionsk led a new mayor, Oleg Borovski.
On the outcome of the first year of work, he told the Correspondent of the Area.
Oleg Valeriević, why did you start working as a mayor?
First of all, I have been familiar with the results of audits of financial and household activities, initiated an independent audit expert on local budget expenditures.
An audit of municipal property was then carried out.
One of the first practical steps has been to reduce document trafficking to five days.
Previously, the department papers could have walked for months.
Income-based and cost-optimization activities have been developed.
In November last year, a visit to the Government was held in Sayansk, where issues of the socio-economic development of the Territory were discussed.
There was no project documentation (PSD) in the city for any object.
Without that, Ciyansk could not participate in federal programmes.
We started preparing PSDs on the roads, a children's garden, a north sewer and a water supply.
Road work in two areas is now under way.
How is the order of the President of the RF on the construction of children's gardens implemented in the city?
In July this year, 105 children were born in Sayanska.
There was no such positive demographic in the city for the past 27 years.
So the issue of safe places in children's gardens is one of the most relevant today.
Since 1 September, children's No. 10 capital has been refurbished, with 320 seats.
The estimated value of the repair is 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such funds before.
Last year, after the repair, a children's garden No. 23 was opened, which is now visiting 200 children.
The refurbishment was made in terms of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, worth more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and assistance of the district government, funds for the purchase of furniture and equipment have been sought, and the National Initiatives programme has also helped.
There are plans to start building a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the order of children between the ages of half and three years.
We don't have three to seven-year-olds.
Are investors interested in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city must be done, first and foremost, by the Chinese companies, that they need to be provided with work.
In October, a 60-quarter house for orphans in the Leningrad microregion is being put into service.
As far as construction is concerned, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangaria, which is part of the economic housing programme.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 block sections will begin soon.
We have all declared the construction of 10,000 sqm of those who wish to participate in the programme very much.
One of the conditions is that the apartment should not be worth 30,000 rubles per square meter, which is the "under key" section.
If we deal with the required levels, we will continue to participate in the programme.
With regard to investors, we have other interesting projects.
In time, the Sayan pig complex was built in the territory, which was sold at no cost in 2004.
We're working with the prosecutor's office to defend this deal.
The more land under the facility, the more federal property.
Working with Moscow, the issue of the transfer of 88 g to district property, with the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor who is willing to invest in reconstruction and launch a 1.5 billion rubles project.
With a pig gun, we're going to have 900 jobs, which will be a big support for the city.
Will the Institute of Social Partnership be developed in China?
We have about 140 treaties in the socio-economic partnership.
No projects have been implemented through the active social position of business representatives.
Efficient support is provided by companies such as East-Center, New Zealand TEC, Sayanski Broiler, MDF PEC, which are responsible for the management of these enterprises.
Directly to the day of the city of OOO, the Sayanski Broiler gave the city a children's town, the East-Center company has repaired a horse court where professionals are dealing with children with illatherapy, with more than 1 million rubles.
The sponsors helped to revitalize the territory of the city of ZAGSA.
The sponsors helped to note the city’s Day in a beautiful way.
As in old times, a parade was held with the participation of urban communities and organizations.
The city’s capital, the book of Zion’s poets, was released.
The first builders and people who have made a significant contribution to the development of the Sayanska have been awarded the medals.
Mezenatas also participate in the urban charity fund.
The first step was to acquire tools for young talented musicians.
Over nine months, more than 800 thousand rubles have been directed to support talented children, to support children in need of expensive treatment, and to support children from disadvantaged families.
How are the personnel problems in the social sphere addressed in the Saiyan region?
There's not enough doctors and educators in the city.
The provision of housing professionals is of great importance in addressing the staff issue.
Over the past year, we had five doctors ’ rooms, and we had four teachers.
We have a housing program to privatize it in five years.
Plans include replanning the building, which will build another eight accommodation for teachers.
Teachers and doctors are also involved in the program "The Year for the Russian Family".
In the future, the construction of a house for budget workers.
Most importantly, there is a working team in the city that I can deal with most complex issues.
It is important to make the right conclusions from all the crises, but life will not stop.
The potential for China and our region is great.
The Duma introduced a draft law on the indexation of sophistications, taking into account price increases.
The Government has introduced a bill that provides for the indexation of social pensions on 1 February each year, taking into account price increases.
The author of the document, a member of the Fair Russia, Alexander Lomakin-Romans, also proposes to conduct an additional pension index on 1 April, if the rate of growth of the living minimum exceeds the rate of increase in prices for goods and services.
The index of savings under the existing legislation is made annually as of 1 April, taking into account the rate of growth of the pensioner ' s minimum living in the FF last year.
The draft law introduced in the lower Chamber provides for the introduction of a social pension index, taking into account the rate of growth in consumer prices.
The first index is carried out on 1 February and the second is carried out on 1 April.
The OSCE head declared Mogerini ' s inadmissibility to introducing sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs, Federica Mogerini, spokesperson for PA OSCE, Ilkka Kanerva, stated that sanctions against legislators participating in the assembly activities were unacceptable.
A member of the Russian delegation informed the reporters about this at the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulan-Batore Nikolai Kovalev.
According to the TACS, signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus and Greece, have been collected in support of the position of the Cannes.
"There's already been enough support," Kovalev said.
Earlier, he stated that the OSCE Head of the PA spoke with a view to collecting the signatures of the MPs, which indicated that sanctions against parliamentarians were not allowed.
In particular, he noted Kovalev, the Cannerva promised to raise this issue at the level of the European Union guidelines and to “request”.
NHC reports that the probability of cyclone south of the Green Island is 60 per cent
The wide front of the low pressure area is approximately 350 miles (560 km) south of the island's southern edge of the Green Mesa, 60 per cent of the turn into a tropical cycle over the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Centre reported on Tuesday.
Another clearly identified low pressure area in the middle of the Green Island and the Small Antilles also has a 60 per cent probability of developing a tropical cyclone in the next two days, reports the synaptics from Miami.
Google launches a double-rate campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the start of a double campaign to collect $11 million for humanitarian organizations to assist the neighbouring European countries of refugees who are fleeing from torn-off and depleted countries.
Google has used a non-character personal approach by advertising a campaign to collect donations on its blog.
Instead of making a statement by one of the leaders, Google Rita Masudou, who was running with a family from Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We went on suspicious trains and buses, endured hunger, thirst, hunger and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has intensified, many people, such as my family, desperately need help.
Contributions will be made to four non-commercial organizations assisting refugees and migrants: “Doctors without borders”, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would double the first $5.5 million of donations until the amount on google.com/refugeerelief was 11 million.
Europe is facing the strongest refugee crisis since the Second World War, caused by more than four years of civil war in Syria, resulting in more than 4 million people moving this year.
Many are also fleeing the wars of Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics with minor obesity may help with obesity surgery
The beneficial effect of post-inflammatory surgery in people with low-inflammatory type 2 diabetes may last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still early to claim that low-ingestion diabetics live longer after obesity than those receiving non-surgical treatment.
"The mortality statistics are not at all immediate," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a nursing surgeon who wrote about a new study in the column of editor JAMA Surgery.
Diarrhoea surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses different methods to reduce stomach size.
They reduce hunger and limit the ability of organisms to consume food.
In a few years, bariatric surgery has proved its effectiveness in treating type 2 diabetes, but major studies have been carried out among people with morphine ingestion with the body mass index (IMT) 35 or above.
IMT, the measure of weight relative to growth, is considered normal from 18.5 to 24.9.
IMT 25 or above says that man has an excessive weight and people with IMT over 30 are considered to be obese.
You can calculate your IM here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers from the Taiwanese Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007, to compare two types of bariatric surgery - breast-feeding and hand-held gastrectomy, with type 2 diabetes treatment in people with mild obesity.
The mean value of IMT for those undergoing surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, IMT remains at approximately 29 levels for those who have received non-surgical treatment from diabetes.
Among those who had undergone surgery, 36% had been completely cured of diabetes and, in part, 28% had been treated.
In the drug treatment group, the total treatment of diabetes was only 1%, and the partial treatment was only about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and the “bad” LPNP cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group”, the authors say.
Researchers also controlled levels of hemoglobin A1s in blood that reflect blood sugar levels in dynamics.
Gemoglobin A1c is better kept below 7%, according to researchers.
Following surgery, the mean haemoglobin of A1c decreased from approximately 9 per cent to approximately 6 per cent.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, approximately 8 per cent.
But better glycaemic control rates, as reflected by good levels of hemoglobin A1c, did not reduce mortality in five years, according to Dr. Chi Cheng Su and colleagues.
The study group also compared the mean results of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, compared with the group filling the manual gastrectomy, the sintering group lost more weight (18.7 kg versus 14.2 kg), achieved a higher reduction in IMT (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1s (3.1% versus 2.1%), and was closer to the full remission of diabetes (46.9% versus 16.7%).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of the surgical method in part of life after five years, there is evidence of the results of the study of people with excess body mass in Sweden that surgical treatment actually leads to an increase in life expectancy, according to Blackstone of the College of Medicine at the University of Arizona, Phoenix.
According to the Swedish study for people with obesity who chose bariatric intervention, the probability of dying for 15 years was approximately 29 per cent lower than that of a group with more traditional methods.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that it encouraged people with ICT below 35 interested in this procedure.
“The report is very important here, as it claims that such a surgical intervention is safe in a low-IMT group where there is no increased risk of mortality or early diseases,” she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the IMT reaches the range between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to make people take this seriously," she said.
It seems to me that once they are able to absorb the genetic changes that are starting in their bodies of obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to bring it back.
In Mityta the robbers were taken out of the shed house and 9 million rubles.
In Miti, the kidnappers attacked the inhabitants of the sub - forest house and stole 9 million rubles and three women’s shoes.
It informs the Interfax with a reference to the IMF press service.
The incident happened Tuesday morning.
Two unknowns through the open entrance came into the house on the street of Goriko, tied the 20-year-old homeowner and, threatening both knives, kidnapped 9 million rubles and three holes.
According to the preliminary data, the amount of damage was 9 million 265,000 rubles, a criminal case under the heading “Razbius”.
Europe’s fans are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 peterburg hotels have the right to accommodate tourists who will come to the world football championship in 2018.
The rest of the hotel is not in a hurry to obtain the appropriate permission.
In the opinion of experts, this is a very alarming sign.
Before the world premiere, the authorities will have to think about how to disembark all the guests of the city.
The Rosbalt interviewers believe that the rental price of the pooled apartments will increase by 10-30 per cent because of the tournament, and after the ground floor champ will have to be paid over.
The World Football Championship had the authorities draw attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to the law written especially in advance, each hotel in Petersburg must undergo a classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the claimed number of stars and level of service.
Now it is clear that this will not be done by all: the buyers are so afraid of checks that they often do not even send documents to requests from the Federal Antitrust Service in Petersburg.
According to UFAS head of Vadim Vladimirov, the department has studied 138 residents and is now planning to conduct 34 hotel cases, many of which simply did not respond to antimony users.
There are indications that the three dozen companies' management has been misleading by placing some number of stars in the advertising industry, Vladimir said.
The problem is that now, literally, no number can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship, all peterburg hotels will be held by the sick.
Now in the city of tourists can count 30.5,000 numbers.
According to Smolno, in Petersburg, 17 five-star hosts, 51 four-star hotel, 100-two-and-three-star, 550-one-star.
According to the first Subsidiary Committee on Tourism Development Nana Gvičia, only 23 hotels have been classified to date - so many inspections have been carried out by accredited companies in Petersburg.
And this is whether any hotel has ordered such a procedure in regional enterprises, which is not known to the Small after a surprising recovery.
That is, there may be more than one classification, but no one knows about it.
"The last half of the hotels did not very much seek to be classified," said Ekaterin Shadsky, director of the North-West Office of the Russian Union.
This is explained by the high season during which buyers make the most of their money and do not want to do other business.
Another reason is that there were no budgets for verifications, and the procedure could cover the hotel, depending on the status of 30 to 100 thousand rubles and more.
However, hotel managers have recently stepped up and began to apply for classification, Shadskja said.
The hotel has to be successful by 1 July 2016, otherwise it will not only pay the fine but will not yet be allowed to work on the world championship.
It is already known that, depending on the star, a fixed fee will be made for the hotel's number at the time of the tournament.
The formula for calculating the value will be published next year.
This was done in order not to allow prices to rise by 200-300 per cent, as is the case during the Petersburg Economic Forum.
We need to have a conscience and not be allowed to grow twice or three times, but we also need to let the hotel earn.
"I think growth will be up to 50%," explained the President of the Russian Hospitality Association Gennadi Lamshin.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not convinced that price fixing is consistent with market economy.
I don't know how much this goes into economic theory, but I hope this measure is justified.
"It's a better unbearable trip," he said.
It's not clear what's going to be with popular cheap hotels.
The Members of the House introduced a bill that the houses should be banned in the homes.
We hope that this law will not be adopted or will not apply to Petersburg.
"We will resist the view that the hotels must be preserved," says Nana Gwachi.
However, she said that the miners should be prepared to strengthen the Civil Code in any case.
If the House still approves the bill, about 80 per cent of the hotels will be closed in Petersburg, and at this point there are 1.5 thousand rooms.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurants and Otelers of the North-West of Leonida Garbar, there are no two-and-a-three-star residents in Petersburg who have been excavated by foot-and-mouth disease, as there are four-and-five-star crossings on the side of the hotel.
This is the situation similar to the situation where "at the 80-month-old stadium there are 75 thousand nuns."
This can be corrected as a matter of fact.
Their possible prohibition is "idiotism," "I think it's strange that some people can live in the rooms, and that's why they can't come."
If the hotel is used as a residence, I agree it's wrong.
But if the hotel where the guests arrive for a short time, why not?
The mini-hospitals are at risk of missing the World Cup on football and their failure.
Hundreds of small expatriates simply fail to pass the classification, and it is self-conceived.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be booked.
“The companies that can conduct this procedure are not so much, so they will reject less paid orders from the mini-hotels and choose those who travel,” noted Gennadia Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the indicators of the checks that have been carried out so far are significantly higher than the peterburgs.
The cause of the Petersburg delay is related to permanent interruptions in the Government ' s tourist block, which does not contribute to a concerted effort.
In the opinion of experts, if peterburgers are not all enough, it is likely that they will have to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
According to the 300-year celebration of Petersburg in the city, the river fleet can be mobilized, which means guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many patients will be prepared to come to the vehicles at which they will be able to stay overnight.
"The main thing is not to set up so many hotels that they will then be deserted," is sure Gennadi Lamshin.
A large popularity during the football championship will also be used as a collective home.
They'll probably create a pool of joint apartments in the city.
Rent rates increase by 10-30 per cent.
"From the obvious - the first will be the accommodation near the stadium," said a rental expert of the Agency for Development and Research in Larissa Bragina's real estate.
The rental price may not return to the former level after the championship, especially in sleeping areas.
This will also contribute to the construction of new transport facilities on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
It is worth noting the human qualities of the citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is sure that Petersburg has always been a hospitable city where people not only point the way, but can also take a mini-excursion.
There are difficulties.
In 1970 my father met a family from Murmansk, a father, a mother, and two children in the court.
They found it difficult to sleep in the car with the guests at the time.
"And Dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," recalled the interviewer.
True, he added that there was no such thing in the city’s inhabitants now - to call the house the consequences and the horrors.
But might in 2018, following the failure of the House, the error of the hotelers and the governments have to be remembered?
Girinov's "silt" in the Amur area.
He looked with admiration at the Girinowski Club in Gosduma today.
He did such things when our generation had just learned to trade in newspapers, and still is in a beautiful form.
The theme of the statement is, of course, "the LDPR protest against the outcome of the Amurian elections".
Protocols are not trimmed; there are no other protocols, except those signed by the electorate, in the LDPR, according to all.
He raised John Abram's second place, and he cried out, "Here is the winner of the election!"
And here's what goes on in Rodney, and then, after the collapse with the chairman, he introduces a faction from the meeting room, literally saying, "You're all with the fronts of your jugs and holes."
The press, of course, focuses, not on Abramov, but on scandal and demarche factions as a result of this scandal and insult.
It was really Wolfović that brought the Amur area along with Abraham.
For the whole of the country, this is the regular outcome of the Girinovski in the style of "Sondonky!" and is not a protest against the political party against the results of the specific elections.
And the fact that the fact that the party and the Facebook page of Ivan Abramov are not recognized by the fact that the leader of the topic is obviously going down.
It provides the dead in the Amur to protect their dead themselves, and it itself blesses the "One Russia" in general and in anything not to be required by the Rodney.
It's a good decision not to lose a person, not to go to the present, but to show a scandal.
Another case that Abraham himself is now in a strange situation.
In addition to the tension from the headquarters, he expected nothing, no alternative protocols on his hands.
He was not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but on the other, for the narrow circle, he was a formal cause and a insult to the respected champion, and, more than that, he was a homicidal victim to the ER and the NF.
And here, of course, he has to think seriously about what to do.
Because from the main voter, the policy number 2 of the region and candidate number 1 could become the only district one-mandated district, which had been successfully used by its own party leadership and super-smooth leader for the same IMF and the foreign party leadership.
That's right, it wouldn't be Girinowski, it should be thought about, and it should be looked after.
It's still growing and growing.
There was news that LDPR would return to the hall during the next plenary session.
That's the bathroom's got nothing to do with it.
Only the subject of Abram's funeral.
Beautiful indeed.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the cessation of violence in refugee countries.
Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in her speech to the opening of the Dalai Lama Consistency Centre in Oxford on ethics studies at the beginning of her 10-day visit to Britain.
He stated that in the current circumstances, the interests of humanity should be above the interests of individual countries or even of continents.
He also stressed that, although this is an admiral, the Western European response to the refugee crisis is not an adequate situation.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said.
Although Dalai Lama had responded strongly to the action taken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"The entertainment of thousands of refugees is wonderful, but at the same time you must think about long-term solutions to bring about the present world and the present development, mainly through education, into these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we must consider how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We need to weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Speaking of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George Bush following terrorist acts 9/11, stating that the United States had a severe reaction to uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the problem could be resolved through non-violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he used force, and that led to unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have swallowed the hand disinfectant in the last 4 years
Toxicological centres in the United States reported an almost 400 per cent increase, starting in 2010, the number of children under 12 years of age who swallowed a high - alcohol disinfectant, as reported by Georgia State Toxicological Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the State Toxicology Centre of Georgia, cases of detonation by children under 12 years of age for hand disinfection reported at the toxicology centres increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
“Children are more likely to contact these substances, and, unfortunately, some of them are sent to the emergency room,” said Lopes CNN.
He said that some children drink defiling fluids especially, and some do so to impress their friends or to argue about social networks.
Youtube videos show that teenagers drink disinfectant fluid as a cheap drink.
Adolescents are reported to have mixed disinfectant fluid with alcohol-containing fluid to soften the mouth to obtain stronger drink.
Younger children can attract pleasant tastes of disinfectant fluid.
"The kid doesn't think it could hurt him," said Lopez.
Many of the most attractive (defecting liquids for hands) are those that are flavoured.
There are disinfecting fluids for the hands with smell of clubs, vineyards, and oranges that are very attractive for children.
Disinfective fluids for the hands contain somewhere from 45 to 95 per cent of alcohol.
Young children, in particular, may experience a number of complications that may lead to alcohol poisoning.
"This is a high-concentration spirit," said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Steven Thornton, chief doctor of the toxicology center at the University of Kansas.
You wouldn't just leave a bottle of whiskey, but people keep in mind these hand disinfectants, and if children get to them, it's a quick way to use a lot of alcohol.
Najija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a hand disinfectant with a club aroma in about four spreads, was sent to treatment in the emergency room.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice as high as that of an adult who was considered under the law to be under alcohol abuse, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, a emergency medical doctor who treated her at the Guinnett Medical Centre near Atlanta.
Najija broke up and couldn't walk when she was delivered to the emergency room.
Doctors observed her all night at a separate child hospital to avoid missing any signs of brain trauma, because the girl fell down and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchie told me.
"It was very scary," said CNN Orttoria Scott, mother of Najiji.
This could have been fatal for my child.
Lopes recommended that parents and teachers use non-spiring substances or disinfectants, in addition to removing defiling fluids from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants link to deaths.
Two women from Ontario died in 2013, after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, not ethyl alcohol, which was indicated as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-class students in the North of New York agreed to poison their “opposite” teacher by “dissemination of antibacterials in class”, according to the police report.
The teacher had a strong allergy to hand disinfectants, and she had forbidden them to be held in her class.
The police believe that the final plan was "empty conversation" and addressed the discipline of the school district.
As the oldest children’s library in Barnaule became a family club.
At the back of the rocking at the entrance to the N.K. Kruppsky Children's Library, a strange owl.
The kids who come after the books are trying to feed her with confetti.
Several generations have been walking in this library for 95 years.
The first readers of the 20th century set up loud readings here, placed shows on the texts of Mayakovsky, held literary books, and copied with Lenin’s wife.
The census continued for four years, and, as reported in 1939, the newspaper Juni Stolinec, with every day the "friendship between Hope of Constantinople Krup and friends of the Barnaul Children's Library" became ever stronger.
Hope Constantinople even sent her children's pictures to distant Barnaul friends one day.
And when the bartenders asked if Hope Constantinople objected to the library's name, she wrote no, no, no.
The writings are long washed in the museum, and the grandchildren and lawyers of the first readers have to explain the hard profile of the barbershop in the library building.
In the years that changed, people were often upset: Why is the children’s library not renamed?
Let the library be the name of some good child writer without a political spell!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it was.
"Crup's" is, please, the most famous and favorite library in Barnau, as a "line" in Moscow.
On the field in the library weaving is a yellow - brick road.
"Vollector of the Amazing City" is the favorite theme of the artist Olli Moscow.
Previously, Ola was a manager of a legal company, had come to work at eight, had gone to five, and all the other managers were distinguished only by love of painting.
And then she found an Internet announcement, "It takes an illustrator for a book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and she was called My Cancer Mommy, "My Mother's Cancer."
Oil made an illustration, and thought, "Life can end at any time, and there will be no miracles in it unless you create them yourself."
She now works in the library, pictures the children’s books of writers from all over the world, and she makes stories herself.
Traditionally, children are losing interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some virtual space...
But we have kids reading, and their parents understand the importance of reading, says the director of the Russian Planet, Tatyana Kuschvid Library.
In recent years, we've even had a moment of confidence that the children's library needs, and she's going to live -- kids are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
The library’s website features a large exhibition with an updated photo exhibition.
New photos of readers who go to the library of the whole family — Mom, Dad, and children — are featured in the neighborhood.
The library rejoices that the popes have become increasingly popular with the children.
If a child is two years old, he needs more books when he is older.
But now there is a law that prohibits eight-year-olds from issuing books of category 12+.
To obtain such a book, a child must bring his parents with him, they come back, and gradually "Krupski" becomes a kind of family club for them.
In the library there are treasures - a dorevolutionist collection of caves and eras, to bring the Queen in the annex to the magazine "Niva", the "Murzilki" for 1936.
Now we're not just the conceptual space of the temple of books, we're now open to movement, we're trying to be a special place: not home, not work, not school, - explains Tatyana Kuschvid.
We can come here to read, play, paint together.
We've made a play area for the kid-- the kid just comes to play, and the arm still hangs on to the book!
Some of our readers are wearing their parents, and they support their feet, and they don't want to leave.
Moms often come with wheels - and we are pleased that they put the library first among all the other places where children should come.
Tatiana Kuschvid says: Modern children like us sometimes love classical children's literature:
"The case of extradition is now developing, and much attention is being paid to the authors who are the linkages between generations."
And if you're talking about little kids, it's important for them to be a hero who travels from one book to another.
Children don't like to be separated by their heroes.
The library keeps publishing booklets for parents, telling them what is happening in the modern literature of children, which books should be considered and why.
The booklets are so interesting and interesting that adults are interested, but this library is not for them at all.
It is forbidden to produce books outside the reading hall for adults.
This magical privilege has only children.
In the nearest library room, there's a square corner of the old wooden ladder in the basement, in the library.
Steps will slip under your steps - it's a very old time machine.
You meet with your childhood book like an old friend: Hi, it's good that you and I don't change.
Ellie's still walking along the road with a yellow rag, the Tol Rzyzyk belt is stealing the witch's head, and Malchis Kibalchis did not say the damn castles of the Military Secret, that's what he's saying.
Such books are like passwords, and they can be found anywhere.
There are books in the warehouse and these are rare - for example, the Dorevolution collection was with the caves and eras.
Or bring the Queen in a famous annex to the magazine "Niva".
Or "Murzylkie" for 1936.
It was time for the pages to be old, and they were decorated with tea.
These publications are no longer published to readers.
It's our future collection, and I'm dreaming I'm going to retire, and I'm going to do rare children's books.
But the kids are not going to do it, and the old books aren't very bright, and the themes... you're opening the first page, and there's Lenin, the party, the comsomol.
Now it seems, why did we all write this "Pioner Truth"?
But it was interesting anyway, says Galina Ilásov, a bookstore.
The Mursilki pages have been faded from time to time.
Galina Vasilevna will spend her entire life in the library.
She knows what color the bouratino doll is, in what year of training Harry Potter became captain of Griffindor's team at the Quiddi Championship, in which Carlson uses a motorbike, and who works as father of Alice Selènevoy.
The librarians pay little for their work, and anyone who can live without these book series is quick to find another profession.
Only the most convinced are the educators, the teachers, the ministers of the worship of the book.
They can also be found in smiles - it's thought to be a professional drawing of a children's library.
If he smiles at you in the first minute of the conversation, he's a professional.
I love children's books as much as I like to be a librarian so they can be straight and beautiful on the shelf, and I still love to read them, says Galina Vasilievna.
I read everything: military, historical behaviors, stories, fantasy.
Reading modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think in my childhood everything was different.
The books were the most interesting and fascinating of all that happened to me at the time.
And since I was foolishly in love with them, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be, despite the knights.
And I'm glad that our ex-readers are bringing children, and the grandchildren...
Hearing mill: There's no difference in "Seltice"
Griffiths denied the debate on the disputes in Celtic after Dale's admission that Hopes was in a bad situation, but he'll fix it.
Harts will protest the Scottish Football Association's claim to Nelson, and Worberton is afraid of signing contracts in January that might violate the team's unity.
Dons have increased the advantage over Seltic to five points.
The Adam Runi Penalties in the first time gave Aberdina a little advantage over Hamilton in Pittodrey, allowing Dons to get rid of Seltika for five points.
Griffiths rejected the debate on disputes
This led to the rumors of the "Seltika" disagreements, which were cut off by Griffiths, claiming that he and his team members were not suffering from any more intense criticism of the Dutch League leaders.
I don't think we're feeling the tension, I think the games are looking for him.
The Dutch are bored because the Scottish are not fighting for the title - de Bur
The former Rangers semi-trailer and former Dutch member Ronald de Bur said that Dutch football patients lost interest in Seltika because he did not meet with Rangers.
De Bur, currently a representative of Ayaxa, said: "In the Netherlands, the most attractive moments of the Celtic game no longer show," and why?"
It's because there's no Rangers.
People here are not just talking about the Rangers return.
They're talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
In the old firm's games, there's a lot of tension, and not only do people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," said Dale
Ronnie Dale admitted that "Seltic" is in trouble, but the Norwegian coach has sworn to change everything.
As a result of Malmo's defeat and as a result, the League of Champions has soon followed 10 Aberdina footballers, who are now on top of a five-point table.
However, Dale said, "The "Selitek" had bad times and before, and we'll be out again."
Now we want to get out of this as quickly as possible.
I understand it's very boring, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's happening.
And so do we, but we have to keep going.
And we really need Seltika's support, because this is getting a lot better.
It's so important to stay together right now.
Warberton looks forward to January transfers
Despite the views that had appeared a couple of weeks ago that he had identified some of the targets of January transfers, the Rangers boss Mark Worberton was reluctantly referring to the January campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy the unity of the team.
The former attacker, Brentford, said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
With regard to the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the start of the season for their adaptation, which you have seen in our own group during the season.
The team's working really well.
Sometimes more harm comes from adding unnecessary toys to what you really need.
Michu, interested in "Seltic", decided to complete his career
The attacker Suansi Mitch, connected to Seltik during the transfer window, concluded that he could leave football after his contract with Lebedes ended.
A 29-year-old toy had been in trouble with the boat for two years, and he couldn't leave Wales this summer.
Harts is going to oppose SFA's statements on Nelson's
"Harts" said in account 2:1 when they removed Patterson, and began to play 3:2, but the red card of the defender was later cancelled; it was the third red card of Colum, cancelled in eight months.
Nelson doesn't give up saying, "I didn't question ethics, I didn't comment on the game."
Griffiths swore to avoid Tinkasl
The Haibernian team's direct play was given an excuse after admitting that he sang a song with insults about the former Harts-Scathell player.
The incident occurred in a pub in Roseburn district in Edinburgh before the beginning of the Edinburgh Derby in Tinkasle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was a burning one," said the attacker, adding, "I can't say for sure that I wasn't going back to Thankasl if he wasn't playing for "Seltic."
Donnelly: Tannadis Council Trusted in Dandy United Management
Simon Donnelly argues that the Board of Directors of Dandi United remains convinced that the management team will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the deterioration in the field should end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the guys ready to go out again," said Donnelly.
Makinnes is glad he won the "unprecedented" in Hamilton.
Derek McKinness admitted that his team "Aberdin" had had to fight desperately against "Hamilton Assis" to win the seventh victory in the lead of the League, which put them at five points above "Seltika", on top of the tournament table, thanks to the Adam Runi Penalties in the first time.
McInness said, "There's no team here that would win something like a doll or a league champion who didn't win a meeting like that."
The unemployment rate among Scottishs is not changing, while in the United Kingdom it is growing
BEZABOTIA remained at 164,000 in Scotland for the period from May to July, while the total number of unemployed in the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million for the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was higher in the United Kingdom at 5.5 per cent, as shown by the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with the number of workers now being 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland was down to 74.0 per cent, which is above the average of 73.5 per cent for the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Minister for Affairs David Mandelle, commenting on the latest figures, noted: “The long-term plan of the Government has laid the foundations for strengthening the economy”.
Almost a year has passed since Scotland made the historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
Over the 12 months, we have seen further improvements in Scotland's labour market in terms of employment growth and unemployment reduction.
Why am I a witness of the punishment in Oklahoma?
Today, by avoiding legal interference at a later stage, I will look at how human punishment is being punished.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting on a visual gallery of the death row in Oklahoma State Prison when Richard Glossip will be punished with a lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses of his death.
For the first time this request was made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew near, I became afraid.
So why would you do that?
I agreed, because I thought it was a good way to tell the story of the death penalty.
That would suggest a unique appeal.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend the American executions, and since they want more often than places, the results of the dark lottery decide who will be elected.
In Oklahoma, the number of press posts was reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever's chosen, he'll look at it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I'll be sitting with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and we've had our own relationship with him after a few months of phone calls and one visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so they won't let me take a notebook and a hand to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of being impartial on Twitter.
That's a lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he likes it, he gets access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she could “make it better” herself, but still felt that I was wrong about what I was doing.
Richard Glossip didn't agree with any of what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it, even if he said it.
I told him he could get me out of his witness list at any time.
But he wants the journalist to be present there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that publicity will help to eliminate the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, Haffington Post reporter, will be with me.
If you want to know more about it, listen to the podcasts I wrote.
I'm not going to be here in detail again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is not guilty.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treize make him guilty of a felony.
But I believe there's a great chance that he's not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the death sentence was not enough.
I think his punishment is wrong.
And I'll see him die from this.
I can't claim to be completely objective.
There will be other reporters to address.
From me, you'll know what it's like to see a person I like die without need.
Persecuted by the police ordered to leave the Canning River
Constable from the town of Canning-Weil was able to arrange for a man to leave the Canning River and remain dry.
Perta's resident was planning to leave the police, but he couldn't stop in the dirty water on the mermaid in a few meters from the police officer trying to "make it easy to get on the beach."
The Canning-Weil police were called on Tuesday for illegal entry into another territory in Buckingham.
When the police noticed the suspect, he tried to get away from them by moving to Canning.
But he didn't get far.
"He was standing in the water and saying, "I won't go out, let's go, get me," said Senior Sergeant Chandell Castle.
Constable Laclan Perhavec didn't really want to wet the shape, so he used a safer reception -- "negotiation with a good cop."
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," says Senior Sergeant Kasldain.
That's what the football champion Ben Casinos remembered.
In 2006, Casinos went to the province to avoid meetings with a police patrol to check on alcohol and tried to cross Suon.
His efforts were in vain, but he encouraged locals to invent a funny "Biathlon of Ben Casinos".
Peter Modi accuses the stewards of trying to spy and threatens to get out of horse sport.
Peter Modi accused the drivers of Racing Victoria of trying to put a spy in his cavalry last year and threatened to leave the horse sport immediately.
Its aim was to become the drivers and ethics officers of Racing Victoria, whom he accused of organizing a campaign against him personally, and to withdraw from the start of Lady Tatai because of a violation of the drug regulations on the day of the launch, on Wednesday, it became the last slump.
Modi reported to Fairfax Media that he always applied all the efforts in jumping, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of the Leader's attempt to cobalt, which he could not explain.
He kept his tongue on the suspicion of spying for half a year and did not want it to "seem like a green vineyard."
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've been for a long time, but sometimes it's getting you so out of the way that you're not holding back," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I'm gonna have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to have a good night's sleep.
I want to walk with a high-headed head and I want my owners to know that I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start to think it's not, then I'm gonna have to stop being a coach.
Then I have to think about what to do with my license.
Earlier Moody made a sensational statement during an interview at racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy on his horse.
"Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stuart lived in a room with a man I'll call, if they ask, and offered him a job in my cavalry to pass on information about what I'm doing in my stable," Modi said at Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a liar.
If so, they should all make statements because they failed to understand me.
Robert Rollston, former president of RVL, David Mudi, current president of RVL, and Bernard Sandory, current executive director of RVL, have known about this all the time and they know it now.
Shouldn't that make me think it's getting personal?
Shouldn't RVL be bold and call for an answer to what is going on in this business, other people besides coaches?
Am I worse for this profession?
Am I bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think it's true.
Maybe they should get me a license and push me away, and I don't doubt that what I'm saying right now might make them think about it.
But I just got to the point where I don't care, and it's gonna hurt me.
I'm really sorry about that.
I will put pressure on them and place their responsibility on them for decision-making.
I have support from the family, and I can leave.
The coach only grew up in a long investigation with a cobalt and a leader, and the last removal of the horse from the start made him claim that he could "put his license on the table".
Modi, the most famous of the preparations for the invincible Black Caviar champ, called for medical preparations to be used on the day of the “smiling” competitions after the horse’s legs were pressed out of clay, which was a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules on jumps.
"I must bear the full responsibility for this," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly made her a leg-press.
She could've gotten a compress last night.
She could have gotten it yesterday, just like it was.
She was with him the day he ran.
Wises may be disqualified for three months under the regulations on the use of medicinal products on the day of the compression contest, in which case the squads opened the investigation.
It's anecdotes.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but it's gone too far," Mudi said.
A driver who is on a train and hiding from the scene in Cobra, arrested
The police arrested a man who took a motorcyclist out in Cobra and hid himself from the scene.
Motorcyclists took him to a helicopter at Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car at Murrey Welly Hayway on Saturday morning.
The police said that the driver had left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of the city of Natalie surrendered to the police in Shepporton.
It is expected that he will be charged with leaving the scene of the accident, with no assistance, and with other traffic regulations.
A motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Kobrama, remains in a stable hospital.
Trainer Melbourne Storm Craig Bellami charges of rivals in the use of harsh forces
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellami called the criticism of the capture of his team's ball as "adjournment of the agenda" by two favorite NRL champions.
Coach Sidney Rusters Trent Robinson said the judges allowed Storm to "fight" with his team during a sudden Storm victory at the final qualifying game in Sydney on Friday evening.
Coach Brisbane Broncos, Wayne Bennet made a show of Storm after his team won the final qualification tournament at Nosern Queensland Kauboz on Saturday night, when he called this game "typical" for a team of regiments and said that two of the Queensland teams were not "too successful" in hand-held understanding.
Bellamy protected the capture of the ball by his team and said that they were just focused on "contacts", taking the ball.
Bellami added that he was convinced that his team had been criticised by two leading coaches, because that means that they were concerned about the possible defeat of Storm.
"It's still coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about the harsh receptions when they played us with the 24nd account," Bellam said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we haven't changed anything in our systems or protection techniques all year long, just in the last six weeks, we've been paying special attention to the contact with the ball, which has become a turning point for us.
It's been there for three years, and he's obviously training a great team, so he's probably not used to playing, and it's been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how it always turns out at this time of year.
Bellami argued with Bennett's idea of "impressive football", reminding his teacher that "St. George-Illavar Dregons" Bennett won the 2010 championship, showing a "hard" football.
Wayne's talking about winning football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night, and see how impressive their game was," Bellami noted.
I remember that in 2010 St. George was very critical, calling a boring team, and Wayne said it would never bother him.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks is impressive football, especially his young half-guards at their speed.
It's a football that you'd like to play when you've got these games.
He made this comment in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style -- not every team has two half-guards like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like that.
This gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried about us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they got to big games.
Bellami also noted that the Storm and Rusters game was a competition with a large number of points than the Broncos and the Cabowices game.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game he was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what is that impressive football?
Or do you consider it an impressive break and unsuccessful attempt?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, that means that at some point we can meet them there.
In Storm at the end of the weekend, as they won the right to take either North Queensland Caboys or the Crown Sharks on the next Saturday evening at the preliminary final at AAMI Park, the tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
The Serbian drug-deposited has been released for $20,000
A man who was threatened by a life sentence for attempting to allocate 40 kg of cocaine delivered to Queensland by smuggling had been released for 200,000 dollars.
Marco Maximovic, 29 years old, was one of five people arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on the Solay yacht from South America through Vanuatu and landed in Kumer in August.
During the whole morning, Maximovic and his associates saw him at the docks, and later he met them at Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kg of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Although Maximovicu is in danger of living for an attempt to place drugs in sufficient quantity for sale, lawyer Maximovica claims that there is no evidence that the last attempt was made to get the whole party, and that the man could be in coffee without any thought.
The Supreme Court judge Peter Flenagan doubted that Maximovic should have been released.
The latter has relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his location.
The mother and stepfather Maximovic was invited to make a joint deposit of $200,000 for his release.
“The testimony both makes it clear that the amount of $200,000 is too high a financial burden for them,” observed Judge Flenaghan.
But one such measure was not sufficient as a guarantee that it would not disappear, the judge added.
Maximovich was allowed to be released under bail, provided that he would deliver his Australian and Serbian passport, be observed in the police every day and observe the ordering hour from 6 o'clock in the evening to 6 o'clock in the morning.
Fotois Caccicaris: "I am proud of Greece's assembly, which has been fought in the last few seconds."
The main coach of the Greek assembly Fotis Cacicaris paid tribute to his team after winning the 1/4 Eurobasket-2015 final with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the games made some mistakes.
It was a big game, quoted by the AFP Cacicaris.
We're ready for a great Spanish game.
Efforts have been made to combat, but the defence errors have determined the fate of the meetings.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my boys.
They fought up to the last second.
Joel Freeland: "I'm going to be assigned to CSCA's functions."
CSA Newsman Joel Freeland said he didn't believe in the curse of the army.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to break down the negative trend and finally win the Eurolycus next season.
I spoke to Coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and myself, after I joined the team, quote "R-Sport" Friland.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to reposition the central position, but in the NBA, I've been playing forvard more.
Now you'll have to stand up to a big central rival, but I've done it before, so I think, and I'm gonna do it now.
The army last won Eurolygia in 2008.
Since then, they've gone six times to Final Four, but they couldn't always show their best basketball.
It's a good idea that someone was wrong with the team.
In this whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's complicated, I understand all the disappointments of the club and its sick people.
But we have a great team now, and if we're going to show the best of what we can do, we have a good chance of winning Eurolyse, I really think so.
He always wanted to win this title, the muskets have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be CSCA year.
As for the blind, I am not a believer, and I do not believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, it's possible.
I don't have any rituals, I just listen to music and I'm trying to relax as much as possible.
Luis Enrique: "For me, the match with "Rome" will be special."
The chief coach of Barcelona Luis Enrique has not been able to hide that he has returned to Rome for the 1st round of the team tournament of the League of Champions with Rome with special feelings.
According to the teacher, his current and former team's visual unity will be far from complete.
Let us recall that Luis Enrique trained wolves in 2011/12, but failed to show up on the best side in the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome a few years later, for which I have gained some experience. - The official website of the UEFA, says Luis Enrique.
I have very warm memories of Rome.
It's gonna be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start the Champions League with the victory.
The August meeting at Kubke Joan Gamper does not affect the actions of the teams in the next match.
I'm looking forward to the Roma game she showed in series A against Juventus.
It's a strong team that can repress and know what to do with the ball.
Wadim Skrypchenko: "Craznodar" has various options for attacking."
The Acting Chief Coach Ural Vadim Scripchenko, in front of the 9th Tour of the League of Prime Ministers with Krasnodar, noted the variety of attackers of the rival's team.
According to the teacher, the "bigs" have several models of the game in their arsenal in attack.
The unit will be held on 21 September and will begin at 16.30 in Moscow time.
As we play with Krasnodar, let's see, the official website "Urala" says "Scripchenko."
We've got a week ahead of us.
This team has different options for attacking, multiple-faced attacks, while we're not slow, so I think it's going to be a very interesting game.
In the forefront of this game, given that Krasnodar is the winner of the European League against Dortmund, we are trying very well to prepare for victory.
Roher Kanys: "The House of Astana" can choose the eyes of anyone.
Astana's defender Roher Kanys, after the 1st round of the team tournament League of Champions with Benfi (0:2), expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future.
According to Habbek, as a result, the astutes are able to select their eyes from any rival.
Although the match has been hard for us, I can say that we played well, the official website of the UEFA speaks of Kanyas.
Benfia's above the class, but in a home match, I think we can count on them to pick their eyes.
That's quite real.
But first we need to think about Galatasarae and then about Atlético.
In domestic matches, we can pick the eyes of anyone.
Raphael Bennetts: "The second time you like, Christian Ronald is the best in the world."
Master Coach Raphael Benitis expressed satisfaction with the great victory in the 1st round of the team tournament League of Champions with Shatter (4:0).
The specialist gave credit to Christian Ronald, who was the author of three heads.
Match was uneasy, because Shatter has the ability to control the ball, says the UEFA official website of Benits.
The rival had not many moments, but their contractions were always a threat.
I'm not gonna say that "Real" played perfect, but we've had enough of that.
I'm glad we didn't miss the ball and we killed four.
Christian Ronald confirmed his level.
It's the best game in the world, I'll repeat it as often as possible.
"Christian Ronald can't be compared to Messy."
The protector of Barcelona, Jordi Alba, believes that no one can compare with his associate Lionel Messi.
According to Spanish, the Forvard "Reala" to Christian Ronald can't do it either.
Messies on five heads above the others, quote Le Figaro Albu.
Even Christian Ronald.
Leo in the field is changing, I can't compare it to anyone.
Daniele De Rossy: Barcelona has not only a unique style but also a bright individuality.
Half Defender of Rome Daniele De Rossi at the start of the team tournament of the League of Champions with Barcelona noted the importance of compactity and insurance in the game with such a strong opponent.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, beginning at 21.45 in Moscow time.
Remember, the S.E. will carry out its textual transmission.
"Barcelona" is a special rival, a good team of great players, quoting the official website of the UEFA De Rossi.
It's difficult to play with the boys, because they have not only a unique style, but also a bright individuality.
To let them go, we're going to have to smoke all the time, and we're going to have to take care of each other.
The messies are almost always successful when they go into the environment, so we need to maintain compactity and organization.
The food is expected to go to the beginning of the SCA in a match with the Slovenian.
Golkiper SKA Ilia Ežov stressed that he hoped to join the army in the next match, the KHL champion.
The food went to ice instead of Mikko Koskinen for 23 minutes at 0:3 and reflected all the booklets on his door, the fourth goal of the SCA missed after replacing the door with the sixth field player.
The next team match will be marching against Slovenia.
I hope that I'll go out in the next match at the start-up, says "R-Sport."
I'm not an expert at the door, I'm a doorman, we don't have the missing heads again, so it's hard to track.
"Dinamo" played well, everyone has bad matches.
The team's still lost.
I'd better skip bigger, but I win the team.

Lucy Shafaržova is hospitalized with bacterial infection, reports AFP.
At this point, a Czech tennis player is at a clinic in Brno.

Stephen Hogg used the girl's phone to get the pedophiles to send pictures.
Pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of violence against children.
Stephen Hogg picked up the girl's phone while she was asleep, registered to the Internet message service, where he received a number of inappropriate images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found her phone missing, and found it in Hogg's sleeper's hand.
She checked it and found shocking photos, and then she immediately drew her mother's attention to it.
The police came and saw five images, after which they examined the computers found at the address, and found “relevant” requests in the search system using words to detect improper images of children.
Hogg then told the police what he did, because it could "draw the paedophiles," and then he would "make him a cop to scare them."
The judicial officer, Elid Robertson, told the sheriff's court in Dandi: "He said it was a passion, he was afraid to scare people.
He admitted that he had made requests on the computer, but he said that it was because he wanted to be a police officer to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversation with an unknown person who had sent images to him and that he had requested further photos.
He said he was doing this to trick them.
He said he had a problem with his head when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added, "When the girl found pictures on the phone, she called her mother, she would cry and she would cry.
She saw ill - mannered images on the phone, and at the time, the defendant was given an eye rate.
The girl was interrogated and reported that the accused used the computer and the Plasteischen to talk to the girls who looked very young.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road in Dandi, confessed to the charges made in the manufacture of childless photographs on 14 June last year, in violation of the conditions of 25 January of this year ' s deposit and not in court on 24 March of that year.
Advocate Gregor Sim applied not to bring Hogga to the list of persons committing sexual offences, as it could be shown that there was no "significant sexual element" in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmicle postponed the sentence until October until a report was received from the social services.
Hogg was released in custody in this case, but he was detained before hearing other cases.
It was listed as having committed crimes of a sexual nature until the date of the sentence.
President Robert Mugabe is not reading that speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the senior African state leader, fell off a ladder leading from the podium earlier this year.
He didn't get hurt, but the videoist with the fall scene was currently spreading on social networks.
The opening of Parliament was also overshadowed by statements by parliamentary opponents that they had received anonymous threats warning them of the formation of Mugabe at the time of the trial.
Months ago, they raised the President at the time of his address to the nation in Parliament; that is what Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
A member of Parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change, Innocent Gonoze, said that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones to prevent Mugabe from interrupting.
“The message came from a number that is not reflected, but it is entitled Death,” he told reporters at the end of Mugabe’s speech.
Noted Members of Parliament warned that integrity was ending in Parliament's building, and as soon as they left, parliamentary integrity did not work.
A member of Parliament said that the party headed by Morgan Cwangaria was " worried" about its policies.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to reduce from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs under its service restructuring and reduction programme.
This same year, Hewlett-Packard is divided into two companies registered in stock exchanges, separating the production of computers and printers from the fastest-growing hardware and service sectors.
As a result of the projected job cuts, approximately US$ 2.7 billion, from the fourth quarter, is reported in Hewlett-Packard ' s statement.
"This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Witman, President and Director General Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more focused than Hewlett-Packard is currently, and the business portfolio will be wider and deeper that will help the company move to a new business style," Witman said.
As a single company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients worldwide.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual surplus of over US$50 billion and will focus on the provision of previously inaccessible integrated technology solutions, reports the company's statement.
This is how the company, founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Heulette and Dave Packard, is divided into electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto was named "the birthplace of the Kremney Valley".
Hewlett Packard is in a process of large restructuring to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This is a step by HP, the second in the world of personal computers and one of the largest US technical companies, the latest developments in this sector, based on confidence that second-rate companies are working better.
Captain Arsenala Mikel Arteta says his associates must support traumatized Jack Wilshire before playing with Dinham Zagreb.
In his conversation with Wilshire Wenger, he also stressed that only September, and that, provided that Wilshire's restoration was planned, nothing would prevent him from returning to Christmas.
In the most favourable development of Wilshire events, at least four of the following games will be missed in England and its participation in the European Championship will remain under discussion the following summer.
Most of all, this recent problem is that Wilshire has certainly ended the previous season with the only trauma and is going back to the usual aggressive style of the game during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This trauma does not threaten his career."
It's just not the end of the living bone.
It's nothing serious.
It's just a coincidence.
This is not related to the locks or injuries that have occurred before.
This may be medically related, but, as Wenger has also permitted, there is a risk of additional injuries to any player returning to the middle of the season.
There is also a negative trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has 23 different injuries that occurred to him in six years after his debut.
He also played only 65 of the 157 Arsenal games in the league in the last five seasons.
If you look at the Arsenal schedule wider, you can see that in six of the eight seasons, starting in 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two Premier League clubs, which account for the most missed due to the trauma of days.
Wenger recognizes the likelihood of an aggravation in the vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in trauma statistics will continue in the last season.
"Sometimes after the trauma, you'll be vulnerable for some time -- for that time you need to regain your strength and gain a competitive advantage," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to be able to do it.
I hope he'll recover physically, I'm sure his career will be what he deserves.
Arsenal launches a team of champions at the League in the middle of a match with Dynamo-Zagreb and will continue on Saturday with Chelsea and the next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the composition.
Ector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsi did not come to Croatia, so they would probably play Mother Debushi and Arte.
Wenger may also introduce Kiran Gibbs and Olivier Giru instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep a balance and give a little pass to the players that need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is an unconditional favorite in Group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most striking in Europe.
"Dinamo" has not lost any of the 41 match since they had the last season as "Invincible".
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was affected by an earthquake of 3.2 balls on Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal has learned a lesson from last season when the team suffered a defeat at the Monaco Championship League, and it remains with little hope to lead the club to victory at the Cup Championships Final.
"It's an incredible drive," Wenger noticed.
Arsenal has never done that before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but, on the other hand, I am a realist intern.
We have ambitions, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons of male friendship
The absence of such stories is being ignored, especially if it is taken into account how desperate the need for men to be honest is now more than ever, while the level of suicide among young men is up to 15 years old.
In 2013, this was the only major cause of the death of men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and it will happen to men three times more often than to women.
In an attempt to address the problem of the Campaign against Life Unhappiness, the year 2015 announced a year for men to challenge a culture that does not allow men to seek help when they need it.
The company is at the centre of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of over 2,000 university students with symptoms of depression revealed that if a patient has a sufficient number of “normal” friends, the chances of treatment are doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of healthy friends doubles the chance of a mental disorder.
But, of course, the friendship should work, first of all, it needs to be.
In a time when communications are managed by social networks, when the style of content is preferred, the speed of response is often more appreciated than the content of contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to be strong, loving, happy, and successful, even if it is a reality of loneliness.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely on the basis of internal values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a greater impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire recently noted, video game maker, for money, don't buy any more happiness.
The dignity of Friends is that they draw this attention.
Each person was determined, not by his work, but by the personality that appeared in association with friends.
Jumor Joey and Chandler's constant hugs, the moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross' breathing at Rachel's - all comes from the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully studying their feelings.
As the Samaritan officer told me, "...my role as a listener for people who feel depression and suicidal attitudes emphasizes how even the slightest communication of friends can benefit."
Often the men who turn to us feel powerless to talk to their friends.
The old teaching "live with it" is as strong as the feeling that a frank discussion of problems can be perceived as weakness."
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I'm trying to offer longer working mechanisms to overcome.
It underscored the small points of male friendship.
With regard to my task, the status of a telephone interviewer helps people at times of despair, and long-term support comes from a close family and friends.
So, if you visit FriendsFest at Comedy Central in these exits, where for the holiday, the decorations were completely restored, why not take your friends to Central Perk for a drink.
Or, better yet, if you see a single man in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
Don't think about the benefits that friendship can bring before you.
Series Friends show at Comedy Central from the beginning and to the end, all 236 series, by tag #FriendsFest
De Maria's killing the goal by helping the GSP to blow up Malmo.
Angel de Maria is celebrating the dead ball at Malmé's gate with the Black Matthew and Edinson Cavani.
Angel Di Maria, a winner of the Champions League, killed a goal, which allowed the PSG to easily leave Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's a match report and a game reaction.
Angel de Maria and Edinson Kawani did their job when Pari Saint-German started their game at the Champions League with a very comfortable victory 2:0 against Malmo at Park de Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria killed a ball less than four minutes after his first game at the League of Champions began as a game of the "PSG" to send to the French champions, but they lost a number of opportunities before finally increased their advantage when the Kawani shot the goal at 61 minutes.
Along with Real Madrid and the Dutch Shatter in Group A, Pari had to take a good start in the game against the Swedish champions, because they aimed not at qualifying the playoffs, but to continue a series of successful three seasons, where they came to four finals.
They earned their eyes, but at the same time it was not the best decision by Lauren Blan to consider Gold Ibrahimic as useless in the attack and later to replace him in the field against a team from his hometown and club, in which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win a home or a guest in the Champions League, so winning a 2:0 win, delivering problems to the opponents and playing well for protection is a good start, even if there are other moments we will need to finish during the season," Blan said.
That's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did, although I'm sorry we didn't kill for one or two more balls.
Ibrahimovic returned after the trauma in one of the replacements of the Paris team, which brought her nothing with 2:2 in the match with the "Bordo" in the First League in the exits, but took him back to De Maria's last plan for the fourth minute.
The Argentine attacker noted that he was a player who was able to bring the GSPs to a new level in Europe after being redeemed at Manchester United last month, and he proved why when he escaped from Marco Verratti behind the protection of Malmo and ended his attack beautifully by sending a ball outside Johan Willand to the far corner of the gate.
However, if someone expected the "PSG" to be easy and great victory, they had to be disappointed.
Malmö, who defeated Seltik in the playoff to reach this stage, was a serious opponent of the nine world-level players in the field at the start of the game, five defenders and two resistance-stempers in the middle of the field.
But with the exception of the strike of Nikola Jurdzic, where the ball flew past the further shack of Kevin Trappa's gate at 34 minutes, they attacked a little bit.
Therefore, in times of unrestrained transmissions and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimic, who was unable to make at least five attempts in the first half of the day, and then failed to process the sword killed by Cavani immediately after the game was resumed.
However, he showed himself much more capable in precise passports, and it was a passport from Ibrahimic, which, Di Maria, had sent a ball with a round punch, which had been pushed to the stand outside of Viland for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally killed after an hour's notice by Kavani, the Uruguayan killed his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimic had put the ball sent to the center of the left-wing flag Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas that had been at Malmö about the return to the game, and only the capture of the sword by Viland from a close distance did not allow David Luis to increase the final count before the goal of replacing Esekiel Lovessi was set at the end of the match.
Coach Malme Age Harede later admitted that the PSG was a class above his team, while the Norwegian said, "Our last game at the League of Champions took place last December".
Since then, we have played only in the Swedish League, and that's not the level.
Qualifications are insufficient.
Famous Parry!
It was a great match with them.

The White House confirms the visit of Si Xinpin to Washington
The White House confirmed on Tuesday in an official communication that the head of China Si Xinpin would come with an official visit to the United States at the end of this month.
This visit, the first visit of Si China to Washington, will take place on 25 September and will be a response visit to President Obama's visit to Beijing last November, as stated in the statement.
The President and the First Lady of the United States Michel Obama will also welcome Si Xinpin and his wife, Pen Liuan, at the government dinner the same day after two leaders hold bilateral negotiations.

The successful biker in Kutuzovski was given a colony for two years.
In addition, the Court has partially satisfied civil claims of the victims to Danny Mirzoev at 1.2 million rubles.
The Dorogomilov court of Moscow sentenced Danny Mirzoev to death of a motorcyclist in the Kutuz Province of Moscow.
According to the Russian News Service, Mirzoev received a two-year prison sentence in the colony-pocket.
He was found to be guilty of the article "Infringement of traffic rules and the operation of vehicles".
In addition, the Court partially met civil claims of 1.2 million rubles.
During the debate, the prosecutor requested Mirzoeva to be sentenced to three years in prison and to obtain full-time claims for victims of eight million rubles.
The accident on 22 May occurred about three hours of night in the area of the house 30 on the Kutuzovske Prospect.
The BMW car, which was followed by Mirzoev, crossed the traffic field and hit a motorcyclist standing on the corner.
The birth of a man in 1989 ended on the ground.
Friends of the deceased in social networks reported that the BMW driver was driving at high speed and headed to the meeting area before the DTP.
Fearing that the driver was trying to get away from responsibility, the bikers organized a motorcycle test from the Walls to the building of GUMVD Moscow in Petrovka, 38.
Soon thereafter, it was known that the investigation had led to the alleged crime of the DTP.
In Moscow, a blind man was detained in the temple.

More than 40 orders and orders were signed by the Governor of the Tumen Region, Vladimir Jakušev, at the meeting of the Bureau of the Regional Government.
Some of these included the provision of funds for educational and health institutions in municipal education.
In particular, funds are being made for the purchase of a bus for one of the schools in the Lower Town Area, for the capital repair of the district hospital in the Kazan District.
As indicated in accompanying documents, the money will be completed at the capital level of the second floor of the therapeutic office.
Warm and cold water supply, water supply, power grids and electrical equipment, ventilation systems will be refurbished, rooms will be refurbished, fire safety and energy conservation activities will be carried out.
There will be a second forum for the regions of Russia and Belarus in Sochi.
There will be a second forum for the regions of Russia and Belarus in Sochi on 17-18 September, where the Tumen delegation will take part in the leadership with the Governor.
The forthcoming event in Sochi and the interim outcome of the cooperation is described by the Honorary General Consulate of the Republic of Belarus in Tumenia Vladimir Shugla, who is in the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovic, what are the tasks of the Socinian Forum?
The large event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Federal State.
It is based on fruitful cooperation between regions, an important link between the two States.
It is planned that the plenary meeting will be attended by the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin and the President of the Republic of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko.
Plenary and sectional meetings will focus on the experience of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, regulatory and programmes of the Federal State.
The Governor of the Tumen Region will take part in the forum.
I think this is evidence of successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
The forum will also be attended by representatives of the respective ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tumen region, will be provided.
I hope that the Forum will help to conclude new beneficial contracts and agreements.
I will add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk last June.
More than two hundred delegates, including 19 regions of Russia, participated in its work.
At that time, a very important treaty on cooperation between the Tumen and the Minas had been signed.
The importance of our work is also stated by the fact that there has been a permanent seminar in Tumena at the Russian and Belarus Union Parliamentary Assembly.
In addition, the APC delegation of the Tumen region visited the Republic of Belarus with a view to exploring the experiences of Belarusians in training for agriculture, the identification of additional cohesiveness points and the organization of new investment projects in the agro-industry complex.
You have recently met with the head of the region and head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with the Governor of the Tumen Region, Vladimir Jakušev spoke about the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus in the context of today's unparalleled conditions.
The issue of the supply of Belarusian agricultural technology and the use of financial mechanisms is needed to reduce the cost of machinery for the final consumer.
Problems were discussed in the work of the Tumen Chamber of Commerce "Belshina " and options for preventing losses.
Matters are important, as investment projects must work clearly and bring income to the region.
This was the further supply of OAO freight equipment "MAZ", the development of the OAO service centre "MAZ", which was established in Tumenia on the OAO "PTAP" basis.
The discussion also focused on the preparation of the region ' s working delegation ' s visit to the Republic of Belarus by the end of the current year.
Another topic was the conclusion of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific and cultural cooperation in the Tumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of relations promise to come to a new level.
These issues were also addressed by the Regional Centre.
At the meeting with the head of the Tumeni City Administration, Alexander Moore, we discussed the renewal of the Tumen bus park.
About 100 buses are already "halved" and a new batch of cars from Belarus is required to operate on a gas, clean fuel.
Another aspect: The Tumen elevator works with one of the leading elevator manufacturers of the MOO Moglievliftmash.
In my view, these activities could become more active, taking into account new elevators in the area centre.
I would add that within the expanded powers of the Council, a meeting was held with the Governor of the Kurgan Region, Alex Kokorein, who discussed the issue of increasing trade and the provision of modern Belarusian technology in Zaurala.
At the end of September, a meeting was scheduled with the Ottoman governor.
The expanded consular district is composed of five RF entities, but Tumenn can be called its own county headquarters.
The region is a site for covering many promising projects, including the work of the honorary consul.
In general, such meetings are important and good to enable many problems to be addressed directly and quickly by taking them away and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current circumstances, it is essential not to destroy the prize by continuing to work in the future.
Matt Damon against focusing on the ethnic diversity of people employed in film production
Matt Damon argued with the African-American producer Effy Brown, saying that there was no need to take ethnicity into account.
At the time of the resurrection, Project Greenlight on the HBO channel was hit by a well-known actor, Brown, when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative views on the main black heroin in the selected scenario.
"The diversity is appropriate when you're making a cast for the film itself, not for the show," Damon insisted.
The brilliant Brown, without faith in his ears, screamed, "Oh, nothing." Now, all the time, when an actor from "Marsian" made comments in the direct air.
To discuss the finalists of the show with Damon and Brown, Ben Afflek and Brother Farrell joined his colleagues.
"I would like the participants -- no matter who will be the director -- to think about what treatment they're going to take," Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black person is a prostitute who has been beaten by a white soldier.
The film producer Dear White People was about to become filmmakers Leo Angelos and Kristen Brankačo; Damon was strongly opposed to saying, "We can't get what we want in the end."
After this discussion was shown on TV, social networks exploded with unacceptable comments to Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni said furiously about the video: "The explanation of the essence of the diversity of Matt Damon's only black man in the room TACOE BELOE, which is painful."
Twitter's got more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's statements appear only once when the literacy of the theme in the media is the most pressing issue on the public debate agenda.
After a young man named Michael Brown was shot by a police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained popularity throughout the country, urging lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the colouring population.
In February, the singer Prince mentioned this movement during the nomination of candidates for the album of the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black people's lives, albums still matter.
Recently, the Black Lives Matter movement leaders issued an official statement in response to the question of collaborator Fox News Elizabeth Hasselbeck whether this group would be considered as a group of haters.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," the movement leaders reported.
It was recently announced that Damon had been included in the list of performances of show business, producers and media magnets invited to visit Pope Rome to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
I don't know if the actor accepted the invitation and met Papa.
American Ninja Warrior rewards the first champion
On Monday evening, the professional scalalas and Assistant Officer Isaac Caldjero became the first winner of the American Ninja Warrior show, taking home a $1 million prize.
At this sports show, the 7th season just ended, none of the participants were able to pass all stages of the road with obstacles.
In the final season, two participants, Caldero and operator Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task included a 75-foot rope lift in 30 seconds.
Britten did his first assignment and set out at the appointed time, became the first athlete for the entire history of American Ninja Warrior, the last dive phase 4, but Caldjero managed the challenge three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
After winning a victory, Caldero, who was shocked at winning a million dollars, interviewed E!News.
"I've never earned or lived more than $10,000 a year," said Izek to reporters E! so serious a leap in my income.
And secondly, I've never even imagined what it's like... the future doesn't know.
Executive producer Kent Weid met with reporters "The Hollywood Reporter" to talk about the final and why Britten, who first went on the track, won't get any money prize.
According to the rules, money is the fastest participant.
"If the final players are more than one, the prize will be the fastest of them," said Weid.
Although money is a wonderful reward and a change in life, it still has great satisfaction.
I don't think he's feeling a bit offended about this.
He was happy what he did.
He's got tons of excited feedback from the fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "If I've been told to lose someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we changed our roles.
The show "America Ninja Warrior" will be back with the eighth season, which will start shooting in spring 2016.
"Dear Tigers" quietly walk through Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season was not particularly fun for Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, Tigers is now taking the last place in the Central American League.
I'm just claiming to be a little confused, "Tigers" with a flash win on Tuesday at Minnesota Twins with a result of 5-4 on Targetfield.
Twins missed the chance to cut half-games off Houston Astros and take second place in the game-off according to the number of points after the winners.
For the Detroiters, let's even one night, it was a return to the letter F, which pushed most of them into the second half of the season.
"All the winnings are fun, it doesn't matter how they get," reported the Tigers Manager Brad Osmus.
Pitcher "Tajers" Alfredo Simon made his contribution to supporting the attacks, which resulted in Detroit picking up three points in the first two innings, then adding one more in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a painter in 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was only his third quality start for nine exits.
"I just want to finish the year with good indicators," said Simon.
The replacers can't be dropped in each game, so I want to go deeper into the game.
The "Tajers"-designated Victor Martines was able to undo three strokes and got two wounds -- the first RBI from mid-August.
It was the first day with three hits from four hits in the game against Seattle Mariners on July 6th.
"He worked well in battle," said Osmus.
He showed himself well in (butter quality), much better at work and kept this quality for the game.
When he got three in the second half of the seventh inning, "Twins" got their best chance of getting back into the game.
The central host, Bajron Baxton, opened the inning twice on the left-hand side of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks, made a band, took the first base, and the second bassman Brian Dozer got a strike-out from Simon before he took his place left Blaine Hardy.
Hardy went to Morea, the only toy on the way, before the newly appointed turning Miguel Sano, who took the two-run single to the left of Drew Verhagen.
In the case of a couple of wounded not in a car and a comparator wound on the second base of VerHagen, it was possible to bring Trevor Pluff's third battalion to a double-platform.
This was the 27th time for the leading league game in the season when Pluff shot the ball on the double-play.
After Detroit had added the insurance wound in the first half of the ninth inning, Morer earned RBI "double" in the space between the outfielders against the closing painter "Tagers" Bruce Rondon, and account was 5-4.
However, the playwright beat Sano after three strikes and got his fifth saw.
Detroit benefited from the temporary failure of Phil Hughes at the start of the game.
The Tigers worked three wounds in the first two innings against a deserving drinker, who was on the list of traumatized before the game itself, without more than a month in connection with the ignition of the explanation.
"It's definitely not the start I'd like," said Hughes, "but as the game developed, I felt more comfortable and so I was able to carry out a few pretty good breaks in the third inning."
After the first beater reached the first base, he placed a single second bassman on Yen Kinsler.
The eye on two cars of the Rajfielder J. D. Martinez took Victor Martinez out, who made a single in the middle for the first morning in the game.
Victor Martines finished his "0 per 21" series with the runners in a successful position.
The third base game Nick Castelianos followed by a single one, but Victor Martines was shot in an attempt to get closer to the third base, so the threat was eliminated.
"Tigers" increased the account in the second inning by receiving one car double from James McCann's casserole and two car singles from the central turning Anthony Gouze, and it was about 3-0.
"It was a powerful hit," said the manager of "Twins" Paul Molitor.
He wasn't very good, but he got to the right point.
Hughes, whom he was considered to have been thrown into the third inning, then replaced by A.J. Ahter's right-hand relief.
Heusu had three wounds on six hits and a four-stroke-out lesson.
NOTE: Anibal Sanches, right-handed Peter Tigers, came out of the game due to the development of the right-hand shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who had operated Sanchez on his shoulder in 2007.
For Sanchez, which is on the list of traumatized since mid-August, it is planned to start in the middle.
In the absence of Sanchez, the left-wing pier Daniel Norris will leave the list of traumatized people and go against "Twins".
Norris, who left "Tigers" at four starters since his acquisition in exchange for David Price's left-hand drinker on July 30, has 1 win and 1 defeat.
He did not participate in games since 20 August due to muscle hair growth.
"Tigers" and "Twins" will finish a series of three games on Targetfield on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will play Erwin Santan (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original complaint made by Kadyrov in the book "Pray to God" was brought to the South Sahalin Court.
In the South Sahalin City Court, the original appeal was filed by the representative of Chechnya Ramzana Kadyorov for the decision to accept the "extremist material" of the book "Pray for God: Its Meaning and Place in Islam", according to Interfax, referring to the president of the Gorsud Aleksandr Chuhray.
The Court is now awaiting possible objections from the parties.
Mr. Chuchari refused to comment on the statements made by some Members of the FP on the need to verify the need for possible cooperation with foreign services and the IGIL.
"Shoot yourself to comment on such nonsense," he said.
On 11 September, the South Sahalin City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against Judge Natalie Perchenko for recognition of the book "extremist material".
The prosecutor's office of South Sahalinska came to appeal on Friday evening.
There are nuances: in the prosecutor's office they believe that they have asked the court to accept only the opinion of the author of the book, not the revelations of the Qur'an.
According to the prosecutor's office, the judge took the wrong decision," Chuhrai reported.
The decision to accept the book “Extremist Material” was taken on 12 August 2015.
In particular, the " extravagances" of the Quran are cited as "We worship You and seek Your Help," "Do not call anyone with God."
Kadirov called the decision-makers on the book "Satans and Provocators".
He called on Members of the House to prohibit, by law, judicial decisions relating to the texts of sacred writings.
"I am firmly convinced that the Government must adopt a law prohibiting judicial decisions relating directly to the texts of the Koran and other Divine Scriptures," Kadirov wrote in his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments that offend migrants and refugees
The Facebook staff are planning to remove posts and comments that give a negative assessment to migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints to the wrong content.
To combat the manifestations of xenophobia and racism in the network, Facebook has been set up jointly with the German Ministry of Justice.
Thus, the head of the department, Hayko Maas, recently stated that the mine, together with the community's specialists, was currently engaged in the creation of a special group of moderators.
Its participants are required to track and remove irregularities in relation to migrants and refugees.
According to Hayko Maas, the authors of the non-tolerant posts are expected to receive notices indicating the reason for their removal.
Provision should also be made for the operational blocking of the wrongful content of organizations whose experts are collecting complaints from users of complaints against abuses.
The Facebook Manual is intended to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative statements to migrants and refugees, the social network management and the Ministry of Justice of Germany was taken after a sharp increase in xenophobic attitudes in the German section of Facebook.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis that had taken over the Euro-Union countries a while ago.
Yes, in Germany today, all the items intended to accommodate refugees have already been filled.
Recently, the authorities decided to temporarily relocate migrants to the territory of the former Buchenwald Conciliary.
Deprived displaced persons from the Middle East and Africa are housed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners were held under the Nazi regime.
There will be a relaxation zone in the Moscow cemetery.
In the near future, several capitals are equipped with specialized relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first will be the Buttowski, the Domodeda, and the Charbean cemetery.
The first area for psychological rest has already appeared in the Troekurov Palace in Moscow.
Such locations will continue to occur in other areas of the city.
The m24.ru portal told Artem Ekimov, who is the head of the State Budgetary Institute, Ritual.
Relaxation zones will represent small green areas that resemble parks.
According to experts, in such "angles" visitors will be able to rest, to be alone and to restore psychological strength.
In the near future, the relaxation zone will be built in the Domodedonian, Butovian and Charbine Storage and then in other areas of the capital.
According to GBU, Ritual, when the need arises to expand the storage areas, the builders are trying to maintain the existing forest masses as much as possible.
Green plantations will be used as a live shelter, which will separate areas of rest and areas directly below the burial site.
The experts of the GBU Ritual also stated their intention to make a proposal to refuse funeral burial.
New warehouses can really be free.
In addition, the GBU Ritual reported on the readiness to set up electronic terminals that would enable visitors to know the GPS coordinates and the number of burial marks.
In June this year, Ritual was also proposed to adjust the value of burial services according to the year.
Yes, the tomb’s path in summer will stand on a thousand rubles cheaply, during the winter weeks when the earth is frozen.
It should be noted that in the last year, the rates for all types of ritual services were on average 10 per cent.
Five days later, a stray predator was found in the Greek forests.
The old man was alive, although he spent hundreds of hours in the forest without commission.
The miner was able to be found through the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "The 79-year-old pensioner from the Tambov area spent five days in the forest."
No food and no water.
He was wanted by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even dog movies, but there was no result.
The man was able to be found after the search for work was connected to the helicopter.
On that day, Vitaly Alexanderovich usually went to the woods behind the canoes and canoes, but he did not return to the evening.
The family immediately sought help, and for the next day, about 30 people were rescued from the nearby village.
On the fifth day, they were joined by a fire safety centre helicopter.
Andrei Seletkov, head of the search rescue team of the Fire and Rescue Center of the Smolen Region, said: "The helicopter was attracted, the man was found."
He's gone very far, quite somewhere else.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He's been through a huge distance at his age.
It's a miracle he's alive.
The tomb was delivered to the Greek Central Hospital without any knowledge, in a very difficult condition.
The doctors diagnosed pneumonia as well as severe decommissioning and overheating of the body.
As an elderly man was able to stay alive after five days in the forest, doctors do not represent at all.
Valentina Nepša, who is in charge of the Greek CIA's therapeutic office: "A patient's study, treatment is scheduled."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Taking into account all his chronic illnesses.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, it remains difficult, but with positive dynamics.
Pensioner Vitaly Alexanderovich comes to Smolenschen from the Tambov area every year.
His grandson said that his grandfather had gone to collect mushrooms before, but he never got deeper in the woods.
Alexis Spitchenko, the grandson of the found mushroom, said, "You're not far from the road, you're not local in principle."
He's been visiting his family for almost a few years.
Well, he went after the mushrooms.
I see he's gone a long way and he's gone.
At the beginning of the grueling season, people are regularly lost in all areas of the Smolen region.
Just in the last few days, five similar cases.
Rescuers remember: In the woods we have to walk in a bright dress, with little food, spasms and compass.
Furthermore, it is desirable to leave behind traces so that they can be returned later.
The An-2 emergency seat was on average in the brotherly tiga.
On average in Siberia, An-2 is an accident.
An extra landing from the Red Air Force Enisey took place 68 kilometres from Bratska.
There are no casualties and no casualties, but the plane itself has suffered significant damage when landed.
An-2 was on a business trip.
There were three crew members on board -- the commander, the second pilot and the ship mechanic, says "Interfax".
The crash aircraft was flying over the railway of Jelezhnoursk-Ilimski, Achinsk, which is based on the airline.
The aircraft crew has already been delivered to Bratsk.
The Bratt transport prosecutor ' s office, following the crash landing, began to verify compliance with flight safety legislation.
The investigation team of the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor ' s Office went to the scene.
In September 2010, the Tu-154 crew deployed their aircraft with passengers due to technical failure to the abandoned hostage airport in the Commission.
Engines and ship electronics were rejected on the liner, but the crew made it impossible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was hurt when the plane landed.
News Economics - Nobel laureate: globalization
The printing of globalization processes should have helped to reduce global inequality.
In fact, the situation is different, but the income gap in the developing economies is growing.
Eric Maskin.
In order to correct this, it is necessary to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers, which is considered by the Chief Research Officer of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Decisions of the U.S.U.U., the Nobel Prize Prize for Economics, Eric Maskin in 2007.
Over the past 20 years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
Globalization partners predicted great benefits for developing economies.
"And these predictions have gone down a lot," says Maskin.
For example, China and India have had a significant increase in GDP per capita.
But it's not that happy.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between “poor” and “poor” in poor countries, which is seen in a high income inequality, and the exact wage of work.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article "Why global markets have not reduced inequality in developing economies", published in The World Bank Economic Review, which the U.S.A. has translated and quoted.
Together with the economist, Professor Michael Kremer of Harvard University, Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the income gap in poor countries is increasing as globalization grows, the U.S.N.N.E.
Specific processes are under way in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, Maskin allocates four levels of professional qualifications - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, the level of qualifications of poor D professionals is insufficient to cooperate with A and B professionals from rich countries.
And if C-level employees from poor countries are growing due to cooperation with B-rich staff, D-employers do not feel or their wages fall altogether.
The result is that the internationalization of production will contribute to an increase in the gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and, respectively, to an increase in inequality.
The Kremer and E. Maskini proposed an amazingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantages.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fuad Aleskerov, a professor-in-chief of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Selection of Decisions, Head of the Department of Mathematics of the U.S.U.S. Department of Mathematics.
And like any powerful theory, I'm sure it'll bring empirical work to an end in this area.
The problem, in the view of Eric Maskin, is to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the employees themselves, as the scholar notes, do not have the means to pay for their training.
In this situation, Governments, international agencies, NGOs and private funds can play a significant role, Maskine believes.
The scholar notes that the theory developed does not in any case call for a halt to globalization, which has produced and produces its fruits in the form of GDP growth.
Derbent: A live connection of time.
Derbent, one of Russia's oldest cities, noted his 2000s in September.
In the festival programme, the National Culture Festival of the Dagestan Peoples and the Yarmarque in the style of the past, the exhibition of Derbent Caves and the Day of Open Temples, the two-hour historic-musical show and the tour of the reconstructed Peter I Museum.
Middle Ages of the Narin-Kala fortress, ancient Arabic inscriptions on walls, narrow alleys and garden gardens, all of which came from the "Thousands and one night" pages.
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has remained in its place since ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, by the Byzantines, by the Hazar Kaganat, and by the Golden Order.
The age of the eastern plains, which grow in the courtyard of the Derbent Juma Mosque, is equal to several centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the Universe's "Drevija" program of living nature.
The shade of scattered cranes saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
The guests of the mosque will be served with aromatized tea and will be served with dagestian lacquers, honey angrier, lum, musculoskeletal, beauties, iron and sweets.
In Derbente, the calm of the centuries is used by many suicides to drink a cup of plenty of guests for once.
The inscription on the entrance to the Juma Mosque says that the building was built in 115 years.
That's 733 on the Gregorian calendar.
It's the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is filled with space and festiveness: the arcades of domes and containers are based on square columns and are covered by the sun's windows.
The content and distribution of pigeons is the traditional involvement of the Derbents.
The owners of domestic birds put pigeons in the courtyards, under trees, on the creeks.
A fascinating sight is a flight into the sky of white pigeons, similar to the flash of a holiday fireworks.
To defend against the enemy, ancient Persians closed the Caspian gates of a double stone wall.
Going 500 meters into the sea, this facility stopped the port of Derbent.

The cobras in Derbente were still in the V century, and the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged until today.
In one of the urban markets, the streets are sold on any taste - the bars of the shear, the boy or the soldier of all colors and shades, with the fur and without it, with a complex ornament and a spectacular fireplace.
The construction of the city began with a magala, a flat with one-storey stone structures.
Over the years, the jaws have barely changed.
Only satellite tiles, wall conditioners and street lights remind you that you are not in the middle of the century, but in the modern city.
In the old part of the city, details of the watercourse built by the Persians were preserved about a thousand years ago.
To this day, ancient sources of water have been used by locals today.
Many derbenz prefer ordinary water from tap water from verified historical fountains.
There was one of the fire brigades in Derbente.
The velvet and velvet vases, the velvet, the velvet, the cups were appreciated throughout the Caucasus.

The former Virgin Bani is currently working at the Museum of Culture and the Art of Ancient Derbent.
In the past, unmarried girls and bridesmaids have been washed out in the company of friends, and now anyone who wants to see a pool, a hot and cold pool that has gone into the past for bathing.
In most Derbent houses there are hot water, but baths and couples are as popular today as they were in the past.
For the benefit of heating the body by a couple, ancient books have been written.
After the bath, the blood improves, the muscles lose weight, the body acquires flexibility and ease.
The Society Festival, which is held in the territory of the Narin-Kala fortress, is attended by the ethnic courtyards of many areas of Dagestan.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk songs, play songs of the peoples of Caucas and enjoy visitors with delicious home cheese.

The brothers Gabriel and Albert Jacobs are chained and sold by customers in a small salon near the Upper Base.
Paricmacher has been in this place for many years.
Receptions of the cirrhosis are passed from generation to generation.

One of the streets of the Old Town was a house where the writer-decabrit writer Alexander Bestužev-Marlinski lived.
Learning Turkish and collecting ethnographic material, he described Derbent in the first third century C.E. with his ancient monuments, life, and livelihood.

Men come here to ease their thirst, communicate with friends, and solve some work problems.
As in the past, it is not recommended for women to cross the threshold of tea.
The Caspian Derbent dance ensemble was established three years ago, but has already been able to participate in the activities of the Republican and Russian levels.
The ensemble soloists repeat every day, exploring folk adventures, dangines, tats, Armenian dances.
With the arrival of evenings when the noise is blowing and the street bells are on fire, the locals are lying on the benches next to the halls with the speaker’s terraces.
Debents usually discuss domestic issues.
But in the premonition of the anniversary, they remember the episodes of the unique history of their city, which had an impact on the fate of the entire Black Sea and Caspian region.
There was a business "game at the airport" in Domodeda.
The capital has a new form of education.
Four hundred students have tried as airport staff.
For this, three aircraft models were installed in Domodeda.
Young people not only observed and registered passengers but also served aircraft.
All of this is in the form of a business game, but it has not come true at all.
The late voyages, immediately two passengers with a break on board, lost their trap somewhere on the way to the plane.
For this airport - ad.
A standard set of tasks to be decided on by the newsmen was based in the Angara Domodedova.
In one Angara, three major airports from different countries of the world were immediately accommodated.
Today, four hundred students from city colleges and colleges work.
An unprecedented opportunity to learn all about the interior of the aircraft.
Passenger registration, flight service, luggage traffic, even buses on the flight, stairs, and passengers were entrusted.
And passengers are very troublesome.
In one mess with the documents, the other was late for the trip, the third filled the bag with suspicious items.
And all this needs to be done, as in life, at a minimum.
For each of these tasks, they are charged with a certain amount of virtual money, as if the airline had paid them the corresponding amount for travel.
“There is a fine for failure to perform these tasks,” explains the financial analyst Dmitry Hilko in an interview with the news programme.
The officials of the Ministry of Education are closely monitored.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try a new form of education.
It has already been held in the course of secondary vocational education.
"There will be six interregional centres of competence, which will, in fact, become new models of modern colleges with modern management, with highly qualified staff, with modern equipment," explains the director of the Public Policy Department in the field of training of staff and additional vocational education of the Ministry of Education of Russia Natalya Zolotareva.
That's why students don't have global plans.
After three days of such training, they seem to need an exit.
Therefore, the evaluations for the examination had a very logical expression.
New smart eyes, the best I've ever seen!
"I received them for responding in time to our airport claim at Instagram," was a happy player, pier manager of Frankfurt Airport, Sergei Shułov.
The best judges, which is called, have been taken to the barracks to invite them to work at the end of the school.
The US Embassy regrets the closure of the US Centre in Moscow.
The US Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the foreign literature library of the American Centre.
The Centre worked in Moscow for over 22 years.
The US Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian Government to close the US Embassy centre at the M.I.Rudomino State Library in Moscow.
"The unilateral steps recently taken by the RF are questioning the commitment of the Government of Russia to relations between the Russian and American peoples that have not been interrupted even during the cold war and other difficult times in the long history of our countries," says the US Ambassador John Teffta, quoted in the Interfax.
The American Centre has established deep and strong ties between people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the centre of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and served as a venue for meetings with many American prominent actors, including cosmonauts, artists, sportsmen, scientists, politicians and writers.
"Only last year the American Centre conducted more than 400 cultural and educational activities and adopted more than 50,000 Russian visitors," the diplomat stressed.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the FLEX Education Exchange Programme (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Tribunal was quick to settle.
Typical situation: Four officials are standing at the table of Judge Svatter Kumar, hearing his claim for the work done.
The court is totally not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We have not given you an order of 110 sides, so that you may be comforted in it, says Kumar.
If there's one more tow, we'll order all the existing structures to be removed.
Kumar is headed by the National Green Tribunal (NPT) - a judicial authority established in 2010 to stop the rapid pollution of the environment, which has resulted in a sharp economic growth in recent decades.
During this period, the Tribunal has been able to consider more than 10,000 air pollution, waste collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction claims.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to cease the construction leading to pollution.
The rates are incredibly high: for the under 60 years since India had declared its independence for enhanced industrial development, it had become the country of virgin jungles into one of the most populated and contaminated countries in the world.
The problem is particularly acute in large megapolises, where the development of infrastructure does not lead to a rapid urbanization: the cities are covered by dense power, the rivers are filled with pesticides and wastes of businesses and households, and the few remaining living masses are cut off by new living quarters.
Despite the formal support of the green movement by the State, NZT is regularly criticized by the Government of Narendra Modi, as it is often the main cause of the abolition of major investment projects.
So, in May of this year, the Minister of the Environment called the court's decisions “extreme” and “implementable”.
Sometimes the court's decisions are indeed impossible to fulfil within the time limit set by the court, as advocate for environmental matters, Raj Panjvani.
However, incomplete detachments also have a positive side: at least they force responsible persons to move.
"His main goal is to break this system," added the lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has already abolished several major constructions: to stop the construction of the airport, power stations and hundreds of smaller buildings.
In this regard, people are also trying to remember: for example, during the discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnan, which pollutes the local river by a factor.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People are losing their jobs," Kumar commented.
However, such explanations do not always come to the understanding of the simple people whose lives can be changed by a single dissipation of the judiciary.
Thus, in April, the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles from entering capital over 10 years of age than was caused by public retrieval.
Despite a sharp decline in popularity and criticism, Svatanter Kumar refused to withdraw the decision.
Instead, he ordered the Government of the Déli to purchase 10 thousand additional buses, which he had previously recognized at the factories as capable of carrying out such an order.
As the Court began to focus on pollution sources such as landfills, fuel quality and even road accidents, people’s anger began to slow down.
But the most painful topic of the principle judge was the Gang River Cleanup Program, with a pump announced by Prime Minister Narendro Modi last year.
When it comes to Ganga, the Hindus ’ sacred river, the judge often ceases to restrain his emotions and turns to screams.
You know what the word "holy" means?
Someone threw water out of Ganga for the statue of God, and there was felicity in it, and the judge was burning.
You continue to pollute the river because you think that Gang is Gang, he will take away all our sins.
This is the river we worship, and see what you do with it every day.
The cleanup of Ganga is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project announced by the new Government.
The number of fecal bacteria in this river is now more than 120 times the norm.
Each year between 1.5 and 3 out of 700 million Hindus are dying from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even made a donation to the Gang Rescue Fund for the sale of his costume, where he met with Barack Obama and another 455 items from his personal collection.
Ecologists here accused the prime minister of populism: the suit was bought for 700 thousand dollars, while at least eight billion were required to clean the river.
The Green Tribunal ' s participants agreed that India would have to go further before it could be called a developed country, but did not consider that the cost of progress should be an ecological one.
“In the developing country, talks on the environment are often seen as an unacceptable luxury,” says activist Malik Bhanot.
And the court is trying to find a gold medium between ecology and development."
The man took a few pictures of Dali on a show in Riga.
A visitor to the Latvian Union of Artists' Exhibition in Riga broke down the windows in the museum and exported the sculpture of Salvador Dali "An angel's Revelation".
The museum now features a exhibition of the work of El Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso.
The man was born in 1985 in the sculpture hall at 14:20.
He immediately said that he was inadequate: he exported the sculpture, broke the windows.
He then moved on to the premises and covered several permanent exhibits with blood.
Among them is the portrait of the message of the Mervaldisa Police chest.
According to the President of the Latvian Union, the artists of Igoria Dobacina, which is referred to as "Interfax", were also thrown out of the window.
Police and artistic experts work at the scene.
The latter determine the size of the damage and damage.
A criminal case of slander has been brought against a man.
In the Latvian Union, from 4 August to 27 September, the works of Picasso and Dali are presented with more than 200 original works of artists.

Si Xinpin calls for a more open economy for peace
The economy must be more open to the world to boost its growth, as President Si Xinpin said on Tuesday to the group that is facing the challenge of reform leadership.
“China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and developing a policy of openness,” he said, addressing the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group on Full Integration of Reform.
He said that the expansion of openness and the deepening of reforms would give the economy new impetus and life force and provide new space for economic development.
The Steering Group adopted a number of directives, including the regulation of market access for investors, the amendment of border controls, the promotion of public enterprises (SOEs) involving private capital and the revision of the population registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be phased out through experimental programmes.
This is an important step, as it will provide the market with a more important role in the distribution of resources, the rule of law in business and the promotion of openness, as stated in the statement.
The Government would also weaken the control of the powers given to its companies by guaranteeing that companies would run their own business.
The statement also states that China will allow border regions to adopt new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to strengthen local growth.
More areas will be available to private investors to increase the openness of the sub-controlling State of the economic sectors.
"The Government will not change its policy on foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better conditions," said the statement.
The application procedure for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or a green card, will be further facilitated by optimizing requirements and simplifying the delivery process itself.
The meeting also discussed the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report issued after the meeting, it was also attended by Prime Minister Li Katán and ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhan Gaoli.
