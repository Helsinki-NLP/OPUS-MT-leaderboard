Members of the Wells Assembly worried that they "look like fools"
Among some members of the Assembly there has been a concern about the proposal to change their title to the MWP (Members of the Wells Parliament).
This has come as a result of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Wells Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from all political backgrounds are concerned that this could lead to ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party assembly said his group was concerned "that this rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wells: In the lobby, twp means "stupid" and pwp means "cuck".
A member of the Wells Party said the whole group was "satisfied" and proposed alternatives.
A Wellsian Conservative said his group was "open" about the name change, but they said there was little difference between the words "MWP" and "Budalla".
In this context, the sweating of the "w" glass in the woolly is similar to that of the "u" glass in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, currently drafting legislation to declare a change of name, said: "Surely the final decision for the appointment of Assembly members will depend on the members themselves."
The law of the Wells Government of 2017 gave the Velsian Assembly a deadline to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a consultation with the public, and the last proposal for the Assembly's appointment as "Wells Parliament" found broad support.
Regarding the issue of the title of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission favoured the nomination "Members of the Wells Parliament" or "WMP", but the "MWP" option found more support in a consultation with the public.
It seems that the members of the Assembly are suggesting alternative elections, but the war on consensus can be turned upside down to Chief Elin Jones, whose presentation of the legislation on changes is expected within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes in the way the assembly works, including rules for the exclusion of Assembly members and the structure of the committee system.
During the legislative discussion, the final vote on their appointment will remain for the Members of the Assembly.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the country's name change.
On Sunday, voters will vote for the change of their country's name in the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote by the people was put in an effort to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighboring Greece, which has also a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name constitutes a claim on its territory and has consistently opposed its requirements for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, has said he will not recognise the votes.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin’s Campaigns fall silent as the churches in Harlem face difficulties
"Historically, the elderly people I've talked to say he's had a bar and a church in every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Today both are missing."
He said the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"Today, people are socializing in other ways," he says.
"The bars are no longer the point of meeting the village, where people go regularly."
As for the churches, he expresses concern that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as leaders claim "and sooner or later they will return to the starting point."
He added that churches could be replaced by palaces full of people who would not support the holy places that remained in the neighborhood.
"Most of the people who buy the living environment in these palaces are white," he said, "so very soon will come the day when these churches will be closed once well, since it is unlikely that most of the people settled in these dwellings will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a metropolis of colored people — the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation was transferred in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was taken possession of by a colorful congregation of people who had their place of worship nearby.
Saint Martin passed a colorful people's congregation under the direction of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of minority traders on the "125th" road, a main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote colourful people.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged by a fire, but since Father Johnson's familitaries planned to rebuild, they ordered the quarantine.
Rev. David Johnson, father Johnson's son and heir to St. Martin's, called the chario with pride "the foot of poor people."
The expert who played in the cartoon in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and an "historical and irreplaceable instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also stated that this was the first award-winning career in the world by a colorful musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who was transferred to a larger career in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin had not replaced him.
Recent events in St. Martin have been a complex confession of architects and contractors, some of whom have been sent by church and others from the episcopal diocese.
The council -- the leading organ of the fame, made up of the secular leader -- wrote to the diocese in July, concerned that it would "try to transfer costs" to the council of the fame, despite the fact that the latter was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some familitators complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Fishing wounds 13-year-old during a dive to catch traps in California
A fisherman has attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he is rushing to catch a fork in California on the day of the opening of the fork season, officials say.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near the Beacon's beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel has voiced for KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been interfering with some friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, when he had heard the boy screaming for help, and then had driven him along with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel said he had initially thought that the boy was simply exonerated by the arrest of some miscarriage, but then "I realized that he was screaming "He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel says that when he got to the boy, he saw that his entire clavicle was broken.
And he said unto them, All men shall go out of the water, and say, There is a fish in the water. And Hamle said, There is a fish in the water.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady's Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was declared critical.
The species responsible for the attack was unknown.
Coast Guard Captain Larry Giles said at a media conference that a shark was seen in the area weeks ago, but was defined as a harmless species of sharks.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the body.
Officials stopped access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigation and security purposes.
Giles said that there are over 135 species of fish in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the MB cosmetic market
Sainsbury's is competing Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with big store-style cosmetics, with a specialized sales staff.
In the framework of a considerable effort to enter the US cosmetic market of 2.8 billion pounds, which is continuing to grow while sales of fashion clothes and household ornaments are falling, the biggest cosmetics will be tested at 11 stores around the country and spread to more shops next year if they succeed.
The investment in cosmetics comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the once used spaces for television, microwave, and household furniture.
Sainsbury's said it would double his offer of cosmetic products to 3,000 products, including for the first time such brands as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be given more space, with dedicated areas for related markets, similar to those in shops like Boots.
Also, the supermarket will re-market its cosmetic Boutique line, so that most of the products are vegan-composed - something that is increasingly required by the newest age buyers.
In this context, the retailer of the "Fragrance Shop" perfumes will test concessions at two Sainsbury stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, south of London, while a second is expected to open later this year in Sally Oak, Birmingham.
Online markets and a trend towards daily food purchase in small quantities in local shops mean that now supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of Sainsbury, has said that the outlets will start to be more and more similar to large shops, while the supermarket network is trying to combat lower prices of Aldi and Lidl with more services and herbal products.
Sainsbury's has set "Argos" outlets in hundreds of shops and has presented a series of "Habitats" that after the purchase of the two networks two years ago, which according to him has prompted sales of food products and made them more profitable purchases.
The previous efforts of the supermarket to restructure its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments resulted in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the union broke out after a debate on how to divide the revenues from drugs into its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes three years after Sainsbury's sold his pharmaceutical business of 281 Celesio stores, owners of the Lloyds pharmaceutical network, for 125 million pounds.
He said "Lloyds" would play a role in the plan, adding an extended range of luxurious skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vich in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury, said: "We have transformed the view of our cosmetic advances to improve the environment in favour of our customers.
We have also invested in a specialized training staff, which will be ready to give advice.
The range of our brands has been designed in such a way as to suit any needs, and the attractive environment and voluntary locations show that we are now a cosmetic destination, which distinguishes from the old ways of making purchases."
Peter Jones "whispered" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the 11 million-pound deal
The Dragons Den star, Peter Jones, has gone off "shined" since the television presentation Holly Willoughby has been drawn from an 11m-pound deal with his dedicated business a dedicated lifestyle, to focus on her new contracts with "Marks and Spencer" and "ITV"
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home oriental brand and Truly accessories.
The business of these two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The 37-year-old presentation of "This Morning" addressed the Instagram to declare its departure.
Holly Willoughby has angered the Dragons Den star, Peter Jones, after the recent withdrawal of their lucrative business dedicated a certain lifestyle - to focus on its promised new contracts with "Marks & Spencer" and "ITV".
Sources say Jones was "quicked" when the gold girl of the TV agreed during a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements -- worth up to 1.5 million pounds -- meant that she had no longer had enough time to dedicate her home oriental brand to the "Truly" accessories.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double its estimated worth of 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37 years old, was directed to Instagram to declare her departure from "Truly", Jones has flown out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
A source has said: "Truly was certainly at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long future that would accompany her in the decades to come.
Its decision to withdraw left all the individuals involved absolutely tense.
No one could believe what was happening on Thursday, it was so close.
In Marlow's offices there's a warehouse full of goods ready to sell."
Experts believe that the removal of the "This Morning" presentation, which is among the most successful British stars, can cost the firm millions, due to considerable investment in products starting from yachts and kirins to household clothes and ornaments, and cause further delays in its opening.
And this could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined her as director in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones has 40 per cent of the shares in the Baldwin TV production firm.
Willoughby is expected to become an M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as a presentation of I'm A Celebrity and ITV.
Last meeting, a source near Jones has said "We don't want to comment on his business issues."
A rough conversation "and then a ram in love"
He made a joke about the criticism he would get from the news media because of his comment, which some would call him "no worthy of a president", and because of the positiveness of North Korea's leader.
Why has President Trump surrendered so much?
He said Trump imitating the voice of news reporters.
"I didn't give up at all."
He said Kim is interested in a second meeting, since their first meeting in Singapore in June was greeted by Trump as a major step towards the nuclearisation of North Korea.
But negotiations for nuclearization have been stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's main diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, addressed the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, saying that North sees no "responsive" response by the US to the first steps taken by North Korea for nuclear disarmament.
On the contrary, he says, the US is continuing sanctions aimed at keeping under pressure.
Trump held a much more optimistic view of his meeting talk.
"The things are getting better with North Korea," he said.
"We were going into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have led to positive results - stopping the missile test, helping to free the hostages and returning to the home of the rest of American soldiers.
In his conversation with Kim, he protected his unusual approach.
"It's very easy to act as President, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this overcrowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Cunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, killing hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, nonprofit foreign organizations were told that their presence was not necessary.
Despite the displacement of more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"In fact, they have made it very clear in many cases that they do not seek international support, on the issue it is a little challenging," Mrs. Sumbang said.
While "Saw the Children" is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palou to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Considering the frequent fluctuations of Indonesia’s land, the country remains very uncertain in the face of natural anger.
While shelters against the tsunami have been built in Aceh, they hardly have access to other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of a siren for the warning of the tsunami in Paul, despite a warning being issued, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
Even under the best conditions, traveling among the many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombo for treating the victims of the earthquake is traveling to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the area of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo used the improvement of Indonesia's cell infrastructure as the central point of his election campaign, and has invested a lot of generous money for roads and railways.
But the lack of funding has disturbed Mr. Joko's administration, while it is facing new elections that will take place next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressures from continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim community have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes after the outbreak of Christian and Muslim groups on the streets, where they have used handcuffs, arrows, and other cold weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool marks in the last few minutes an equivalent goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge has rescued Liverpool from a loss at the Premier League against Chelsea, with a goal at the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge took a step from Jerry Shaqiri to be around 30 yards away from Chelsea's gate, while his team was losing with the result 1-0.
He pushed the ball gently to his left before he hit the remote door.
The ball flew over the area until it turned to the right and the top of the network.
The ball saved the air from Kepa Ariszabalaga and ended up online.
"The sign was to be placed in the right position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play with the balls ahead, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I checked the ball with a touch, and I didn't think too long, but I just hit."
Chelsea was leading with the result 1-0 in the first part, after a goal in the 25th minute by the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue attacker made a replay at Mateo Kovacic during that game, before turning around the field and sprinting toward Liverpool’s midwife.
Kovacic made a quick combination in mesfuse.
Then he gave a beautiful vertical footing that led to Hazard in the area.
Hazard passed the defense in duel of speed and with a left strike marked on the second pillar, passing the ball behind Liverpool Porter's arms, Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples in the team of the League of Champions, Wednesday at 3 p.m., at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of dead from the tsunami in Indonesia goes to 832
The number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased in 832, the national disaster agency has voiced in the early hours of Sunday.
According to reports, many people have remained trapped under the ruins of buildings like the 7.5th earthquake that hit Friday and caused waves up to 20 feet high, said Sutopo Purwo's spokesman at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, is founded under the ruins of model buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman finds death by knife wound
A murder investigation was announced after the wife's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with knife wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as suspected of murder.
The police have called on residents of the area who have seen or heard anything to present for testimony.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The heat is in the early stages, but I'd like to call any person who's been near John Street at Birkenhead, who may have seen or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
I also want to call on anyone, and especially the taxi drivers, who may have caught up with movie shows, to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the victim is Birkenhead's resident and her body is found inside a dwelling.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew her came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are continuing, while the police have said it is announcing the victim's family.
A resident taxi driver in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but has been informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He's out of his mouth when he finds out what happened.
Now the residents are being informed that they will be allowed to enter their homes only after a few hours.
A police officer has been heard telling a man that the entire area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman has arrived into the crime scene.
She repeats without rest the words "that's terrible."
At 2: 00 a.m., two police vans were inside the perimeter, and another van was outside.
A number of officers were positioned within the perimeter, monitoring the housing block.
Any person who has information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact "Crimestopers" anonymously in 0800 555 111, choosing code 247 to 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament, the last monument touched by the debate on "historic rewriting"
Its removal would be a deserved punishment for the Taliban destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by its fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "getting" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "In the middle of the current debate on the removal of statues, the marking of the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace was inevitable.
The iconoclassism of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps this would be a wrong sacrifice of Cromwell for his predecessor Thomas' actions in the past century.
Cromwell's excellent portrait of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of 19th century's opinion and part of the historiography of a picture that many think is still worthy of praise.
Mr. Goldsmith spoke of "The Sunday Telegraph": "Many people, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, saw Cromwell as a defender of parliament from the outside pressure, which in his case was, of course, the monarchy.
The fact that this is a perfectly accurate portrait is the subject of ongoing historical debates.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century gave shape to our nation's further development, and Cromwell is a well-known individual image representing one side of that medal.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered."
Until the killer wounded for the Chinese farmer's death
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only with his nickname "Yuan", was found intact with a broken artery and covered in blood near a pile of pigs in the Lupanshi market in Guizhou province, reported "South China Morning Post" on Sunday.
A pig farmer is about to inject the pig vaccine at a barn on May 30th 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It is said that he had traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him naked, and discovered the door of a stable of pigs nearby.
He said that there was a large man - mouthed pig in the stable.
A medical examination has confirmed that up to 550 pounds has injured the farmer for death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloodthirsty," said his cousin identified with the nickname "Wu," as quoted in the evening news in Guiyang.
In the security footage, Yuan has been seen entering the market at 4:40 in the morning of Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager has reported on evening news that the pig was kept in isolation to prevent another attack, while the police collected evidence on the scene.
According to reports, the Yuan family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of people attacked by pigs have been noted earlier.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injury to the husband.
Ten years ago, a 650 - pound [650 kg] pig caught a Welsh farmer after his tractor, until his wife drove the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was bitten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said to CBC News that normally the pigs are not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as "stirring".
"They just want to play.
They're like little girls who are so curious... their purpose is not to hurt you.
You just have to show them proper respect," he said.
The consequences of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring large-scale reliefs to the US South-West
As predicted, the power of Hurricane Rosa is waning as it moves toward the coolest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, during the coming days, Rosa will cause floods in northern Mexico and in the South-West US.
On Sunday, at 5 o’clock in the morning, Rosa accompanied the wind at 85 miles an hour, classified as Category 1 hurricane, and found 385 miles in the southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, on the Pacific Ocean, a low atmospheric pressure zone is beginning to form, which is moving towards the East, towards the Western coast of the United States. While Rosa is expected to approach the Gulf of California on Monday in the course of a tropical storm, she will continue to push huge tropical moisture towards her north, towards the South-West US.
On Monday, Rosa will release up to 10 inches in some parts of Mexico.
Later, the interaction of tropical moisture with the low atmospheric pressure zone will result in the coming days of strong rains with widespread rainfall in the southwest.
At local level, rain nets up to 1 to 4 inches will cause immediate flooding, waste flow, and possible flooding of the land in the desert.
The high tropical humidity will result in the rate of retrieval in designated areas reaching approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in some parts of Nevada and Southern Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of snow are forecasted in some parts of the southwest, mainly over a large part of Arizona.
There is also the possibility of immediate flooding with rapid deterioration of conditions, due to the nature of the distribution of tropical rains.
Because of the danger of tropical reefs, you are not advised to walk in the wilderness with your feet.
Large strains can turn cannons into powerful rivers, and strains will bring strong winds and dust to the area.
Nearing the low atmospheric pressure zone will bring large rainfalls to parts of the southern coast of California.
The total level of wastes can reach over half an inch, which can cause small wastes and waste roads.
For the region, these will be the first rainy season.
Some tropical rains will begin to reach Arizona on Sundays and Mondays in the morning before the rains spread further on Mondays and Tuesdays.
Strong lines will be distributed to the four sides on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October in the United States can be characterized by large fluctuations of temperatures, with temperatures falling in the Arctic, while tropicals remain warm.
Sometimes, this leads to drastic changes in temperatures in short distances.
A good example is the drastic difference in temperatures in the central US on Sunday.
Between the city of Kansas in Missouri and Omahas in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, the temperature difference is about 20 degrees.
During the coming days, the remaining heat of the summer will try to accumulate and expand again.
A good part of the Central and Eastern US is expected to start October with warm temperatures, on average 80, from the South Fields to certain parts of the North.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, a temperature that would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows high chances for temperatures above the average in the eastern US during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have attended Brett Kavanaugh's trial session
Over 20 million people have followed through six television networks the interesting testimony of the candidate of High Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh and of the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that is alleged to have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, political blockade continued, and broadcasters interrupted regular programs to broadcast the turn in the last minute of Friday's events: an agreement reached by the Senator of Arizona Jeff Flake to conduct a one-week FBI investigation on charges.
Ford expressed to the Senate Judicial Committee that it is 100 per cent sure that Kavanaugh had touched it while he was drunk and had tried to switch to a gymnasium party.
Kavanaugh, in a flash of evidence, stated that it was 100 per cent certain that this had not happened.
The number of followers is likely to have been greater than that of 20.4 million people, reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company was measuring average visibility in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
The figures for other broadcasting networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has problems with the numbering of viewers from the offices.
To put this figure in perspective, the size of this audience is similar to that of a football elimination or that of the Academy Awards.
The Fox News channel, whose opinionaries have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led the other networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the 24-hour session, Nielsen said.
The ABC came in second with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest continued to remain high even after the end of the trial session.
Flake was the main character in Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as he faced protestors' riots while trying to jump to the elevator to attend the judicial session of the Judicial Committee.
In the transmission of CNN’s books, he appeared to be standing with his eyes down for a few minutes while he was being corrected.
"I'm staying here, facing you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He said to him, "You have power over many women."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he said it would have more to say during the committee session.
A few hours later, all cable and satellite networks were covering directly the time when the Judicial Committee would vote for the passing of Kavanaugh's candidacy to vote in front of all members of the Senate.
But Flake said he would do this only with the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate during the next week, as the few Democrats had requested.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, Senator Democrat Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and some other senators after him, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election was smart, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without conducting the investigation.
President Trump has requested the opening of an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing political games" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and compromising national interest, in an interview for the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the main page of the paper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued the attack on her plan for Brexit, so-called "Checkers", expressing that the proposal that Britain and the EU pay taxes on each other's accounts is "very absurd."
Wayde Sims gun murder: Police arrest suspect Diteon Simpson for LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect for the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
The 20-year-old Diteau Simpson has been arrested and questioned in prison environments under the unparalleled murder charge, Baton Rouge Police Directorate said.
Official sources have produced a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims had lost his eyes during the fight.
Police have found eyelashes on the site and says they have found Simpson's DNA traces on them, the CBS WAFB branch reports.
After asking Simpson, the police said he admitted that he had shot at Wayde by gun, causing death.
The amount for his release is set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
Baton Rouge's Eastern Medical Office has issued a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death has been a gunshot wound from the head to the neck.
The department thanks the task force of fugitives near the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the area's citizens for helping with investigations that led to the author's arrest.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva has thanked the law enforcement authorities in the area for "their zeal and the establishment of justice in the country."
Sims was 20 years old.
A 6 - foot - long six - inch - long boy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, had played basketball for LSU.
In the last season, he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 hits for each game.
On Friday morning, coach of the LSU basketball team, Will Wade, said the team was "suffered" and "accompanied" by Wayde's death.
"That's why we're worried all the time," Wade said.
The volcano boasts of Mexico City
Hire from Volcano Popcatepetl has reached the southern shores of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater was restored and 183 gas emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center had been monitoring a number of insects and insects.
Social media images showed low levels of excitement that had covered the car windows in some parts of Mexico’s city, such as Joachimilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in volcano activity, which is 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital, since a 7.1 - scale earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the independence poll anniversary
Six people have been arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the protestors have fought pro-independence with the peacekeeping police forces, while thousands have joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalan's polarizing vote on divorce.
A group of masked pro-separatists, surrounded by peaceful police forces, struck with eggs and powder, creating dark clouds of dust through the streets that are usually swallowed by tourists.
Later during the day, there was also a crackdown, while the police had to use the tires to end the clashes.
For a few hours, repeating the phrase "Don't forget, we don't forget," pro-independence groups confronted the Unionist protestors who yelled "Spaint."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries received during protests, according to local press reports.
In the region where feelings of independence prevail, tensions continue to remain high one year after the October 1st referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, regardless of whether the participation was low, as the citizens opposed the dissolution boycotted the votes.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people remained injured last year after the police tried to stop the polls at polling stations in the region through violent clashes.
Friday's rally, pro-independence groups set up camps outside to prevent a demonstration in support of national police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take another turn.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest along with his wife, said there was no hope that Catalan would gain independence in the future.
"Last year we had one of our best bags.
I saw my parents crying out of joy that they would have the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the fact that in the local elections last December there was a vital victory, although with close results, the Catalan pro-independence parties have had a hard time saving hovi this year, as many of their most famous leaders have either voluntarily left the country or are in custody and awaiting judgment on their role in organizing the referendum and declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who was registering the protest on his phone in police assistance, said the conflict was fueled by the politicians of both sides.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting the last year's trial, said he would run in elections for the European Parliament next year.
"The candidacy of European elections is the best way to oppose the return of democratic values and the pressure that the Spanish government has given us," he said.
Londonderry: Some arrested after the car broke down with the house
Three men 33, 34, and 39 years of age have been arrested since a car was hit several times with a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, about 7:30 BST.
Detective Bob Blemmings said damage has been caused at the main gate and in the apartment itself.
It is thought that at a certain point an arrow has been thrown toward the car.
Menga's strike forgives Livingstone a 1-0 victory against Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingstone secured the victory
Team from a category below, Livingstone surprised Rangers by causing Steven Gerrard to lose second in 18 matches as a team coach from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's strike resulted in a decisive outcome while Gary Holt's team matched the second-country Hibernian point.
Gerrard's team has not yet won an out-of-field meeting in Premiership, this season and next Sunday, will face Hearts, the difference with which is eight points.
But before that, Rangers will be waiting at the Rapid Vienna house at the valid game for the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone has extended the series of matching winners to six meetings, and Coach Holt hasn't yet experienced the loss since Kenny Miller replaced last month.
Livingston loses chances in front of well-defined opponents
Holt's team should've been taking advantage a lot of minutes before they signaled, as their direct attacks caused Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but hit the door weakly, and then Alan Lithgow hit out in the top-down after a head chase by Craig Halkett.
The states were willing to leave Rangers to play in front of them, knowing they could cause problems in the standard strikes.
And that's how the goal was to set the meeting.
Rangers caused a hit and Livingstone created the space. Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to create the Menga's opportunity, which hit and marked the center of the area.
Until then, Rangers had dominated the holding of the ball, but the local defense had been irreplaceable and porter Liam Kelly was almost never tested,
This way of play continued in the second part even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a wait.
Scott Pittman's strike was stopped by Rangers Allan McGregor's porter while Lithgov hit out another standard Livingstone hit.
Harkations came constantly into the Livingstone area and were constantly cleaned, while two claims for the penalty - after Halket's intervention against the incoming player, Glenn Middleton, and another hand - touched - were not taken into consideration.
Livingstone's Phenomenal Game - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingstone.
For one man, they played excellent and continued to exceed expectations in this growing trajectory.
The style of the game and their team hasn't changed much since they got back to the top, but a great deal of credit belongs to Holt for the way he has powered the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding, leading a perfectly organized defense, while Menga kept him in trouble with Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell during the whole match.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although in some cases they played very well under Gerrard’s direction, they lacked quality.
Mungo's final trail -- only once they got through the opposition defense -- and this is something that should serve as an alarm for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is expected with suspected feelings in Cologne
Saturday (September 29th) was characterized by clear heavenly smiles as Turkish and German leaders met for the morning in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aimed at regulating relations between NATO allies.
They have gone against issues such as human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
Then Erdogan headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city accommodates the largest number of Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police stopped the meeting of a crowd of 25,000 in front of the mosque, but many supporters came out in the streets to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan -- many of whom were Kurdish -- also raised their voice to condemn Erdogan's policies as well as the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Opposition protests reflect the disunity of a visitor worshiped as hero by some German Turks and despised as autocrats by some others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclists die after car crash
A cyclist has found death after being hit by a car in London.
The accident has occurred near the Crossroads of Bestword Street with Evelyn Street, a traffic road loaded in Deptford, south of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The car manager stopped, and the help providers arrived immediately, but the victim turned his life around.
The fight took place a few months after another cyclist lost his life in an accident where the author left the scene, which occurred on Childers Street, about a mile away from the site of the Saturday accident.
Metropolitan police said officers were working to identify the person and to alert his family.
Roads are closed and buses have been announced to use other roads, while car drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long High Prison: Six wounded officers during a rebellion
Six prison officers have remained injured during a riot in a high-security prison for men, the Prison Office has said.
The rebellion exploded at HMP Long Alartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST Sunday, and still continues.
Specialist officers of "Tornado" have been called to keep the riots under control, including eight prisoners and who have been confined within one of the prison's arms.
Officers have been treated locally for some slight facial wounds.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: "The prison staff with specialized training is mobilized to keep the incident under control that is currently taking place in the HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injury.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we have made it clear that the responsible persons will be referred to the police and may receive a lengthening sentence in prison."
The HMP Long Martin shelters over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had been subjected to hospital treatment after an attack by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, officers of the peacekeeping police were called to prison to keep a serious situation under control, where personnel were attacked with pooling balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with immediate flooding (which may be an advantage for areas with droughts)
Although a tropical depression rarely strikes Arizona, this is probably exactly what will happen the first days of the next week, as the remaining power of the Rosa hurricane passes through the southwest desert, spreading the risk of immediate floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued warnings of immediate floods for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to south and east Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the lead in Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday’s rainy hours.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service stated in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have received the status of storm or tropical depression in a 200-mile line from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles from Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict 2 to 4 new ones, with the amount isolated up to 6 inches on the Mogollon border of Arizona.
In other desert areas in the southwest, including central Rockies and the Great Basin, the networks are expected to be at level 1 to 2 inches, while their total isolated areas can reach 4 inches.
For areas outside the risk of immediate flooding, Rosa's nets may be a blessing, since the region has been hit by drought.
Although floods are a serious concern, some of these areas may be helpful, since the southwest is currently facing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Center for Disease Monitoring, just over 40 per cent of Arizona is facing the extreme droughts of the second category," weather.com reported.
At first, Hurricane Rosa will hit Mexico’s Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, still powerfully hurricaneed on Sunday morning, with wind speeding up to 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is struggling with cold waters over the Pacific, and as a result, power is being lost.
As a result, the hurricane is expected to strike Mexico with tropical storms in the afternoon or at the evening of the month.
Raindrops over some areas of Mexico may be strong, presenting considerable risks to flooding.
"Average of the average level of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to the northwest Sonora, which can reach up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Then Rosa will move north through Mexico, in the direction of a tropical storm, before reaching the border with Arizona in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then move through Arizona, reaching South Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main risk expected by Rosa or its consequences are strong regimes in Baja California, the northwest Sonora and in the southwest desert of the United States," the Uragana National Centre said.
These reefs are expected to cause immediate flooding at risk of life, waste streams in deserts, and land spills in mountainous terrain.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspected of attempted murder, following the wound of a 16-year-old knife in Somerset.
Adolescents were found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, about 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was escorted to the hospital, where he is currently in a state of "sustainable".
According to the Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock area.
Officials have called for the presentation of anyone who may have picked up a cell phone from the event.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has faced the humiliation and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and cruel tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a meeting in West Virginia Wheeling.
Trump said Kavanaugh "has faced the humiliation and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Congress on Thursday, denying with conviction and emotion Christine Blasey Ford's charge that he had assaulted him sexually decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness during the session regarding her charge.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day "the American people witnessed the greatness, qualities of character and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most proud lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a clean record of public service," he told the group of supporters in Western Virginia.
The president quoted Kavanaugh's appointment as saying the importance of Republican participation in the timely elections.
"We are divided by one of the most important elections in our life last week.
I won't run, but I'm contributing," he said.
"But I'm doing so much effort and I'm fighting for excellent candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats have a mission to make "block resistance".
The first main procedural vote by the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place not later than Friday, CNN assistant of a senior GOP leader said
Hundreds killed by earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, while numbers are expected to rise
At least 384 people remained killed, many of whom were forced by giant waves that were hit by the beaches when Indonesia’s Sulawesi island was hit by a earthquake and tsunami, the authorities expressed themselves on Saturday.
Hundreds themselves were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when the dolls up to six feet (18 m) collapsed on the beach in the musculoskeletal, exhaling and causing the death of many and destroying everything ahead.
Cunami followed a 7.5 earthquake.
"The day yesterday, when the threat of tsunami was born, people were still carrying out their usual activities at the beach, and as a result they did not run away immediately and fell victim to it," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman of the Indonesian disaster prevention agency, said at a press conference.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he took with himself cars, tremors, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had entered the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles per hour), before hitting the coast line.
Some people went up to the tree to save the elephants and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Peru.
The air photographs published by the disaster agency showed a series of destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and fragmented bridges and a glass of water.
Post - earthquake reports continued to crush the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes ranged in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) was voiced in a statement that energy emitted by the massive earthquake of Friday was about threefold of the nuclear bomb power dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s geographical location, which lies at the edge of a narrow, long belt, may have multiplied the power of the cannon, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "great storms" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were exemplary.
Some corpses were found blocked under the ruins of model buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 had been destroyed.
Nugroho said the number of victims and the scale of damage could be much larger along the 300 km (190 miles) coast line in northern Palo, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake.
Communication networks "extended completely without any warning" by Dongala, Nugroho said.
That area has over 300,000 inhabitants," Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and its volunteers were traveling to affected areas.
"It has already become a tragedy, but the situation can worsen even more," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticised for not giving notice of Paul’s beating by the tsunami, despite the fact that officials said that the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In amateur films distributed in social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard warning passersby down the street about the arrival of the bell tower.
Within a few minutes, a doll bursts on the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately verify the reality of the film.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive energy interruption, which cut the communications around Paul, making it difficult to coordinate efforts to escape from the authorities.
The army has begun sending goods from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated persons continue to have great needs for food and other basic needs.
The city airport is only reopened for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was expected to visit the evacuation centres in Palou on Sunday.
The number of victims from the tsunami in Indonesia is over 800.
The situation is pretty serious.
While World Vision staff from Dongala have arrived without any problems in the city of Palu, where employees are staying in interstellar shelters in their office yard, they witnessed the destruction scene along the way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is pretty serious.
Although relief groups began serious efforts to move humanitarian aid mechanisms, some complained that foreign relief workers with extensive expertise were stopping them from traveling to Paul.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and external staff may begin to circulate only if the disaster zone has been declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a regional disaster," Aulia Arriani, an Indonesian Red Cross spokesman, said.
"As the government says "O.K., this is a national disaster", we can seek national help, but this status has not yet been given".
The second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday in Paul, friends and families of the deceased still had hope that the case of their loved ones would be among the few miracles that sometimes occur in the event of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy came out of a well.
On Saturday, the rescue forces released a woman who had remained under the ruins for two days, with her mother’s corpse near her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian national team of prejudice, had trained two of the missing parachutists for Asian Games, which were closed early this month in Indonesia.
Some of the other people locked in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandag, were his students.
"As an old pro in the field of prejudice, I am very emotionally charged," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how in the hours that followed the broadcast of the "Roa Roa" sample of the pre-suppression community, he had desperately tried to write to whatsapp competitors from Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
However, his messages ended only with a grey scale sign instead of two blue signs.
"I think that means the messages were not sent," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while relieving a ATM in Newport in Levee
According to a press statement from the Newport Police Directorate, Friday morning, some thieves have stolen $26,750 from a Brink employee, who was relieving a ATM in Newport Levee.
The car manager had been emptying a ATM in a entertainment centre and trying to distribute other money, Detective Dennis wrote in the statements.
While he was busy, someone "getting up running after Brink's employees" and stealing a cash bag for surrender.
According to the statement, the witnesses had seen some suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police in number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Revenge Changes the Name in Ye
Revenge Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
declareing the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "It's officially known as Kanye West".
The 41-year-old West has been called with the yen from time to time, and has used it as the title of his eighth album, which appeared in the market in June.
The change came shortly before his release on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande in the show, which cannot come for "emotional reasons", the director of the show said.
Compared to being a shortcut of his current name of art, West has expressed in the past that the word has a religious meaning for it.
"I think "yes" is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West early this year, speaking about his album title with the radio representative Big Boy.
"But I'm you, I'm us, we're us.
I went from Kanye, which means "the only," in just "Ye", which is the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of what we are."
He is one of many famous rapists who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known differently as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he said he preferred the name Love and Brother Love.
A former West co-worker, JAY-Z, has done as he has done with or without a shared visa and capital letter.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use the army against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has pledged that he will never use military force against civilians, as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador vowed that "he will never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, military troops opened fire on peaceful demonstrators in the streets, killing 300 people, at a time when the left movements of students were taking the lead throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving student monthly grants and opening more public universities free of charge.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities push young people towards criminal gangs.
US needs to double funding for artificial intelligence
While China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US must double the amount spent on research in this field, says the investor and expert of artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments have come after various parts of the US government have declared discoveries of artificial intelligence, despite the lack of an official general strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China has announced its plan last year: within 2030, it aims to take the first place for innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.
"Budgeting the budget for research in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, because the other countries are still far behind the US and we are looking for a great future discovery in this field," Lee said.
The duplication of funding may double the chances that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will be made in the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book "The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order", published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is Executive Director of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most specific artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he created an artificial intelligence system that passed even the leading American player in Othello, and later worked as executive director near Microsoft Research and as president of the Google branch in China.
Lee praised the previous US government's competitions for technology, such as the Agency's Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects in the Defence Field, and asked when the next competition would be held, so as to help identify new visionaries.
Lee said that often, researchers in the US need to work hard to get grants from the government.
"It's not China that's removing academic leaders; it's corporations," Lee said.
Over the last few years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been working brainwashed by universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy can help the US push its efforts into the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be automatically given to people with the doctor's title in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China issued the Plan for the Development of the New Artificial Intelligence Generation.
The National Science Foundation in China provides funding for people in academic institutions, as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money for American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a Joint Centre of Artificial Intelligence, which is expected to include partners from industry and the Academy, and the White House announced the establishment of the Selection Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
Meanwhile, this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called "AI Next".
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year for research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, American legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been implemented for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum for the country's name change
On Sunday, Macedonia's people voted in a referendum to decide whether its name would change to "Republic of North Macedonia", a movement that could resolve a ten-year-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked its efforts for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, believes its northern neighbour's name constitutes a claim on its territory, and has set it a blocking veto for its membership in NATO and in the EU.
Two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name proposed, but nationalist opponents argue that the change could compromise the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the election will reach the 50 per cent necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question in the referendum vote sheet reads: "Are you a prop for NATO and EU membership through the accession of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, as one of the countries created by the collapse of Yugoslavia, this is a price worth paying to achieve membership in structures such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the country's future, for Macedonia's young people, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje said.
Although the referendum has no mandatory power, a sufficient number of Members of parliament have said they will abide by the outcome of the vote to make that decision-making.
The name change requires a majority of two thirds of parliament.
The state electoral commission stated that no irregularities had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, the vote was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 per cent of registered voters cast their vote.
"I want to vote for my children's sake, we have the country in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old, voters in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko cast their vote on Macedonia's name change referendum, which will open the way for the country's membership in NATO and in the European Union, in Strumice, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and setting up chairs in front of chairs set up by referendum boycotts.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our head up, not entering the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country is poor, but we have dignity.
If they don't love us with the name of Macedonia, we can address other states such as China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring enough necessary investments for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be pro, since more than 80 per cent of our citizens are pro-EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote was cast.
He said a positive result would "confirm our future".
According to a poll published last month by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, some 30 to 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum -- a figure below the required level of participation.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian television Telma noted that 57 per cent of participants planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent said they would vote pro.
For a successful referendum, the scale of participation should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would give the first strong strike to the pro-Western government's policy, since its arrival in power in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through all the protection of Brighton to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling faced all of Brighton's defences in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday, at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his goal in the 65th minute look extremely easy.
Argentina's shooter took a step back in the measles at the start of the action.
He drove through the three shields of Brighton, before he went out in the open field.
Later, Aguero found himself surrounded by four green blouses.
He crossed a protector and quickly passed some others to the entry of the Brighton area.
Then he followed to the left where Sterling was.
The English attacker used his exit to track the Agueros ball, which hit right and crossed the Matthew Ryan gate by throwing the ball into the right corner of the network.
"Aguero is suffering from a foot problem," the city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We discussed that he would play about 55 or 60 minutes.
Here's what happened.
We were lucky that he was empty at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the knights the first advantage in the First League match.
This goal was marked in the 29th minute.
During that action, Aguero took the ball in the Middle Ages of Brighton.
He was pretty verticalizing for Laroy Sane on the left.
Sane progressed a few steps before following Sterling on the second pillar.
The cat attacker brought the ball into the net and then ran out of the limiting lines.
The city will face Hofenheim in the valid challenge for the team of the League of Champions, Thursday at 12:55 p.m. in Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to preserve the role of the "freaker" against Rockies
With Nationals eliminated from the chance to achieve the eliminations, there was no reason to impose another beginning.
But Scherzer, who is always competitive, hopes to be given the opportunity to sign against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is a playoff for Rockies, which has an advantage with a fight against Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
Rockies reached at least one opportunity for playoff due to win 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but are still trying to get the title of the division.
"Even though we're playing for no reason, at least we can record the atmosphere of the fans here in Denver, and the fact that the opposing team will play at the highest level I can face throughout the year.
Why didn't I want to play in such a challenge?"
Nationals have not yet announced who will be the headline on Sunday, but it is reported that they are inclined to leave Scherzer to begin the meeting in such situations.
Scherzer, for which it would be the 34th presentation as a headline, held a training session Thursday and could be presented in the field on Sunday, which could be a normal day's break for it.
The player from Washington, who is shooting right, is 18-7 with an ERA 2.53 ERA and 300 "strikeouts" in 220 2/3 of the shootings this season.
Trump gathers Western Virginia in the meeting
The president referred to the trajectory of the situation regarding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, before discussing the importance of Republicans' participation in the timely elections.
"The body is crucial for everything we've done so far.
Five weeks are divided by one of the most important choices in our life.
This is one of the biggest elections -- I'm not running, but I'm contributing, and that's why I'm trying so much to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on, "You see this terrible group of radical Democrats, you see what's going on right now.
And they have divided themselves into sects, that they might regain power in any way, and ye see their shame and their folly.
They don't want to know who they are, who they are, and who they are, and who they are, and who they are. That is what they want, and who they are, and who they are, and who they are. We will not give them."
The Democrats, he said, have as mission to make "block resistance".
"And you have seen this during the last days," he said, calling the Democrats "inflicted, cruel, filthy and unfaithful."
He was referred to as the President of the Senate Judicial Committee, Diane Feinstein, as a source of dissatisfaction from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Do you spread the document?
Whoa, whoa, what?
No, well, no, I... wait a little...--her body language was pretty bad--it was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Work Party is no longer an open church.
It's intolerant to those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for the motion of disbelief against me, they did not so much.
Finally, I am not the first of the MPs of the Labour Party to whom it is said that they are not welcome -- all this because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly, just because he firmly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of disbelief was a criticism of me for the disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy faced with previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting, it was said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight-year period as local Labour Party MPs, meetings of the GC have been the same.
Unfortunately, the meetings no longer have their previous tone, and the promise of a "mildest and most pleasant" policy has long been forgotten, if ever.
It has become increasingly evident that the opposite views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptance by the party's leadership.
This began a little after Jeremy became a leader, while colleagues with whom I thought the share of similar political views began claiming that I would take a 180-degree turn and maintain positions with which I would never have agreed - either on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public -- no matter what I say -- they blow up criticism in the social media, with people asking for my discharge, they denounze the policies of the centre, they tell me I shouldn't be part of the Labour Party.
And this isn't just me.
I am aware that I am happier than some of my colleagues, since comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face gender and racial discrimination every day, but do not hold back.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of levels of violence.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said the Labour Party should feed a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a "open church", and with every motion of faith and with any change in the rules of selection, the party becomes increasingly closed.
Over the past two years, they've often advised me to lower my head, not to be so loud, and that's how everything "will go well."
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Workers' Party 32 years ago as a school student, motivated by the disregard of the Thatcher government that led my class to a general school failure, I have tried to lobby for better public services for those who need more -- whether as a member of a local council or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, even in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clear views of my political stances and the points of opposition to the current leadership.
For all those who voted for the motion Friday, I just want to say that the country is heading towards a Brexit that will touch our families, businesses and services, and I cannot understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I want to follow is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether or not members of the Labour Party: I am proud to be in your service and I promise you that no threat to discharge or political favor will prevent me from acting in your best interests.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: The Invincible Father Is Leading the List
Two late attempts may have changed somewhat the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph at the extremely fun game of Tennant's Primership today.
Now they run the list as the only invincible team among the ten teams.
Finally, it was their wonderful protection and the courage to take the risk of the winner of the local team, and coach Peter Murchie was absolutely right to be pleased.
"We've shown ourselves in every game, and we're still invincible, towards normally I'm happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "We want to congratulate the Air Team, who took more risks than we did".
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, turned into a goal from Frazier Climo, took Air to the advantage, but a yellow card for the Scottish player Rory Hughes, who came for this challenge from Warriors, allowed Melrose to show numerical superiority and Jason Baggot got a useless top.
Climo increased the advantage of Ayr with a penalty while shortly before the end of the first part, he marked and returned to the goal of an individual action bringing the result to 17-5 for Ayr before the break.
But Melrose took advantage of the second and attempted Patrick Anderson, turned into a goal from Baggot, reduced the difference to five points.
Later, there was a long interruption as a result of the serious damage of Ruarid Knott, who left with a barrel, and after the game was resumed, Ayr increased the result through a Stafford McDowall's attempt, signed by Climo.
Air Captain Blair Macpherson was subsequently punished with yellow cardboard, and Melrose again exploited the fact that they had a more unscrupulous player at the end of a hard-pressing part.
However, the locals returned, and when Struan Hutchinson was punished with yellow cardboard because he blocked the Climo, without a ball, by the penalty line, MacPherson made the "touch down", after Ayr's three (low) back moving forward.
Climo marked and did the same almost after the game was rewinded, after Kyle Rowe caught the ball hit by David Armstrong in the area and led to the fan player Gregor Henry, for the fifth attempt of the local team.
The Still Game star appears to be set for a new career in the restaurant industry
"Still Game" star Ford Kieran seems determined to enter the hotel industry, as it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed chain of restaurants.
56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays the role in the BBC's famous show, with co-scanarist and co-protagonist partner in the world of comedy, Greg Hemphill.
Suspect has announced that the ninth season will be the last for this show, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source for Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan was trying to enter the "flowering restaurant industry" of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without going to the sea hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol an improvisation of the marine fleet headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have raised the blue ocean flag.
At sea bases from Lake Titicaca in Amazon, the motto is: "The sea is our property.
His recovery is a duty."
In Bolivia without leaving the sea, the memory of taking the coast from Kili in a bloody conflict of sources during the 19th century is still quite alive - as is the desire to sail once again across the Pacific.
Now, these hopes are far greater than they have been for decades, while on October 1st, Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's decision after a five-year review.
"Bolivia is characterized by hovi, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course, is looking forward to the result," said Roberto Calzadella, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the GJND session on large screens across the country, hoping the Hague tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia that - after many decades of irregular discussions - Killi is forced to hold talks to give Bolivia a sovereign territory out of the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president - who faces a controversial battle for the second mandate in the coming year's elections - the decision of Monday is very important.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he pledged at the end of August.
But some analysts are thinking that there is very little chance that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia -- and that even though they would change little.
The UN headquarters organ in the Netherlands has no intention of giving another state part of the territory of Kila, and it has said it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that GJND is making a decision only six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the issue "was not complicated", Paz Zárate, an expert on international law, said.
And instead of helping Bolivia's cause, the events of the past four years may have penalized her.
"The issue of access to the sea is compromised by current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morale's aggressive rhetoric has disappeared every trace of the remaining kindness to the Kilians, she suggested.
At a certain point, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult for discussions to take place after that.
Two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, objected to the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, he will offer Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Killin" and a chance "to end 139-year-old disputes with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - was using the maritime issue for political interests.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to understand that we must leave behind the former arms."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't be carried out for as long as it can't trust the United States.
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to clear nuclear weapons for as long as it cannot trust Washington.
New was talking on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during a summit in Singapore among the leaders of rival states.
His comments come at a time when the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be at the threshold of the resurrection of nuclear diplomacy so far "to beg", but three months after Singapore with Kim Jong Un in North Korea.
According to Ri, the hopes that the continued sanctions and US opposition to the declaration on the completion of the Korean War will make North Korea kneel down are vain hopes.
As long as Pyongyang doesn't act first to make important eviction movements, Washington hesitates to accept the statement.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is a widespread skepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang's goal to attract its arsenal, which the state most likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of giant chapels that will soon come to your city's streets
If you want to enrich your chapel collection or provide full protection from the sun's rays, don't ask for more.
Valentine’s and Thom Browne’s stylists presented a series of bizarre giant chapels for their SS19 collection on the platform, which left all the stylists open in Paris’s Fashion Week.
Very impractical chapels have been taken to Instagram this summer, and these stylists have brought their surprising creations to the fore.
Valentino’s special creation was a very extravaganced chapel, decorated with a wide shelter with details similar to dolls, which surrounded the model’s head.
Other large accessories included stone ornaments, a magic hat and even a pineapple -- but they are not made to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of odd - eyed masks for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sharp lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the leather coat.
One creature resembled the sinking equipment, filled with air tube and water glasses, while another resembled a molten iced stove.
And if you like to follow this brave way, you're lucky.
Fashion analysts predict that giant chapels can quickly come to your city’s streets.
The trend of giant chapels has followed that of La Bomba, the two-legged castle chapel we've all seen, starting from Rihanna and up to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult market that was hidden behind the chapel was so impractical that it was given through social media that another huge design was produced on the sidewalk — a bag of cash beach, almost as large as the model of the bathroom that was holding it.
The colorfully lit orange ruffin bag, decorated with cloth raffin and with a white handkerchief on top, was the most special creation of the collection La Riviera SS19 of Jacquemus in Paris’s Fashion Week.
The founder of famous personalities Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "The next summer I expect to see the chapels and bags of giant beaches in the streets of the cities - since the stylist has left such a big impact as it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large accessories".
John Edward: Essential linguistic skills for global citizens
Private schools in Scotland keep record of academic excellence and this has continued in 2018 with another set of excellent results in trials, reinforced further by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other fields.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), try to offer the highest level of service to their students and parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further higher education, for their chosen career and their country as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can prepare and implement an appropriate educational curriculum, we are witnessing how modern language branches continue to be a popular and popular choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language that he understands, your words will be heard.
If thou speak with him in thy tongue, thy words shall enter into his heart.
Those words are a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to establish relationships with people from foreign countries.
From the results of this year's recent trials, we can see that languages are leading the results list, with the highest grade of passing notes among private schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who have studied foreign languages have received the maximum note A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of students had received the maximum grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French, and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish had also received grade A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as one of the life skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, the foreign language branch is considered as important as the STEM branches (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematics) in the private school curriculums and beyond.
A 2014 study by the United Kingdom Commission for Employment and Skills found that among the main difficulties faced by employers in filling the countries concerned, 17 per cent of them related to the lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
With the addition of foreign - language jobs, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Despite a career chosen by a person, if he has learned a second language, he will have real advantages in the future, as master of such a long - term ability.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign people will automatically position a multilingual person over competitors.
According to a survey by YouGov, which included over 4,000 adults from the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 per cent of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to develop a conversation, and the French was the only foreign language spoken by a 2 - figure percentage, specifically 15 per cent.
That is why investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
The possession of many languages, especially the possession of developing countries' languages, will give children a better chance of employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different as to the languages taught in it.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will offer languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom in the 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages that you can choose in private schools, with pedagogical staff made up of field specialists.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to offering a school environment that will prepare children and will "arm" them with the necessary skills to succeed, however the future.
At this time, the fact that in a global business environment, languages continue to have a vital importance for the country's future must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be regarded as "international communications officer".
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for Scotland's young people.
It needs to be done.

LeBron is expected to debut with Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
It's almost over for fans waiting to see LeBron James in his first game for Log Angeles Lakers.
Lakers Coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening pre-season game on Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
Yet it is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"There will be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Lakers correspondent wrote on Twitter that James would probably play for a limited number of minutes.
After training early this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-season Lakers program.
"I don't need before the season in this phase of my career to prepare," he said.
Trump's Day in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump, starts a series of electoral meetings tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be the first meeting of five of these planned to be held next week, including stops in friendly areas including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of approval leaving the suspension for his election to fill the empty country in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to create support for future timely elections as Republicans risk losing control in Congress when the vote is held in November.
What time does Trump's gathering take place today in West Virginia, and how do we follow it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to take place at 7 p.m.. Eastern Time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump's meeting in West Virginia online below, through direct transmission to YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearing sessions at the Supreme Court of candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who was tensioned by charges of his inconvenient sexual behavior, with the expected vote of confirmation by the Senate for one week while the FBI conducted the case investigations.
But the primary objective of these many gatherings is to help the Republicans take a step forward in the November elections.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign staff said these five meetings next week aim to "give energy to volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority held in the Senate and in the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for his agenda, as the President will travel to as many states as possible as we address the thick season of the campaign," a Trump campaign spokesman, who did not want to be identified, told Reuters.
Planned to take place at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the gathering of this evening can bring back supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by the Pittsburg media," according to Western Virginia's Metro News Agency.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Senate candidate for Western Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has been behind the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a push in the poll," said Simon Hayer, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team showed willingness to fight while holding their hopes alive by running the competitions on Sunday
After three single seasons, the remaining four for the afternoon of Sunday, could be what this Ryder Cup needed.
This trick is a completely created sport concept, but a concept where players truly believe and never more than in such competitions.
But where can we say he's feeling this mess now?
"They had a six-point separation that has now gone to four, we can say that it has been created to some extent a sort of faith," Jordan Spieth said as he closed the day.
Of course, Europe has four points ahead, while remaining in the game and twelve points.
As Spieth states, Americans hope that the treasures are in their favor and have many things to encourage, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day when they took three of the four possible points.
Spyeth has been ruthless from the start of shooting to the grave and is leading by his example.
The festival’s brochures were added as the next round came, putting the golf ball in a easy hit to bring the match together, when he and Thomas were before two points down after two rounds.
His easy shot, which gave them the victory in the 15th hole, was expected with a similar brochure, which shows that he believes that the American team is not yet out - of - date.
"You just have to work hard and worry about your fight," Spieth said.
All the players left now.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players with more points than Spyth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple has accomplished four out of four and can't be wrong.
Moliwood was the only couple who didn't take a minimum shot on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided minimum shots on Sunday mornings, Friday evenings and the second nine shots on Friday mornings.
This result and the way their energy seems to flow towards the enthusiastic crowd and the Anasjella reinforces the idea that they are the players to be able to get on Sunday and that there will be no other player known more than Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory, as the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Probably both at the same time in different graves.
However, statements about a European triumph are still premature.
Baba Watson and Webb Simpson made it very easy for Sergio Garcia, the four - morning hero when he married Alex Noren.
One point on at least two to nine fronts put Spanish and Swedish in a pit from which they had no chance to leave.
However, no one will be there to help you get out of your grave on Sunday.
The games of the four and with the couple are so amazing to follow from close because of the interaction between the couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way in which a strategy can change for there.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead until the end, but these four sessions also showed that the US team will still be fighting, even though some people, especially Stateside, have decided on this.
Europe heads 10-6 as it goes toward the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a major advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup since it has come out of the four games and with couples with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspirational doubt Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the two-way race against a Tiger Woods who was in trouble to increase their advantage at four points in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, offered to take the trophy that he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the powerless American team in the two morning matches, bringing it to the 3-1 series of results.
The American team showed more resistance in the game four, winning two matches, but they could not reduce the difference.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to hold the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European first player to win four round points, while he and Molinari, who are attending the 'Mollwood', after a sensational ending, are the second couple in the history of the Ryder Cup winning four points in their four open matches.
After Drunk Woods and Patrick Reed in the game four, they combined quite well together to get a powerless Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with an even more dramatic result 5&4.
Woods, who had a hard time at two meetings on Saturday, showed temporary explosions of magnificence, but he has already lost 19 of his 29 matches in the game four and with couples and 7 consecutive matches.
Justin Rose, retired for the four-morning match, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the match with couples and received a 2+1 loss from Dustin Justin and Brooks Koepka - ranked in the first and third world.
Europe did not have everything in favor on a very beautiful and fresh day in the southwest of Paris.
Three times the professional winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas made the difference between being caught by Americans on two Saturdays.
They won a bold 2&1 victory against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter at the four matches and later returned to Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the match with couples after they lost in the first two pits.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team has returned the result after a difference between four points in individual games, even though the Fury's team has only needed an equation to keep the trophy.
However, since he was the second best player for two days, a protest on Sunday seems to go beyond their possibilities.
North Korea says it won't be shut down 'in no way' unilaterally without gaining faith
North Korea Foreign Minister told the United Nations that the continued sanctions on Saturday were deepening the mistrust of the United States, and the country would not give up its nuclear weapons in any way unilaterally in such circumstances.
New Yong Ho told the annual body from around the world of the General Assembly that North Korea has undertaken "significant measures showing good will" in the past year, such as the banning of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of nuclear testing areas, and pledgeing that it will not increase the arsenal of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we are not seeing any response to this from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, our national security will not have confidence and in these circumstances there is no way we can unify ourselves first."
While Rei reiterated North Korea's usual complaints regarding Washington's resistance to a separate approach to the nuclear disarmament process where North Korea would be assessed due to the gradual steps it has taken, his statement seemed important because it did not exclude the unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Penny had previously done.
The new was referring to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit held for the first time between a US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim was promised to work towards "the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump was pledged security related to North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought an official outcome of the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has said that Penny must first withdraw from nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften international severe sanctions on North Korea.
"The US insists that 'nuclear disarmament' be carried out initially and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal compulsorily, even by rejecting 'the declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can crush us is dreams in the sun of people who are uninformed of us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is deepening our disbelief."
New did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, a statement that US leader earlier stressed during this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae in the last five months, and added: "If you were dealing with the issue of nuclear disarmament would be South Korea and not the United States, the process of nuclear disarmament in the Korean Peninsula would not have come into this state without a way out."
Nevertheless, the tone used in the New Speech, was radically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly, that setting the US territory under target with the North Korean missiles was inevitable after "Mr. President Djalli" Trump called Kim "a rocket man" with a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year that he would "completely destroy" North Korea thanked Kim for the courage shown in taking steps to free up, but said there was still much work to do and that sanctions should continue to be active until North Korea carries out nuclear disarmament.
Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Penian for the interim steps.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without stopping until we realize the full and final verification of nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously determined the increase of sanctions for North Korea since 2006, in an effort to end the financing of the Kenyan nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri beyond at the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Penian again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeii has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go so well.
He left Pennsylvania in July saying he had made progress, and only within a few hours North Korea denouncing him that he had done "a mafias-style request."
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile zone and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take "relevant measures".
He said Kim had said that the "relevant measures" he was seeking were security guarantees for which Trump was promised in Singapore and moving towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students take lessons on how to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year has included all students to sleep more, in an effort to fight the growing culture of the study 'mass' through the use of caffeine from these 'pays'.
One academic observed that students at the number one university in the world often have no knowledge when it comes to basic things than how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Grave Hospital, prepared the course of lectures, which he believes is the first of this kind in the US.
He was inspired to take this course after giving a reference to the influence that sleep has on the teacher.
'At last, a girl came to me and said, 'Why is this telling me now, in my last year?'
She said no one had told her before about the importance of sleep -- which surprised me,' he said about 'The Telegraph'.
The course, included in the programme for the first time this year, explains to students the essential elements of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic rankings, and also how it improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of medical services at the university, said the university decided to present this course after finding that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The course that lasts an hour involves a number of interoperability responsibilities.
On the one hand, there is a view of a concussion room, where students click on the openings of the coffee, loses, athletes and books to explain to them the effects of caffeine and lighting and how athletic performance is affected by the lack of sleep, as well as the importance of the routine of hours to be spent in bed.
In another part, participants are explained as a sleep deprivation over a long period of time increasing the risk of heart attack, ischemia, depression, and cancer.
A map of the camp, with interactive icons, further encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know that student behaviors will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know, the health influence when you choose to smoke,' added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride to spend 'a crazy night' continues to exist, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students always meant that sleep deprivation was a permanent and growing problem.
The assurance that you have received enough sleep, of a good quality, must be the student's 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation leads to a hunger mode, making them feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old Californian study of physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to prepare the course, since he had participated in one of his classes last year in Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to return to a course for the entire camp.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all students of post-university studies to complete a similar study programme before joining competitive institutions.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students should set up one hour in a row when they should go to bed, and also when they should wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light coming from electronic screens and LED lighting, which can produce the biological pace of sleep out of work, which leads to problems in sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga marks against Gerrard's boys
Rangers received another hit as a visitor while Dolly Menga's hit gave Steven Gerrard's disbanded side lost 1-0 in Livingstone.
The Ibrox team was looking to record his first victory since the February 4-1 triumph in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused the second loss in 18 Gerrard matches as a coach, leaving his team eight points behind the fugitive leader of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Hearts team.
Menga scored seven minutes before finishing the first part and with a deployment of the Rangers team that seemed completely powerless to balance.
While Rangers now falls to the sixth, Livingstone climbs to the third and is directly behind Hibernian for a difference of goals.
Rangers may expect more trouble after their arm player Calum Spence was treated for a head hit after it was hit by an object probably thrown away by visitors.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team, which passed Air to the mid-finals of the Bethfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt, went into the same 11th field that took a point at Hearts last week and that he would be pleased with the way his well-organized team beat the opponents on every side.
Rangers may have dominated the hold of the ball, but Livingstone created more when he had it in possession.
They should have noted only two minutes from the start of the meeting, when the first pass that Menga gave Scott Pittman at the door square protected by Allan McGregor, was not exactly used by him by shooting the ball out.
A long cross from the execution of Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgov, just shot him out on the back of the gate.
Rangers took control of the game, but they seemed to be more hopeful than they really believed in their game in the opposing area.
Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a penalty after four hours of playing as he and Steven Lawless were beaten, but Arbitrary Steven Thomson did not listen to Colombian complaints.
Rangers managed to make two hits at the front door, but the former porter of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, did not worry about hitting Lassana Coulibally's head and hitting Ovie Ajaria's powerless.
While the first target of Liv in the 34th minute might have been contrary to what was being seen in the field, no one could deny that they deserved it only for the argument they showed.
Sir Rangers failed in the long-lasting service for Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball towards Scott Robinson, who kept quiet to pass Menga and to mark in a simple way.
Gerrard acted on the break between the parts while replacing Coulibally with Ryan Kent and this change for a little while did not give an immediate effect while the escort followed for Morelos, but the impression Kelly ran away from his position to block it.
But Livingston kept making guests play as they wanted, where Lithgow and Halkett followed each other long after.
Holt's team could have extended his leadership in the final phase, but McGregor stood firm and denied Jacobs before Lithgow shot out of a ball taken from hitting the song.
Ranger's deputy Glenn Middleton later claimed during the game for another penalty, while he was messing with Jacobs, but Thomson again allowed the advantage.
Almanac: Geiger's Mirror
And now a page from our almanac of "Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, As today 136 years ago and IN VAZHDIM... the day the next physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the production of what is known as Geiger’s measurement.
A major pillar of science since then, Mature Geiger has become a major pillar of popular culture as well, as in the 1950 film "The Coronado Days," with a cast of scientists noticing non-professionals like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger matt used to trace radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set these limits, you can really hear the effects of atoms released from radioactive activity into minerals."
Evans: "Don't tell me, I'm really listening now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system "to distinguish" the bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system "to distinguish" the bad cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory.
They can 'get out' a protein that weighs heavily on many types of cancer and then reinject.
A vaccine that is being tested is showing promising results in patients with certain types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells observed that ovary cancer has been eliminated for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them into laboratories so that they can "get out" a protein that is heavy in some types of cancer called HER2, and then reinjecting these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results show us that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "incentives the growth of some types of cancer," including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs, and breast cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to the withdrawal of immune cells from patients "to teach them" how to discover cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West appeared in a Pro-Trump rally, wearing a hood with the MAGA heading, after his show in SNL.
Don't go right.
Kanye West was greeted with studio protests during a broadcast at the "Saturday Night Live" issue, after a disappointed interpretation where he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for this post in 2020.
After interpreting his third song for that night called "Ghost Town", where he was holding a hat on his head writing "Make America Great", he followed us to speak with strong against the Democrats and refocused his support for Trump.
"When I talk to a white person and they tell me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America long ago," he said.
The SNL began the show with a parody in the role of Matt Damon, where Hollywood star played Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Judicial Commission on the charges of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, records of West's harsh speech were uploaded to social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear if Rock is trying to make fun of the West with that mail or not.
West also complained to the spectators that he had spent a difficult time in the back because of what he had put in his head.
"They abused me in the back.
They told me, 'Don't go on stage with that hat in your head.'
They treated me badly!
And then they tell me I'm grounded," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
And the West said, "Do you want to see the bottom line?" And he said, "I put my superior hat in my head, because it shows that no one can tell me what to do.
Prove love."
His comments were received at least twice by the spectators and members of the SNL cast seemed to be embarrassed, reports Variety, where a person told the newspaper: "All the studio fell silent."
West was called a late replacement instead of Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, Reperio Mac Miller, had changed his life a few days earlier.
The West surprised many with the interpretation of the song "I Love It", dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted on Twitter: "For one of the bravest spirits: THE RELATED TO THE BALK OF TURMUS."
But broadcast moderator Karen Hunter posted on Twitter that the West was just "self and this is extraordinary."
"But I choose MOS to reward someone (by buying music or clothing or by supporting his "art"), whom I believe is embarrassing and spreading ideology that is harmful to my community.
And he is free.
That's how we are," she added.
Before the show, the singer declared on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was already "the shadow that was formerly known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's tracks, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper friend, Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and also the late Prince musical legend, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist known as Prince.
Charge for attempted murder by knife at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was beaten with knife at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.

The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Service.
Star of 'Game of Thrones', Kit Harington, good toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a sword in the character of Jon Snow, in the violent series of medieval fantasy "Game of Thrones".
But 31-year-old actor has hit male hero stereotypes, saying the display of such roles on the screen makes young boys realize that they must act as strong to respect.
Speaking of 'The Sunday Times Culture', Kit said he believes that 'something has gone wrong' and was asked how the problem of toxic masculinity can be solved in the time of #MeToo movement.
Kit, who recently married his acting colleague at Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that he feels 'enoughly important' to resolve the issue.
'Personally I feel very important about this issue at the moment -- where did we fail to show masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grow up, in relation to the problems we are now facing?'
The kit believes that television may partly be responsible for increasing the toxic masculinity due to the excessive male characters appearing there.
He continued: 'What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and what is taught on the street, which makes young boys believe they have to behave in a certain way to feel men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time — how do we change this?
'Cause obviously something went wrong with the young boys.'
During the interview, he also admitted that he would no longer ride for "Game of Thrones" after the series ended at the end of next summer, saying that 'the cows and horses have come to the edge of the nose'.
As of November, Kit will participate in a recovery on the stage of 'True West' by Sam Shepard, which is the story of a film producer and his thief brother.
The actor finally showed that meeting with his wife Rose is the best thing he got from Game of Thrones.
'In this product I found my wife, we can say that this show gave me the next family and determined my life from now on,' he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the sentimental interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic-scientific winning series of ‘Emmy' prizes.
The couple married in June 2018 in the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/Sida: China reports growth by 14% of new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% of the population living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected throughout the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted through sexual relations, showing a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly to parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
But the number of people taking HIV through this way had almost gone zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has grown by 100,000.
The transmission of the HIV virus through sex is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people still prevails.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have measured that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry women.
Most of the transmission of the disease is due to inadequate protective measures during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to medical children for HIV treatment as part of an attempt to hit this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that GOP senators' data have been disseminated by staff members, says these are 'hazardous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'
US representative Maxine Waters reported Saturday claims that a member of her staff had posted personal information to the three US senators of the Republic on the legal pages of Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles democracy claimed that these claims were being pushed by experts and online pages of the "right extremism".
"Slanders, lies, and just disgusting lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The information is reported to include home addresses and phone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing session of the Senate panel on the wrong behavior with sexual nature against the candidate for the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The flow of information came shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Some of the conservative pages such as 'Gateway Pundit' and 'RedState' reported that IP addresses identifying the source of the publications linked to the Waters office and collected data from a staff member of the Waters, reports Hill.
"This baseless claim is totally false and a great lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff -- identity, personal information and security that has been compromised as a result of these false and alleged claims -- has not been in any way responsible for the outcome of this information.
This base claim is totally false and a great lie."
Waters' statement was immediately confronted with online criticism, including the former White House Press Secretary Ari Flescher.
"This denial becomes frustrating," Flescher wrote.
"That means she doesn't have the right temper to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, he shouldn't be nervous.
It shouldn't be provocative.
The defendant's motives should not be questioned.
He must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters' reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being very nervous during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to occupy Waters in the mid-term elections, also posted his statements on Twitter.
"Great truth, if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement Waters said her office had signaled "the relevant authorities and law enforcement institutions on these false charges.
"We will make sure the authors are discovered," she continued, "and they will take legal responsibility for all their actions, which have devastating and dangerous effects for anyone from my staff."
Review of the film "Johnny English Hits Again" - comedy with unequipped spy Rowan Atkinson material
It has been the case that in every new film with British influence, it is seen for hidden messages related to Brexit's theme, and this finds its implementation in the stream of comedy-action-action "Johnny English" - which has its beginnings in 2003 with "Johnny English" and its return in 2011 with "Johnny English Return".
Would this satirical code reveal how clearly inadequate we are in connection with the new national export opportunities?
In any case, the person with the eye of the country, with his face as a doll, and apparently Johnny English's guardian, has been given permission to confuse things for the second time -- his name, which shows more than anything else that he is a broad comical creature for non-English-speaking territories, but frequenting cinematics.
Of course, he is a poor secret agent, who, despite his curious claim to appear as a magician, has little from Inspector Clouseau, a few from Mr. Bean's character, and a portion of that guy who contributed only to the release of a sound in the song 'Chariots of Fire' at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games - London 2012.
It is also based on mystery man, traveler and international Atkinson, who used to play on television commercials that are now forgotten by ‘Barclaycard’, leaving the country in chaos wherever it was.
There's one or two nice moments at this movie's premiere.
I liked him very much when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in a medium - sized parsam, and the helical speech was a little stuck in his helmet.
Here is the gift of the physical committee that Atkinson performs, but humor seems to be too much and sometimes too heavy, especially when the 'series' films like 007 and the Unmundated Mission have even added little comedy as an ingredient in their films.
Humor seems to address children more than adults, and Johnny English's crises are not so creative and are focused on voiceless movements, the same as what Atkinson does in Bean's character.
The permanent theme, as well as in this film, is the fact that Britain and the Great are in serious danger.
A cyber hacker has been infiltrated into the super-secret network of British agents, discovering the identity of British ground agents and delegating the agent into duty -- unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last chance for a prime minister who appears as a possum and ready for battle, who is already suffering from an extraordinary political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing the best to realize the character that Teresa May looks like, but there's not much text on the screen that she can play.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that every active spy is compromised, she will have to rely on someone who retired.
And that means choosing yourself Johnny English, who was now employed as a school director in a high-level neighborhood, but who was informally teaching how to become a secret agent: here there are beautiful scenes, because English is offering a spying academy in the form of a rock school.
English again calls Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunites with his former assistant, the multi-purpose Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, linked to a undercover captain, in the role of a high-level girl, where Vicky Pepperdine has used a little mistake in this role.
So Batman and Robin's doing things completely back in His Majesty's Secret Service are again in action, fighting with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletin played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is enchanting by the attractive billionaire of technology who claims to be able to solve the difficulties of British computers: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their ridiculous and dismal clothes: masked as cameras, set fire to a beautiful French restaurant; cause chaos as they enter the luxury island of Volta; and English is totally disturbed as they try to use the virtual reality equipment to get to know the interior parts of Volta's house.
All the sequences are usually made for the final stage, but despite it's fun and noisy, everything seems a little like a movie for kids.
Pretty moderate stuff.
As in the other Johnny English films, I couldn't imagine: doesn't the British film industry have a role for Rowan Atkinson that would suit his talent?
The Labour Party denies that there is a plan for British workers to work four days a week, but pay for five days
The Labour Party led by Jeremy Corby is considering a radical plan that would make British work four days a week -- but pay for five.
The party is reported to want companies' heads to save using artificial intelligence revolution (AI) for employees, giving them an extra day's rest.
We would see workers enjoying a weekend with three days of rest — but continuing to drive home the same route.
Sources said the idea would be "coupled" with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country into a favour to employees.
Spending a week at work for four days is an idea that has been embraced by the Congress of the Trade Unions, as a way for employees to benefit from the changing economy.
A high-level source of the Labour Party said 'The Sunday Times': 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'There isn't to be immediate, but a four-day job week is an aspiration that matches the party's approach to balancing the economy in favour of employees as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to embrace this idea, where the Green Party has previously pledged a week of work during the campaign of general elections in 2017.
However, this aspiration is currently not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A spokesperson of the Labour Party said: 'One week with four days of work is not party policy and is not taken into account by the party.'
The Chancellor in Hye, John McDonnell, used the last week's conference of the Labour Party to channel his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to transfer power from the "anonymous directors" and "beneficiaries" to public service firms.
The shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders in the water companies may not take all their shares back, because the Labour Government can carry out 'draft' by reasoning the actions considered as a breach.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on the board of companies and to create the Property-Inclusive Funds to pass to employees 10 percent of the capital of private sector firms, which means a paid dividend per year up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy shows in "60 Minutes", if the FBI's investigation on Kavanaugh could change their mind
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment in the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises questions as to whether findings from the investigation bureau may affect any Republican senator to draw his support.
In an interview that will be broadcast on Sunday, the 60-minute correspondent, Scott Pelley, asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his college from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said that when I was entering the hearing session, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I got it on the phone after this happened, so after the allegations came out and I said, "Have you done this?"
He was determined and clear."
Graham's vote, however, seems to be carved into stone.
"I've cut my mind off Brett Kavanaugh and the change would only make a bomb charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone she mentioned couldn't verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything going to change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has done anything to put poverty down?
This Saturday, New York will organise the "Global Citizen" Festival, an annual musical show that contains a large and impressive list of stars that interpret and also have a mission as impressive; to end poverty in the world.
Now, in his seventh year, the "Global Citizen" festival will meet thousands of people in the "Great Lawn" in the Central Park who not only enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mindes' interpretations, but also to be aware of the true purpose of the show, to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of lawyers, who hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to benefit from a free ticket for the show (except when you want to pay a VIP ticket), participants must perform a number of tasks, or "act" as voluntary work, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful way that would help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been when they have remained 12 years to achieve its goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert work a real way to convince those who are looking for these interventions, or is it just another case of what is known as "activism with clicks" -- people who feel they're making a real change by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, "Global Citizen" has been said to have registered more than 19 million "activities" from its supporters, giving them a push for different purposes.
It is said that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to declare $37 billion worth of political commitment, which is said to affect lives with more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and declarations as a result of the group's actions, where at least 10 billion dollars have already been distributed or secured as funds.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have had a direct impact on some 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main promises include "The Power of Nutrition", an investment partnership and implementing agencies based on the United Kingdom, committed to "help children grow up with their full potential," promising them to give Rwanda $35 million to help end the country's mishap, after receiving more than 4700 "citizens" from the activists of "Global Citizen".
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can turn social injustice into a memory of the past," the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition told the crowd at a concert directly in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking 5,000 actions to call on the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for children's mothers, the government declared funding for a project, "The Power of Nutrition", which will affect 5 million women and children who need food intervention.
In an answer to the most frequent questions on their website, where they ask, "What makes you believe that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as every high civil right and as the movement against apartheid before us, we shall go forth, for together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the actors who will play at this year's show in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US can use the Navy for "blocks" to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
"If necessary," Washington may rely on his Marine to prevent Russian energy from falling into the market, including the Middle East, has discovered US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner's quote.
Zinke claims that Russia's involvement in Syria -- particularly where it is operating at the invitation of the Syrian legitimate government -- is a pretext to explore for new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to supply it with energy as they do with Eastern Europe, the southern beard of Europe," he reported.
And according to this official, there are ways to deal with this problem.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the waterways are open and, if necessary, to block them, in order to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing participants in an activity developed by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a non-profit organization that has personalized itself as "the capture of energy consumers" in the US.
He continued to compare Washington's approach to Iran's Russia, pointing out that these approaches are practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is a little more exploitation and replacement of fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as "a fraud" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements come after Trump administration has undertaken a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, thus replacing Russia, a much more free option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project of the "Nord Stream 2" newspaper, which according to Trump, has turned Berlin into a "rob" in Moscow.
Moscow has consistently stated that the $11 billion project of the North Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is claimed to double the existing gas pipeline capacity to bring it to 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
Kremlin argues that the hot opposition of the project from Washington is simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the same view that energy cannot be a tool used for pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose the furnace," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has been opposed by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to this project.
The main organisation for industry in Germany, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has asked the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a lot of problems when a third state intervenes in our energy supply," Dieter Kemp said, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a meeting recently between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously think" if he will run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that he would "seriously think" participating in the race for president after the mid-term election.
During a meeting in the city of Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider the candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and regulate our destroyed government, and this involves putting a woman on top," she said according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will take the presidential candidate seriously."
Warren hit President Donald Trump during the gathering in the city, saying he "is taking the country to the wrong direction.
"I'm terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is known for her criticism of Trump and his candidate for the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a poll Friday, Warren said "we certainly need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll released Thursday showed that much of Warren's voters themselves do not think it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of Masacuset's "possible" voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by Suffolk/Boston Globe University Political Research Centre.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The poll showed that former governor Deval Patrick enjoyed greater support for candidates, where 38 percent supported his possible candidacy and 48 percent opposed this candidacy.
Other high profile democratic names that have been discussed to compete in 2020 include former-zv./president, Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, reported 'Associated Press'.
Sarah Palin quotes Trak Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after being called to the military in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with an incident of violence in the family
"What my son is going through, what he's experiencing after he's back, can connect him to other families that feel the spread of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are returning with," she told participants in a gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "come a little changed, hardened, wondering if they get the proper respect of the military soldiers and other aviators, for what they have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence after an attack on a woman, after a report of domestic violence and armed violence while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Police Department in Wasilla.
18 states, D.C. support opposition to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Colombian District are supporting a legal opposition to a new American policy that denies asylum to victims who have survived criminal or family violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the circuit deposited an explanation document as a court-martial in Washington on Friday, in support of the change in asylum-seeker policies, NBC News reports.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace case against the Session that the American Union of Civil Liberties has deposited in August against federal policy has not been discovered.
She said her partner "and his violent gang members," abused her, but US officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20th.
She was banned in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries that produce a high number of asylum-seekers in the United States because they are states that have problems with gangs and domestic violence.
New asylum-seek policy in the US, a decision, in 2014, came back from the Emigrant Appeals Board, which allowed migrants without documents to save family violence and apply for asylum.
Colombia's District Attorney General, General Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "innocents all decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal laws require all asylum requirements to be judged according to the particular facts and circumstances of the case, and such a measure conflicts with this principle," the court-martial's report said.
The lawyers further argued in the report that the police's ban on the entry of immigrants was damaging the American economy, stating that their dimensions are to become entrepreneurs and "furnish the necessary labour force."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the judges of immigration in June to stop the victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Assisi is available to those who leave their country because of fear or persecution based on race, religious belief, nationality or belonging to a certain group of social or political beliefs," the Session said on June 11th, on the day of the political declaration.
Asylum has never been meant to ease all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death’s balance doubles in a race to find survivors
In the case of survivors, the situation was very honorable.
"The situation feels quite tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while keeping her little and sick boy at an evacuation centre in the destroyed city of Palusa.
"The ambulatory brings the troops every minute.
There's no clean water anymore."
The inhabitants saw that they would return to their ruined houses, throwing their stuff into the water, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 - member earthquake are overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Harris, who had broken his back and shoulder, were placed at the Military Hospital outside of Palus, where patients are being treated in the external environment because the earth’s earthquakes continue.
His eyes filled with tears as he recalled the violent shaking of the earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was pushed under the ruins of the wall," Harris told 'Associated Press', adding that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
"I heard the woman was crying and asking for help, but then silent.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accused China for 'gacmism' with 'propagandistic advertising'
A week after a Chinese official newspaper posted a four-page advertisement on a daily American where the common commercial benefits of the US-China trade were being disseminated, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread its propaganda.
US President Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to the "China Daily" supplement in the "Des Moines Register" -- the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa -- after accusing China of attempting to intervene in the US Congress elections held on 6 November, an accusation rejected by China.
Trump's allegations that Beijing was trying to intervene in US elections noted what US officials said to Reuters was a new phase in Washington's stepped-up campaign to increase China's pressure.
While it is normal for foreign governments to set up advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embedded in a growing trade war that has seen a level playing field on imports of one another.
Chinese and American experts have said China's ransom rates in this trade war were set to hit exporters in states like Ioua, who supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former governor for a long time in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit US workers, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion published on 'Des Moines Register' Sunday, Branstad wrote that, "China is already doubling this harassment by placing propaganda advertising in our free press."
"Since it spreads its propaganda, the Chinese government is being helped by the happy American tradition of free speech and free press by setting up a pay-for advertising in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in newspapers' kiosks on the road here in Beijing, you will find very few votes against and you will not see any real reflection of the different thoughts that Chinese might have on China's worrying economic tractor, since the media is under strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent newspapers in China, avoided the offer to publish his article," even though he did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn that Republicans are changing voters before elections in the middle of the mandate after the Kavanaugh scandal
The more major characters of Republicans to solidarity and defend the candidate for the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in front of some allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will face a severe reaction particularly from women in the next elections in the middle of the mandate.
Emotions on this topic have been very high, and many republics have publicly declared that they want to continue voting on the candidate.
These things can't be gone," Grant Reeher, professor of political sciences at the Syracuse University 'Scholl Maxwell told 'The Hill' about a published article on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts the last minute's attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation and that this would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Grates will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it either tomorrow or November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior and national speaker for the Progressive Group 'MoveOn', said Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors sang 'Nentor is coming!' while demonstrating in the Senate corridors while the Republicans in control of the Judicial Committee decided to move ahead with Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported 'Mic'.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach May," news page Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, said.
"People are saying that it has already been at high levels; that is true.
But it may be even higher, especially among unestablished voters of women in the area and among young voters, aged 18 to 29 years, who, although they do not like the president, usually do not vote at all."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her charges of sexual assault against the candidate of the High Court, analysts suggested that there would be a severe reaction if Republicans continued to support this candidacy.
"This has turned into a horrendous dispute for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Committee of Republicans, at the beginning of last week, according to the 'NBC News'.
"It's not just the committee's vote or the final vote, or if Kavanaugh is to be decided or not in the accused's bank, it's also about the way the Republicans have dealt with the issue and the way they have treated that woman," NBC News, Guy Cecil, U.S. Priorities Director, said, a group that helps in selecting the Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe in watching the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with the latter having a slightly higher support.
A recent survey by ‘YouGov’ shows that 41 per cent of respondents believe in doubt or with much possibility of Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent say they believe in doubt or with much possibility Kavanaugh.
Also, 38 per cent believe that Kavanaugh has probably lied during his testimony, and only 30 per cent say the same about Ford.
After Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating claims submitted by Ford as well as by the other accused, Deborah Ramirez, reports ‘The Guardian’.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee, sworn that Kavanaugh attacked him at the age of 17 while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the High Court, appeared his genital organs before her while they were at a party during the time they studied in Yale, 80's.
World Wide Network Creator plans to launch a new Internet to compete on Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Network, is creating a company that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, 'Inrupt,' is a company built by Berners-Lee's open-source platform called 'Solid'.
‘Solid’ allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons are allowed to have access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview for 'Fast Company,' Berners-Lee joked that the purpose behind 'Inrupt' is "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said about this innovative company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create "save their personal data on the network" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, mailing lists, music lists, and other personal and professional tools.
It's the same as having access to a browser and at the same time Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify.
What is unique for storing personal data on the network is the fact that it remains entirely in the user's hands about which kind of information will be accessed.
The company calls this "personal power through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the executive director of the company, John Bruce, is to bring together the resources, processes and skills necessary to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted developers to work on this project, and a voluntary coding community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team aren't talking to Facebook and Google if they have to present or not a total change where all their business models are completely flooded during the night.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post to the 'Medium' published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt mission "is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he founded the World Wide Network Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Even as Inrupt is founded, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Consortium of the World Wide Network, the Network Foundation and the Open Dating Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating the Victorian Cross during World War I for the clergy
The only clergyman who won a Victorian Cross during World War I in the qualities of the warrior has been remembered in his homeland, 100 years later.
Colonel Bernard Vann, honored, won the medal on September 29, 1918, in the attack in Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, and he never learned that he had won the highest British military title.
A memorial stone was presented by his two grandchildren in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the memorial was displayed exactly 100 years from the heroic act that gave the medal to his grandfather.
According to 'London Gazette', on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through Saint Quentin's channel "through a heavy mist and under the crack of bullets from the fields and mitrals."
He then rushed to the line of fire and with a "great third" turned the battalion forward and caught one of the weapons in the field and killed only three of them from the opposing troops.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions "are something he can never achieve but something that really shows modesty."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, were appointed by a choir behind the parade, which was directed by the 'Brentwood Imperial Youth' group.
Michael Vann said that "he felt quite honored that he was part of this parade" and added that "the value of a real hero is being shown by the support being given by many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night smart to follow Bellator 206, but instead they saw "Derrkukucen Pepa"
Imagine, you've been up all night awake to see Bellator 206, and then you're taken away the opportunity to see this major event.
The show by San Jose contained 13 matches, including six fights in the basic package and will be displayed in real time during the night at channel 5, at the MB.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Moussas and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, viewers in Britain were surprised when the transmission changed to show Derrkuzen Pepa.
Some remained unhappy after staying awake all night until the first hours, especially for this match.
A fan on Twitter described this passage from the game in a child video game as "a nasty joke."
"It is the government's rules that determine that at 6 o'clock that content was not suitable for and we should move on to a children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, vice-president of marketing and communication in Bellator, when asked for transmission.
""Derrkukija Pepa," after."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they will work on programming to include viewers from Britain in the future.
"When I think of the retransmission, I think we can solve it," Coker said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning, Sunday and Sunday, and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday with our hour, so Monday with their hour.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were lots of messages that were circulating, and none of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you there will be no next time.
We'll do the show with 5 matches instead of six -- as we usually do -- we're trying to give them more for fans and maybe we're overcrowded.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'low' about his sexuality
The Olympic janitor, Tom Daley, says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality -- but this gave him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went to nine-year-old school that "not all were like me."
Speaking first on Radio 4 'Desert Island Discs,' presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he raised the voice for homosexual rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that after becoming a parent, he thought less about winning Olympic medals.
The permanent chairman of the long-term programme, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off because of his illness.
Appearing as an isolated person in the first Laverne program, Daley said that as he grew up he felt "inferior" to others because "he was not acceptable on the social side to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings of inferiority, and the fact that I felt different, have been the real elements that gave me the push and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that it was worth "something," he said, not to disappoint everyone when they heard about his sexual orientation.
Twice the winner of the bronze Olympic medal, is already a high profile LGBT activist with a high profile and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to legitimize homosexuality.
He said he came out because he felt fortunate that he was able to live open and without consequences and that he wanted to give others "hope."
The world's champion said three times that the fall in love with a man - American movie producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "has caught me unprepared."
Last year, Daley married the Oscar prize winner, who is 20 years older than he, but said the difference at age was never a problem.
"When he lives so many things in such a new age," he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone at the same age that he had experienced the same low-up.
The couple became parents in June, a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "all prospects" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all I thought was 'I should win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name his father had, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with cancer in his head.
Daley said his father didn't admit he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if we had ready tickets for London in 2012 -- because he wanted to be in the first line.
"I couldn't tell 'that you couldn't be in the first row of Dad," he said.
"I was holding my hand as he left to breathe and only after the rest to breathe and changed his life I accepted for the first time that he was not inseparable," he said.
Next year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
"I knew this was the one I had dreamed of all my life--to dive in front of the local audience in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first musical selection -- Proud by Heather Small -- which has accompanied him during the preparations for the Olympic Games and continues to cause the Navy.
Desert Island Discs is given on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15, British hour.
Mickelson, out of shape, left at the table on Saturday at Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th match at Ryder Cup, but he will have to change his form so that he doesn't turn this historic moment into disappointment.
Mickelson, for which it is the 12th time that participates in this event, a more self-record, organized every two years, was left on the table by Captain Jim Furyk, during the two games (fourballs and foursomes).
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has usually been the case with the United States, the winner of the big headlines five times spent the day supporting the team and working with hope of leaving behind the concerns.
Not among the players with the right hit even when he was at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not a suitable player for the complicated Le Golf National field, where long and difficult fields do not allow for wrong shooting.
And if it wasn't just the fear of the field, Mikkelson, on Sunday, at the ninth match, will face the British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who has formed a team with beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win their four matches this week.
If Americans, who have four points less, start 12 tech matches before they start, start a tough start, the Mikkelson game can be decisive.
Fury expressed confidence in his player, although he could not say more than that.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a kick to the shoulders, put his hand on my neck and told me it would be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
"He has a lot of faith in himself.
He's in the Familiar Hall and he's made a lot of contributions to these teams last week, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two matches.
I had been thinking more, but that was the end of it, and we thought it was the solution.
He wants to be in the field, like anyone else."
Sunday, Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the player with more performances at Ryder Cup matches.
He may mark the end of his career in Ryder Cup, where he has not been at the height of his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven equations, even though Furyk said his presence brings value to the team.
"He's a fireman, sarcastic, sharp, he likes to mock people, and he's a fantastic boy to have in the team room," he explained.
"Also, I think the younger players were playing with him during this week, and that was nice to see.
He gives more than just a game."
Captain Thomas Bjorn of Europe knows that the great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, Europe's captain, knows from experience that the considerable lead ahead of the last day of the tech games in Ryder Cup can be turned into a dissatisfaction factor.
Danes made his debut in front of the year 1997, in Valderrama, where the team with Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead against the Americans and closed the tournament by winning with a very narrow difference, 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
"Recalls ourselves that we had a great lead in Valderrama; we had a great lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won but with great difficulty," said Bjorn, who was photographed after having won 5-3 in 'Class 2018' on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 in 'Le Golf National'.
So history tells me and everyone on that team that it's not over.
Tomorrow we'll walk with the last march.
We'll go there and do the right thing.
Nothing's finished until we get the points on the table.
We have a goal, try to win this trophy, and here's our focus.
I've said it all the time, I'm focused on the 12 players we have on the team, but we're aware of who we have - the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the ranking of his players, in a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to rush in this phase.
Tomorrow, we will face another “congregation. ”
Individual performances appear tomorrow, and that's something else to do.
It's great when you're in the field with a partner, when things go well, but when you're alone, then you try your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to follow to the players, tomorrow you need to give the best of yourself.
Now, forget the partner as he should go and give the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will expect his players to perform better individually than with partners, where only Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas took three of four possible points.
Furyk himself has experienced two cases of major returns of the result on the last day, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing what is considered the "Miracle in Medina" of the team of Europe.
"I remember every word," when asked how he had motivated his players during the last day, Captain Ben Crenshaw, in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we need to have a good start, as seen in Brooklyn and Medina.
When you take a turn on one arm, you put a lot of pressure on the middle of the game.
We set up the training based on this and we're going to get the boys into the ranking we believe is better, as you know, we're trying to realize a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has the duty to start the twisting of the result and will face Rory McIlroy at the main match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter with European players in the first half of the ranking
"I have chosen this group and in this order I believe that it covers all the way in competition," Bjorn said about his tech choices.
The production of the new German war is being reintroduced
The new German naval frigate should have been sent in 2014 to replace the cold wartime fights, but will not be ready until at least next year due to the problem systems and high costs, local media have reported.
The "Reinland-Pfalz" shipment, the main new ‘Baden-Wuerttemberg-class' freighter, has been launched by the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper 'Die Zeit' quoted by a military speaker.
The ship had to join Marina in 2014, but the problems after the shipment damaged the fate of the ambitious project.
Four ‘Baden-Wuerttemberg-class’ ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will serve as substitutes for the old ‘Bremen-class’ rails.
As it is known, it will contain a powerful ball, a series of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-aircrafts and steel technology, such as reduction of detection from radar, red crime and acoustic waves.
Some of the other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible for new frigates to be moved for more than two years away from the country's ports.
However, the ongoing delays mean that the fights of the latest technology - which are said to enable Germany to reflect power abroad - will be old at the time they enter the service, says 'Die Zeit'.
The F125 frigate came out on the first page last year, when the German Navy officially rejected the order for this ship and returned it to the shipping office of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that Marina returned a ship to her builder after the surrender.
A little information was given about the reasons for the return, but the media in Germany quoted as being a series of "great software and hardware defects" that made the ship useless during a war mission.
The programming problems were particularly important in the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships because they will be operated by a team of 120 sailors -- as much as half the working force of the old ‘Bremen Class’ rails.
It was also discovered that the ship was very overweight, reducing its ranking and limiting Marina’s ability to improve in the future.
"Reinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tonnes is believed to be twice the weight of similar category ships used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to the physical parts of problems, the cost of the whole project -- including team training -- is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it has reached a figure to leave without a word of €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - of the €2.2 billion initially predicted.
The problems that have stuck the new frigates become particularly important following recent warnings that the power of the German navy is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defence Committee in the German parliament, admitted that Marines are "completing appropriate ships to move to another country."
The official said that the problem had been increased over time because the old ships had been removed from use but were not replaced with new ones.
He said with regret that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg-class's new frigates would be able to join the Navy.
The National Trust Observes the Secret Life of Night's Curtains
A new research being carried out by a company in the mountainous areas of Scotland is aimed at discovering how night and night wetlands use land to hunt for food.
New findings are expected to shed new light on the behavior of single flying mammals and to help protect activities in the future.
A study by scientists in the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual night larks and those called soprano pipistrelles as well as the long-haired coffee and larks Daubenton in the Inverewe gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed at key points throughout the area to track night liqueur activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct field studies using hand detectors.
An analysis of the sounds to be performed by experts for all recordings will determine the frequency of the night’s scarring sounds and what each species is doing.
Then a report and a map of their habitat will be prepared to give a detailed overview of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Protection Adviser for NTS, hopes that the outcomes will show which habitats are most important for nightlifes and how they are used by each species.
This information would help to determine the benefits of local administration, such as the cultivation of crops and how to preserve forests for nightlifes and other species related to them.
The number of nightmares in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has fallen significantly during the last century.
They are under threat of building and developmental work that has an impact on folate and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose risks, such as mounting cards or chemical components of building materials, as well as domestic animal attacks.
Indeed the night’s darkness is not blind.
However, because of their hunting habits during the night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching and waiting.
They use a sophisticated tracking technique through the sounds to accurately determine insects and obstacles during flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is taken very seriously with nightlights.
There are ten trained experts who conduct regular studies, speech inspections, and sometimes included in rescue programs.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve in Scotland dedicated to night larks in Thraeve, Dumfries, and Galloway, which serves as a home for eight out of ten species of night larks in Scotland.
The administrator of this reserve, David Thompson, says this country is an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Thraeve we have a great area for nightlights," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the right habitat.
But there's still a lot of things about the night's larks that remain unknown to the work we do here and in other countries will help us understand more than they need to be 'develied'."
He stresses the importance of carrying out checkups for laurel at night before carrying out property maintenance work because there is a chance that the relentless destruction of a talk can kill up to 400 laurel nights of women and young people, thus destroying the entire population of an area.
Night's tears are protected and killing, their harassment and concern or the destruction of their speech is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish worker near the Night’s Lacuritian Trust, encourages people to become part of the relief effort.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our nightlife and many of our species, we just don't know how their people are moving."
Ronaldo denies charges of rape while lawyers prepare to indict the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the charges of rape against him are "false news," saying that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to indict the German news magazine "Der Spiegel", which published these charges.
Portugal's and Juventus' attacker has been accused of rape by an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that he was later claimed to have paid that $375 000 so he wouldn't talk about the incident.
Speaking in a live video in Instagram, directed 142 million followers, just a few hours after the publication of these claims, Ronaldo, 33, considered reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What he said today, false news," the Golden Cup winner told the camera five times.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's going well," the player added smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to indict 'Der Spiegel' for these charges, which they have called "unacceptable reports of suspicions about private life,".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "the moral damage of the value corresponding to the seriousness of the breach, which is perhaps one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009, at a Palms Hotel and Casino site in Las Vegas.
According to the documents presented at the Clark District Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have gone to the player's room, where he is alleged to have raped him in annus.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell into the knees after the alleged incident and said "99 per cent" he is a "good boy" left in the mud by "one per cent."
The document says Ronaldo confirms that the couple had committed sexual intercourse but that it was with the acceptance of both sides.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that she had photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed on a solution outside the court because she was "horrified by the prosecution" and that she was concerned that she would "suffer publicly."
The 34-year-old says he is now trying to reverse the deal because it continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was near the union with Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he passed to the Italian youth giants in a 100m-euro deal.
Brexit: United Kingdom will "repent forever" for losing the status of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "will repent forever" if it loses the status of world leader in the production of cars after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "disquieting" that Toyota in the United Kingdom had told the BBC that if Britain would leave the EU without an agreement, the company would temporarily ban production in its factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the border, in the event of unagreed exit, would cost job losses.
The factory in Burnaston, which produces models Toyota Auris and Avenis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"In my judgment, if Britain comes from the EU at the end of March, we will stop production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's administrative director in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the US, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed fear of leaving the EU without agreements and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW said after Brexit would close its Mini series factory for a month.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers refer to as the risk of the supply chain in the case of a Brexit without agreements.
Toyota's production line works on the basis "as soon as they order," part of which comes every 37 minutes from American and EU suppliers for order cars.
If, on March 29th, MB comes out of the EU without an agreement, there may be delays in the limit that this industry may be able to lead to delays and missing parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory more than a day in her factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and to produce it would stop.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's 'Checkers' plan for future relations with the EU "has been built specifically to avoid these border controls."
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the moment so that we can also use this option," he said for the Today program at BBC Radio 4.
"The data, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, show that we must certainly be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain."
Toyota could not determine how long it would stop production, but in the long term, warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and consequently lead to job reduction.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and who is the senior official of the U.S. union in the factory, said that members are becoming increasingly concerned: "according to my experience when these countries close, they don't return.
A government spokesman said, "We have set a clear and reliable plan for our relationship with the EU in the future."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be pushed back, White House says
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be "further for a week" after continuing the fight for High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's election interventions, the links between Trump and Russia's staff and the possibility that the president has obstructed justice.
The debate on whether Trump will discharge or not the Deputy Attorney General's duties, thus endangering Mueller's independence, is something that has been created for months in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein took into consideration the setting of a listener to record talks with Trump and the possibility of downloading the president through Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, among the reports that he was close to giving up.
A meeting with Trump, which was held in the United Nations headquarters in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he "would prefer" not to discharge Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to avoid a clash with the hearing session held by the Senate judicial committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testified, one of the women who accused him of immoral conduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, further pushing the full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was present today at Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "It's not yet a date, it could be this week, and I think it could take another week considering anything else that's going on with the Supreme Court.
But let's see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists may object to this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Moderator Chris Wallace raised the question of why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences did not result in dissatisfaction with the position of TV journalists, although she said: "I will not deny the fact that they draw attention."
Later, she let it be understood that direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
"The president conducts more quality assurance sessions than any other president before him," she said, adding, without quoting data: "We have seen these figures."
There will continue to be a press conference, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to question directly the President of the United States, then it is much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this often and you've seen that we've done it often in the last few weeks, replacing press conferences in cases where you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or at a press conference with important personalities.
Individual press conferences are rare.
The president may have shown the reason for this, during this week, in New York, where he made a controversial statement and in some strange cases, in front of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland about fear of Brexit
The Health Secretary has written EU staff working in NHS in Scotland to express appreciation for the country's name and desire to remain behind Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, the Scottish parliament's MP, has sent a letter, when more than six months have passed since the MB removal from the EU.
The Scottish government has already taken over the cost of applying for the status of permanent residence for EU citizens working in public services at local level.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, the negotiations for leaving the EU have continued, drawing near to making a decision in autumn.
However, the US government has also intensified its preparations in the case of an unagreed scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
For this reason, I wanted to stress how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that grow and improve the health service work, increasing the benefits of the patients and communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay here very much."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes an emergency surgical intervention after the head injury
Tennessee Ombudsman State Tigers Christian Abercrombie was subjected to an immediate surgical intervention following the damage to the injured head on Saturday, in the 31-27 loss against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported The Tennessee journalist Mike Organ.
Tennessee Coach State Rod Reed told reporters that the damage occurred just before the first part.
"He came to the side and fell there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen in the side line before putting it in the bar and sending it for further examinations.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville that Abercrombie had completed surgery at the Vanderbilt Hospital Centre.
Harris added that "there is still no detail on the type/grade of damage" and Tennessee State is trying to understand when the damage happened.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five interventions on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing him to 18 total numbers of interventions during the season.
Foreign browsers will pay the highest bill when they buy a property in MB
Foreign browsers will pay the highest bill for buying a property in the U.S. and additional money will be used to help the homeless according to the new Conservative Party's Tory plans
This move will neutralise the success of Corby's initiative to attract new voters
Pulse tax will be applied to those who don't pay taxes in MB
The treasure department expects to gather up to GBP 120m a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will pay the highest bill for buying a property in the US and additional money will be used to help the homeless.
This move will be seen as an effort to neutralise Jeremy Corby's initiative's success to attract new voters with promises to provide more affordable shelter and to "get under target" high-income people.
The ticket tax will apply to individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the US, while additional money will support the government's initiative to combat the lack of shelter.
This extra rate -- which adds the current tax of the chicken, including the increase of the tatium scale presented two years ago for the second houses and the properties purchased to rent -- could go up to three per cent.
The Thessar's department predicts that this move will accumulate up to GBP 120m a year.
About 13 per cent of London's last-built property is purchased by non-MB residents, which causes price increases and makes it more difficult to find shelter from buyers for the first time.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in capitals - have returned to "fantasm cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
This new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax reduction to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of holding high prices buying land but not putting into use, and called on Mrs. May to give up quotas for facing houses, in order to regulate "british turf with property."
Mr. Corby has proposed some attractive reforms for shelter, including rent control and "unreasonably" removals.
He also wants to give more power to counsel on building new homes.
Ms. May said, "Last year I declared that I would dedicate the mandate of the prime minister of the British dream recovery -- so, for a better life for every new generation.
And that means we're going to fix the problem market in our homes.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right for individuals who do not live in the United States and foreign societies to buy homes more easily than British workers.
For many people, a dream to own a house has done something very difficult to achieve and injustice to the homeless is more than real."
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to train Scotland'
Sunderland Coach Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's coach at a certain stage.
Scottish, 42, is enjoying the challenge of the rise of the north-eastern club, which is currently located in the third place in League One (third category), three points away from the head.
He came this summer at the Light Stadium after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish League in the past season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was once introduced to representative B and just so," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sportssound.
"But as a child I grew up seeing Scotland many times in Hampden with my father, and it's something that has always drawn me.
However, this option will only come if I am successful in leading clubs."
Ross' predecessors in the direction of Sunderland include Dick Advocates, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former coach Alloa Athletic says he is not concerned that he is following the steps of these great names in such a big club, since he has previously refused offers from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"For now, my success will depend on the fact that 'can I return this team to Prime Minister League?'
Given the structure and environment of this club, it certainly has the place in Prime Minister League," he said.
"It's not a simple task to go there, but I'd see myself as successful only if I could get the club back to the League."
Ross is only three years old who started his career as a coach after a period as a coach in Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the hearts management staff.
He later helped Alloa raise a category up to the third round of the purchase, as well as transform St. Mirren from a club near the fall from the category to the winner of the Championship's title next season.
And now, Ross says he feels better than he's ever felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"Perhaps it was really a turning point," he says, for taking the lead of Alloa.
"I really believed that training was the right thing for me, more than being a player.
It seems strange because I played well, made a good life because of this profession, and enjoyed some good accomplishments.
But being a player can be difficult.
You have to experience a lot of things every week.
As a result, I experience much stress and pressure from work, but training seems to be the right thing to do.
I've always wanted to train and now I've been doing something like this, and I've never been so good and self-conscious all my life as an adult."

According to one study, the perfect time to "drink a beer" is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
Summer heat waves have increased local income in difficult situations in Britain, but have increased pressure on restaurant chains.
Data show that sales in local and bar groups increased by 2.7 per cent in July — but shopping in restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a business consultant in the CGA, who collected the data, said: "The constant heat of the sun as well as England's participation in the World Cup longer than expected affected the current trend of June, where local sales increased by 2.8 per cent, while restaurants recorded a higher decline.
The shift in restaurants fell by 1.8% in June, and further worsened in July.
Bars and premises with main activities of offering drinks recorded the best performance, with higher growth than reducing trade in restaurants.
The main activities of the food supply also recognized the fall as a result of the sun’s weather, although not so considerable as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
Drink sales in bars and locals increased by 6.6 percent that month, while food dropped by three percent."
Paul Newman, an analyst of free time and hospitality at RSM said: "These results confirm the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales in the retail market, the weather and the impact of important social or sports events remain the main factors.
It is no wonder that restaurant groups continue to face difficulties, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent per annum will have a particularly heavy burden considering continuous cost pressure.
The long and hot summer could not come at a more difficult time for food operators, and the time would show if August's average temperatures would give the desired calmness."
The total sales growth in local and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the launch of brands.
The Coffer Peach index for the industry's sales tracking sector for bars and restaurants in the US collects and analyzes data from 47 companies, with a total turnover of more than 9 billion GBP, and it is the industry's reference point.
One in five children has a secret account in the social media that they hide from their parents
According to one study, one in five children — some of whom are not over 11 years of age — have a secret account in the social media that they hide to parents and teachers.
A 20 000 education students survey showed an increase in "false Insta" profiles
This news has raised the fear of sex content posts
Twenty per cent of students said they have a "creator" account showing their parents
One in five children — some of whom are not more than 11 years of age — is opening up social media accounts that are used secretly by adults.
A survey of 20,000 education students nine years ago showed a rapid increase in "false Insta" profiles - related to the Photo Distribution Page, Instagram.
This news has raised the fear of sexual harassment.
Twenty per cent of students said they use a clean "core" account that they show their parents, but they also have a private account.
A mother, who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, discovered that a teenager urged others to "violate her."
The study of the UK Digital Awareness and the Headmasters and Headmasters Conference (HMC) of independent schools revealed that 40 per cent of the 11 to 18-year-old group had two profiles, and half of them admitted that they had a secret account.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create social spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "sing of athletes" on the board of Athletics in Scotland
Elid Doyle was elected on the Atlantic board in Scotland, at the post of the executive director of this governing body, during the annual meeting of the general assembly.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and President Ian Beattie described this decision as a great opportunity for all sports leaders to benefit from its extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilid enjoys massive respect in the athletic community in Scotland, the MB and the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit extremely much by making that part of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm enthusiastic that I'm going to serve as the voice of athletes and I hope I will contribute and help in the direction of sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-metre race and 400-metre race in the 1996 Games, in Atlanta, with four total Olympic gold medals and who is a regular expert at BBC, lost his ability to walk after a temporary ischemic strike.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a hit.
I can't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell him if I was going to be cured and to what extent.
It took a tiresome job, but I was able to recover completely, I learned to walk again, and today I’m doing a lifelong exercise!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Pig pump advertising comparing mothers with cows divides public opinion
A society for the production of beer pumps has divided public opinion with a advertising that compares mothers to cows.
To begin the promotion of what is considered "the first ring pump in the world without noise and which can be worn," the company of consumer technology products Elvie showed a gastronomic music video to advertise the freedom that this new pump gives to mothers who need to express themselves freely.
Four true mothers dance in a stable full of cows under the sounds of a song with a text like this: "Yes, I'm sorry, but I don't have a tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, these are not the same, it's my chest."
Refrene continues: "Pomps, pomps, feeding babies, pomps, pomps, honey ladies."
However, advertising, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has led to online debate.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, video has received friendly reactions from viewers, with many of them expressing that it underestimates the "threat" of the milk industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product is a very weak decision.
Just like us, they must remain "sweet" and "born" to produce milk, only their "baby" takes from them a few days after they are born," someone wrote.
The Elvie Bay Pump is placed inside the recipes and not in sight (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "Almost traumatic for mother and child.
Why don't we use to advertise a ring pump for mothers who can hold their babies?"
Someone else said, "What kind of unsensitivable advertising."
Others supported the ad, including a woman admitted that the song appeared "for fun."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought one if you were still feeding the kid.
The pump made me feel just like a cow.
Advertising's a little crazy, but I saw what it means.
This is a general product," someone wrote.
Another comment: "This is a gas advertising addressed to mothers who use the pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like "lopa."
This is not a advertising that values or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women's group says they've all danced with the "visible" pump placed in the recipes.
The concept behind this campaign is based on data that many women using breast pumps say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is soundless, has no thread or tube, is placed inside the recipes and does not fall into the eye, giving women free to move, keep their babies, and even go out while they use it.
Ana Balarin, partners and ECD (Creative Executive Director) in Mother commented: "The Elvis Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved courageous and provocative promotion.
By making a parallel between women who want to express themselves freely and milk cows, we wanted to point out the use of breast pump and the challenges they face, also showing in a fun and similar way the extraordinary sense of freedom that gives the new pump.
This is not the first time Elvie pumps come out on the first page.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared on the Stylist Marta Jakubowski platform using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children have moved quietly to a tent camp on the border of Texas
The number of children detained migrants has increased even though the monthly number of crossings in the border has remained relatively the same, partly as a result of rhetoric and strict policies presented by Trump's administration that have made it difficult to send children to their supporters.
Usually, most supporters have been even undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have been afraid to risk their position in the country by trying to apply to take a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adult members of the same family would have to give fingerprints, and these data would also pass on to the emigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Emigrant and Customs Agency, testified before the Congress that the agency had arrested tens of people who had applied to support the unspecified bribery.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested had no previous criminal precedent.
"About 80 per cent of individuals who are supporters or family members of supporters remain in the country illegally and a large part of them are foreigners with criminal precedent.
So, we are continuing to follow these individuals," Mr. Albence said.
According to shelter workers, trying to process child data faster, officials introduced new rules that required some of them to appear in court within a month of the ban, not after 60 days, as was the previous standard.
Many of them will be brought before emigration judges through videoconferencing and not physically, to argue their claim for taking legal status.
Those who do not qualify will be deported immediately.
According to the shelter workers and reports received from the system in recent months, the longer children stay out of control, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent explosions or attempts to escape.
Supporters say these concerns are more serious in view of the larger environment such as Tornillo, where, due to the size, there is more likelihood that signs of a child’s difficulties will get out of hand.
They add that moving children to the tender city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good-bye to friends may cause the trauma that many of them are already facing.
Syria seeks US, French and Turkish 'victory forces' to withdraw immediately
In his speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though war in the country has already entered the eighth year.
Moulem, who also holds the Deputy Prime Minister's position, stated that foreign forces remain in Syrian land illegally, with the pretext that they fight terrorism, and that they "will act with them in the right way."
"They should withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he declared during the assembly.
Moulem insisted that "the fight against terror almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have been expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "to fight in this holy battle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories" both by terrorist groups and by "foreign foreign forces."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which mainly train and advise the Kurdish forces and the Arab Syrians who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the territory of this country divided by war.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions are good for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that push refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They are politicizing a matter that must be entirely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer aid for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral area in the last major fortress of the Idlib rebels has created an opportunity to move ahead with political discussions.
The Russian-Turkey agreement avoided a large-scale attack on Syrian forces supported by Russia, in this province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement had "clear instructions" and expressed confidence that military attacks would target the jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front related to Al-Qaeda, who "will be destroyed."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call soon for the first meeting of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moulem introduced conditions for government participation in this committee, saying the work of the panel should be limited "to revising the current constitution," and warned that there was no intervention.
Why Trump will win a second mandate
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will be re-elected in 2020 except when, as many liberally hope, accusations and scandals end his pre-eminence.
What would certainly be "the most dramatic foundation of a presidency in history!"
So far, there's no sign of eyebrows.
Since 2014, the number of viewers has doubled to 1.05m in CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6m in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average viewer of 2.4m during the peak hour, of 1.7m who was four years ago, while the MSNBC program, "The Rachel Maddow Show", has reached the top of the cable channel classification with 3.5m viewers during the evenings with major events.
"This is a fire that people are drawn to because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, director of the drama show at ABC "Designed Survival," who tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snaging Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
It brings to memory a tax trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked her why.
He answered, "Because it makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
There are entertainment values in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade if immigrant families can join and health of the global economy.
Ignoring is a luxury that can be enjoyed only by the most privileged viewers.
However, if you find yourself in six hours, looking at a panel of experts discussing the use of "pacified information" by Bob Woodward in his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's leather jacket, worth $15,000 ("a clothing filled with arrogance," The Washington Post said) as well as the implications of the living descriptions of Stormy Daniels, for Mr. Trump's anatomy, then it goes beyond being an informed citizen.
At least I'll never see Super Mario again the same way.
"A part of what he does and that makes it look like a 'reality show' is that you are fed with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive head of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the Pawn Stars, about the actors that circulate and the unexpected daily developments of Trump's program (debate with N.F.L., praise for Kim Jong).
You can't leave an episode without seeing it, or you can stay back.
When I went to Mr. Fleiss this week, the time was with the sun, and the temperature outside was 80 degrees, outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was hiding inside, seeing MSNBC, while registering CNN.
He could not leave, not while Brett Kavanaugh was going to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court, which depended on the court.
"I remember when we carried out all those crazy programs in the past and people saying, "This is the last beginning of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside the private sector falls into the tight race for Congress elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's area 17 is facing a cash flow, as a result of the reorganisation of the electoral areas that require two officials to compete for the same post.
This recent reorganisation in Pittsburgh's peripheral areas has established Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won the post in another area, in special elections last spring.
Lamb is running against another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12-year-old zone of Pennsylvania, whose new zone 17 has been replaced.
This new division of maps came after the decision of the High Court of Pennsylvania, which, in January, stated that the old areas were assigned in an unconditional and unfair manner in favour of the Republicans.
This race, in the new zone 17, has also encouraged a strong confrontation in funding campaigns by key party funding bodies, the Democratic Committee for Congress Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Committee for Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March-long special election for Pennsylvania's 18th electoral area.
For more than a decade, that post was held by the Republicans, and President Donald Trump won this area with 20 points of difference.
Political experts see Democrats as easy favors.
US takes into account to penalise El Salvador for supporting China, then withdrawing
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already met Beijing, with little push from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to remove US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama due to "the latest decisions not to know Taiwan anymore," department spokesman Heather Nauert said during a statement earlier this month.
But the fines were considered only to El Salvador who received a grant from about US$ 140m in 2017, including for control of drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties involving reductions in financial assistance and restrictions on visas would be severe for Central America and its high levels of unemployment and killings.
While internal meetings were progressing, North and Central American officials held a high-level conference focusing on security and economic well-being to follow a similar meeting last year, an action that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But in the mid-September, senior administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held, ending any opportunity to impose penalties on El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has planned to hold talks at the conference, which was predicted in mid-October, a signal that shows the importance of the administration's holding this meeting, the diplomats expressed.
And the three American envoys returned quietly from El Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic, without strong messages or punishment from Washington.
A White House official for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal discussions, provided that their anonymity was preserved.
Their explanations were confirmed by an analyst near the administration, who also spoke, seeking the right of anonymity.
Study history
The next event that is expected to take place may be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on a possible obstacle by Mr. Trump, for which there is considerable evidence in public data.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller is moving his investigation to verify whether during his campaign, Mr. Trump has co-operated with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If Congress changes its arm, Mr. Trump will have to account for this body, at a time when he is prepared to go back to the voters, and perhaps he may face an independent jury.
These are many if, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall or that of his counterparts in Europe is inevitable.
All of us, from both sides of the Atlantic, need to make choices that will affect how long the conflict will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to strike down the state against Hitler, if the West had resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the following massacre years.
The course of history depends on these turning points that speed up or delay the independent course of democracy.
Today, Americans face some of these turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the investigation against Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has not been in a difficult situation ever since this newspaper reported, during the past year, that he had suggested that he listen secretly to the president, and had speculated that he was not fit to stay in office.
Mr. Rosenstein said The Times article is not correct.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. for Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct - or if it is confirmed in the High Court despite charges based on sexual assaults and false evidence?
And above all, will we vote in future elections for a Congress that will consider Mr. Trump's responsibility?
If we fail in these tests, then democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the teaching I brought up in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia, who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who took over the residence of the ambassadors where I lived.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, sent me to burn up Chinese Sabbaths at the table holding the swastic symbol (broken cross).
Having this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Ranger player Graham Dorrans is optimistic in front of Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, Rangers await Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive equation in Spain against Villareal, earlier this month, would put them in a favourable position to qualify for the G Group of the League of Europe.
A sleep damage did not allow Mesfussor Graham Dorrans to make the first presentation of this season in the 2-2 equation to Villareal, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a push to achieve bigger things.
"It was an important point for us because Villareal is a good team," 31-year-old said.
"We went into the field believing that we could get something and came out with a point.
Maybe we could have finally noted, but, in general, I believe that equality was a good result.
Maybe they were better in the first part while we showed up in the second part and we were the best team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough fight because they got a positive result in their last match, but with the guys that support us, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was very difficult, because of the injuries suffered and changes in the club, but now there is an optimization factor in this team.
The team is good, and the boys are enjoying this very much; training is good.
I hope we can move forward, throw the past season behind our arms and succeed."
Women sleep less as a result of fear of pension savings
Even though the study participants had a clear idea of how we would like family members to show consideration for them, very few spoke to them about it.
About half the individuals in the Nationalwide study said they talked to their husbands about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent responded that they were talking to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, the vice president of society for life security, Nationwide.
Here's where we should start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you unless you first show your wishes.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how to benefit from the care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Take your financial advisor as well: The consultant can help you find a way to pay your expenses.
Options for long-term care financing include a traditional long-term care insurance police, hybrids for life-saving insurance to help cover these expenses or self-security through your wealth - as long as you have money.
Prepare legal documents: Avoid legal battles through authorization.
Take a health care procurator and appoint a trusted person who will monitor your health care and ensure that experts act in accordance with your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Also consider taking a prosecution for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and guarantee payment of bills if you cannot do such a thing yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about allergies and medications you're taking?
Prepare a written plan with these details so that you can be ready.
"Not only is the financial aspect of the game, but also who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medications will be used?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare this plan."
A person gets shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air rifle as he goes home after spending the night outside.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hands.
Police officers said this was a "random act", which occurred around 02:30 BST.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
Places taken do not pose a life - threatening threat, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials have declared as the number of dead is expected to rise.
With out-of-office communications networks, assistance workers have not been able to obtain information from the Dongalla Regency, an area north of Palu, which was closer to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palau, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after this disaster.
Below are some facts about Paul and Dongall, on the island of Sulawes:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquake and tsunami.
Dontalla is a regency that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) along the coast line in the northwest of the island of Sulawes.
Regenca, a smaller administrative region than the province, had a population of about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and fishing are the main economic activities of the province, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the other side of the Sulawesi coast.
According to the Agency for Disaster Reduction in Indonesia, Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunami over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami took over 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
In 1996, another tsunami hit the western part of Dongala, causing nine casualties.
Indonesia is located in the Sysmic Zone of the Fire Coast in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Below are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a powerful earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh in Indonesia, in the northern part of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 states, causing 226,000 casualties along the Indian Ocean coast, of which more than half lived in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds lost their lives on the island of Nias Island, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6,8 magnitude struck the south of Java, Indonesia's most popular island, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed about 700 people.

Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the great son of the former governor of Alaska and the candidate candidate for president, Sarah Palin, has been arrested with the charge of the aggression.
According to a report submitted on Saturday by the Alaskan state police, Paul, 29 years old, by Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as suspected of family violence, obstructing the reporting of violence in the family, and opposing arrest.
According to the police report, when a woman, his acquaintance, tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he picked up the phone.
Palin is being held in the Mat-Su prison building and a guarantee is being held in the form of $500 unsecured bonds, the KTUU reported.
According to reports from this network, he was brought before the court on Saturday and when asked about the admission of guilt, he declared "it is absolutely innocent".
Palin faces three violations of category A, which means he can be jailed for up to a year and be robbed of $250,000.
He is also accused of a category B violation, which is sentenced to one day in prison and $2000 fines.
It's not the first time the criminal charges against Paul have been filed.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
This matter is currently being considered by the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with family violence, a barrier to reporting violence in the family, and drinking weapons during the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he had hit him with his fists on his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups after linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD (post-traumatic stress syndrome) as a result of the service in Iraq.

Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty to suspect the terrorist attack in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York but are looking for a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been given for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30 years old, is supposed to have used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a terrorist attack on a road for motorcycles along the western highway, in lower Manhattan, crossing pedestrians and bicycles.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors need to confirm that Saipov has killed eight victims "with prejudice" and has caused serious bodily "with prejudice" injuries, according to the letter of intent to seek the death penalty, which was placed in the south of New York.
According to one court document, both of these charges may be punishable by death.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury put Saipov in front of 22 complaints, including eight counts of murder in support of organised crime, charges often used by prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
This attack has resulted in "a considerable and premeditated planning," prosecutors said, describing the way in which Saipov's crime was executed as "unfortunate, unjust and moral."
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage, damage and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," writes in the purpose letter.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York's South District criminalized a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used in a federal case in New York, it was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being sentenced to conspiracy and espionage for the benefit of the Soviet Union, two years before the Cold War.
Both of them were executed in the electric tank on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, with the Uzbek nation, showed no suspension during the days and months after the attack.
He told the investigators he felt good about what he had done, the police announced.
According to Actad, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after having no video of ISIS in his cell phone.
Police said he had also asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He said he was innocent for 22 days.
David Patton, one of the public lawyers representing Saipov, said they are "very disappointed with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty and not the acceptance of the guilt associated with eternal imprisonment without the possibility of appeal will increase the trauma caused by these events to all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek death sentences.
Conservative Party MP says NIGEL FARAGE needs to be put at the top of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today, during a protest at the Conservatives conference, that he would "mobilize the people's army".
The former UKIP leader said politicians should feel Eurosceptic pressure - after one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the EU.
In March, Deputy Conservative Peter Bone said in Birmingham that MB would 'be out' if Brexit's secretary would be Mr. Farage.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May to join her group is highlighted by the EU's conservatives, who joined another protest in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is facing difficulties in implementing the compromise plan reached in Chequers, among the attacks that come from those who want to stand or leave the European Union, as well as the EU itself.
The allies insist that she will try to reach an agreement with Brussels in spite of severe reactions - and will force Eurosceptics and labs to choose between its package and chaos.'
During the march, Fargim means Fargim, Mr. Bone said he wanted to abandon the Chequers agreement.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should take the lead and give him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he were at the top, now we would be out,' he said.
Wellingborough's deputy added: 'I will support Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers agreement.'
Expressing his stance against the EU, he said: 'We did not fight in world wars to be subdued.
We want to draw up our laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bone has rejected the suggestion that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that British have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is completely false.'
Conservative Andrea, who supports Brexit, was also in March and said to reporters: 'I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The Chequer's agreement is not supported by the general public, the opposition will not vote, it is not supported within our party and by activists who fill the streets and vote for us.
Please leave Chequers and start listening.'
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: 'The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.'
Mr. Farage said during the march that politicians should feel 'pressure' if they are thinking of abandoning the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
'Now, this is a matter of faith between us -- people -- and our political class --' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell him that we won't let you do that.'
During a message addressed to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want you to force our political class, which is near Brexit's abandonment, to feel pressure.
'We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country who gave us victory in Brexit and will not stop until the United Kingdom is independent, proud and self-government.'
Meanwhile, they set out to move to Birmingham, before holding a two - hour meeting in the center of the city.
A small group of activists held the banners where Conservatives were written against Brexit, after this group was shown on the weekend.
The supporters of Lord Adonis' labs ironically with the conservatives about the security problems they had with a "social application" during the conference's launch.
'These are the people who tell us that they can prepare the TI systems and the technology needed for "Canada plus plus", for open borders, for free trade with Ireland without borders,' he added.
'It's totally a farce.
There's no such thing as good Brexit,' he said.
Warren plans to "carefully examine" the candidacy opportunity for the president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would "carefully examine the possibility of candidate for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democratic Senator of Massachusetts spoke about her future during a meeting in the community, held on Saturday in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, an ongoing critic of President Donald Trump, is running for a re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-director of Trump's campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It has been at the centre of speculations that it can run against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon meeting in Hollywood was its 36th meeting with voters according to municipal format, since Trump came to the fore.
One of the participants asked if he had planned to run for the president.
Warren replied that the time has come for "women to go to Washington and regulate the corrupt government, and that includes the setting of a woman at the top."
A person is arrested for killing the LSU player, Wayde Sims
Police at Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that he arrested a suspect for the murder of basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
Diteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested around 11 o'clock in the morning, police department in Baton Rouge announced, through a press conference.
Police had published a shooting video on Friday, where they were looking for help to identify the person who appeared there.

Russia's Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team's instructions give victory to Sebastian Vettel
Since Walter Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the instructions of the Mercedes team" would play a significant role in this race.
Bottas left the country first and almost "penetrated" Hamilton after defending his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his team's friend.
Vettel was the first to make a stop and left Hamilton to race in "traffic" at the end of the car group, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes stopped a spin later and was positioned after Vettel, but Hamilton came out at the forefront after some maneuvers that forced Ferrari's pilot to leave space behind after a double movement to protect himself in the third round.
Max Verstappen started the race from the last row and at the end of the first row was the seventh, on his 21st birthday.
He was then in charge of a large part of the race after he did not change tires to reach a quick finish and passed Kimi Raikkonen by ranking the fourth.
He eventually stopped in the 44th round but failed to improve the pace in the eight rounds remaining by releasing the fourth place to Raikkonen.
It's a difficult day because Walter did a great job all weekend and showed me a real gentleman who let me through.
The team has done an extraordinary job with these shifts," Hamilton said.
Very Low Body Language Use
President Donald Trump ironied Senator Diane Feinstein during a Saturday's gathering, in connection with her insistence, that it was not the person who "scattered" Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate of the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh, of sexual assault.
During a speech in a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer you directly to the testimony given by Ford before the Senate's Judicial Committee, but said what was happening in the Senate shows that people are "law, evil and sinister."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that's happening in the Senate over the last few days is when you look at anger, when you see people who are angry, wicked, bad, and unrepentant," he said.
"When you look at the classified publications and then people say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, were you the one who brought the letter out?
You remember her answer... did you pull out the document-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't pull it out."
Wait a minute.
We didn't take it out... No, we didn't take it out," he said, imitating the senator.
In July, Feinstein was sent a letter with details of charges against Kavanaugh from Ford, and the document came out in September earlier — but Feinstein denied that the information had come out of her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't bring her story to the market," Feinstein told the commission, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep her secret and I kept her as she asked."
While it appears that her denial was not acceptable to the president, who commented during the debate on Saturday night: "In my opinion, the gestures really left to wish.
Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen any weaker gestures before."
Defending the candidate for the High Court, which has been accused of three women for immoral sexual conduct, the president stated that the Democrats are using alleged charges to achieve their purposes.
"They are determined to regain power on any condition.
They don't care who they hurt, who they need to break to take power and control," the media reported as saying by the president.

Air traffic controller loses his life making sure hundreds of people on an airplane rescue the earthquake
An air traffic controller, in Indonesia, is honored as a hero after losing his life by making sure that a plane that held hundreds of people falls safely.
Over 800 people have lost their lives, and many others have been declared lost after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawes on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong waves continue to disturb the area, and many have been trapped in the mines in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues running away to save him, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post on the tower of checkpoint that ran smoothly at the Palusa airport "Mutara Sis Al Jufri Airport".
He stood to ensure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, could start safely.
Then he was thrown out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was falling.
He lost his life later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirate said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he lost his life this morning before the helicopter arrived at Paul.
"This news broke our soul," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths may reach thousands themselves, while the local disaster relief agency says that entrance to the towns of Dongala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that this number will continue to grow, since there are still many bodies under the spells, while others have not been found," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
The Dals that reached about six feet [6 m] have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Friday.
Military and commercial aircraft are supplying supplies and assistance.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said about Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance brings the troops.
There's no clean water.
Mini-markets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived at Palo on Sunday and addressed the country's army: "I'm asking you to work day and night to perform any duties related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier in Lombok, where more than 550 people lost their lives.
A plane crash in Micronesia: "Air Niugini" now says a person has lost after a plane crashed in the pond
The air line leading a plane that crashed into the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now declared a missing person, having previously declared that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the floating aircraft.
In a press statement, Air Niugini said Saturday afternoon they were not finding a passenger.
The airline said it was collaborating with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators in an effort to find the person.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped to save passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water, trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in a stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the consequences of the events themselves remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the pond after not reaching the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was over the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
"This is an extremely good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that through the water that had reached the level of air, he and others managed to reach the exits of the plane’s emergency.
He said that the stewards were panicking and shouting, while he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that mariners working in the repair of a scale near there helped to save them, using an airship to transport people to the shore before the plane dives to about 30 meters (100 feet) below the water.
Data from the Aviation Security Network show that 111 people have lost their lives fighting the lines registered in PNG in the last two decades, but "Air Niugini" was not included in any of them.
An analyst builds night chronology when a woman died alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor presented her arguments in a person's retrial, which is alleged to have burned alive a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
American Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert in the field of data analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used phone data to rebuild the movements of the defendant, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night that this last one changed his life.
According to reports from The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett stated that he has received location data from some cell phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the afternoon of her death, the fact that he rejects his previous claims.
When the data revealed that his cell phone was in the same place as that of Chambers during the time he said it was with his friend Michael Sanford, then the police went to talk to this last one.
Sanford was brought before the court on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he declared that he was in Sanford's truck that night, the last one said that "he was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another disagreement is Tellis' statement, which said he had known Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Phone tables showed that they only had one week to know each other.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers died, Tellis had deleted messages, calls, and contact data from his phone.
"He hid it from his life," said Hale.
The protective ban is foreseen to provide covert arguments on Sunday.
The judge declared that the jury would take the decision that day.
The High Breed: What is a very conscious hip?
A group jumps a lot with three members demanding to challenge the negative views of this venture by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hip has gone far away from its origin of political messages and messages dealing with social issues.
They want to go back to the origin and make it known again to the conscious multitudes.
In the MB, a review of artists such as The Fugees and Commons has been observed different from artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another colored man?
Dad from New York accused the couple of getting away from work after receiving the "racist" message.
A New York father has indicted a couple for discrimination in the exclusion of work, after receiving a message sent incorrectly by a mother, who complains that she was "a different color person."
The couple have denied that they are racist, considering the indictment as "department."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, voiced her concern when she discovered that the new baby Giselle Maurice was a colorful woman, at the time she presented her first day of work, in 2016.
"JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, A LITTLE MAN," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in the message.
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, "felt ashamed," fired Mrs. Maurice, reasoning that their current baby, who was African-American, had done a weak job and that instead of her, she wanted a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her only day of work and was then sent home with a "jacket in her pocket".
Now, Maurice is indicting the couple for compensation for dismissal from work, and is seeking compensation of $350 a day for a six-month period for which she was hired, though without contract.
"I want to tell them that you shouldn't do such things," she said to The Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejected claims that they were racist, saying Maurice's removal was the right act, because they were afraid they could not believe it after they had offended him.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said the husband of Joel Plasco for The Post.
"But would you leave the children in the hands of a person to whom you have been rude, even though wrong?
Your newborn child?
Tell me."
Considering the indictment as "department," Plasco said that he and his wife had brought a child to life two months ago and were in a "very difficult situation."
"Can you avenge anyone in this situation?
It's not something positive to do," said Plasco, investment banker.
While the case has gone to court, the public opinion has quickly denounced the couple in social media, criticizing them for their behaviour and logic.
A new letter shows that Paddington’s publishers were afraid that readers would not associate with a spoken gold
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book's accession, said about this letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of a person who reads it for the first time before it was published.
We feel great pleasure now that we have seen the extraordinary success of Paddington."
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before being inspired by a little pregnant bear to write the book for children, would be upset if his work would be refused, adding that 60 years of publication of the book, last year after his death, contained "trouble and happiness".
As for Paddington, which she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of success.
"He was a quiet person and not great," she said.
"Paddington was so real that it was like having a successful child: you feel proud of him even though it's not exactly your success.
I think that's how he looked at Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave his own merits to Paddington's character."
My daughter was changing her life, and I was forced to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon arrival, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nyya, where doctors had tried to save her life but had no results.
"No one called me regularly to tell me that it was very heavy, that he didn't think he would go out," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"After me I received a call from Nad that said she would die in two minutes and that I should say goodbye.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Now, I love you so much.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that doctors had given her to keep her heart at work were losing her effect and slowly leaving her system.
She had died a few years ago, and now everything's "getting done."
I was forced to sit down and wait, knowing that this was happening.
I could not cry or scream because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to be strong."
With the passing of time, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, waving for the loss of her daughter, jumped on a plane with other passengers - who were not aware of what she was experiencing.
"No one knew," she said.
"I kept my head down and all the time I was crying.
It is hard to explain, but during that flight, I felt a great regret for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women who shed tears post letters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent letters of inspiration to a bridge in Wells as well as phone numbers of people who can call for support.
Ms. Davis' son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want no parent to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old, resident in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a "legging" smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
People always said that his smile lights up every room."
However, he gave up his job before he changed his life after it was "at a really dark moment."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the person who found his brother after committing suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly worried that there will be a domino effect."
Mrs. Davis created the letters, "that people should know that there are people who can help them and with whom they can talk, even with a friend.
Don't sit alone - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been Mrs. Davies' friend for many years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, not long after his mother's death.
"He did not say he felt upset, depressed or anything else," she said.
"Some days before Christmas, they noticed the change in behavior.
He was extremely upset on Christmas day--when the children opened their gifts, he didn't see them in his eyes and did no action."
She said that his death was a great trauma to them, but that they had to overcome, "It's something that destroys the whole family.
We destroyed us.
But we all have to move forward and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on the first line after the FBI's investigation began
"I thought that if we could give something similar to what he was looking for -- a limited investigation in time and in object -- maybe we could bring some harmony," Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee was "losing" among the many obstacles of the opponents.
Why didn't you want Mr. Kavanaugh and his republican supporters to investigate the FBI?
Their ridicule comes as a result of time.
Congress elections are only five weeks away, on November 6th -- if Republicans go wrong, as is expected, they will be very weak in their efforts to select the person they want in the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has called the senators, begging them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and through him I met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI issues her report?
It will be voted in the Senate, where 51 republics and 49 Democrats are currently present.
It is not yet clear if Mr. Kavanaugh could gather at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to put an end to this situation and confirm it in the High Court.
Number of deserters in North Korea under Kim's leadership
The number of deserters in North Korea has fallen since Kim Jong came into power seven years ago, has declared a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Union Ministry in South Korea, has stated that there were about 1127 deserts last year - compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the main factors were the strictest controls between North Korea and China and the highest rates requested by human beings' traffickers.
Penieni has not made public comments.
Most deserters from North Korea are subjugated by South Korea.
Seoul has declared that more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them go to China, which has the largest length of the North Korean border, and there can be more easily crossed compared to the Emilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is protected by numerous forces.
China considers illegal migrant deserters, not as refugees and often rehabilitates them with force.
Relations between North Korea and South - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Penian and their talks focused on late negotiations for denuclearisation.
This meeting came after the historic meeting of June, between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong, in Singapore, where they agreed, in general terms, to work for a Korean army without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions on the lack of progress so far.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no faith in our national security and in these circumstances, there is no chance that we will disarm the first," Mr. New said during a talk at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histrick," and says he's not worthy of serving at the High Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called High Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh "histrick" and said that because of his temper, he was unable to serve in the High Court.
Pelos made these comments on Saturday during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't believe that if a woman had ever brought such a thing, people would say 'historic'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh categorically denied the charges that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his presentation, Kavanaugh was very concerned and at some moments almost chirping or "getting his mouth" when he spoke about his family and the high school years.
He accused the Democrats explicitly before the committee, calling charges against him "a grotesque and coordinated attack on his image", organised by liberals angry with Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelos expressed her opinion that Kavanaugh's testimony was proof that he could not serve in the High Court, since she showed his prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he penalized himself with those statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelos hesitated to answer the question whether he would try to give Kavanaugh a motion of disbelief in the event of his appointment, and if the Democrats win most of the countries in the House of Representatives.
"Let me tell you -- if he's not showing the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he's unqualified not only for the High Court, but also for the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a court judge at the Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelos added that, as a democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decisions against the Anti-Legment Act or the Roe anti-Wade case, since it is considered a conservative court.
At the sessions for his appointment, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would power certain decisions of the High Court.
"It is not the time for a hysterical and unilateral person to become a member of the court and wait for us to say "oh well!" said Pelosio.
And women should use it.
This is a right verbal attack, months and years of rage that explodes, and it can't lead to the end without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual.
She continued, "A woman who worked in a leading position helped me a lot, who said that she also wept when she was angry, but had worn out a style that whenever she was angry and started to cry, she would tell the co-dealers, "You can think I'm upset and therefore I'm crying.
But I'm actually angry."
And then she kept talking.
And I thought that was a brilliant idea."
Lots are a way to express anger, partly because they are totally misunderstood.
One of my more vivid memories of an old job, in an office where men prevailed and at one point I found myself crying out of inconceivable anger, was the moment when a larger woman caught me by the face — a cold manager I have always had — pushed me toward the stairs.
"Never let others see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're upset and they'll be glad they made you upset."
Patricia Schroeder, also a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential nominations.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found in the middle of an extramarriage on board a boat called "Monkey Business" and got out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very angry, realized there was no reason why he didn't think of running for the president himself.
"This wasn't a well-weighted decision," she said to me laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was a more candidate.
Someone called it "Borebardha and Seven Jewess."
Since the campaign was in its final stages, it had stayed after the fund meeting, I swore it wouldn't be too late if it couldn't get $2 million.
But it was a stupid war.
She found that some of her supporters who were giving $1,000 to men, she was only giving $250.
"Don't you think they're making me any lower?" she asked herself.
During the speech he announced that he would not develop an official campaign, it was so full of emotion — gratitude for the people who supported it, angered the system that made it so difficult to collect money and mark voters instead of delegates, and angered with sexism — that they were killed.
"It looked as if I had suffered a nervous crisis," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacted to it.
"It looked like Kleinex was my sponsorship corporation.
Remember that I thought what people would write on my gravestone?
"She's crying?"
US-China Trade War Advantages for Beijing
The first trade wars between the US and China were deafening, and as the war is far from over, a split between the two countries could be an advantage for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning early this year, imposing taxes on the main Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most sensitive step was the one that took place this week, when new tariffs affected goods worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), effectively taxing half of the goods entering the United States from China.
Beijing has been avenged "in kind" every time, finally setting tariffs from five to ten per cent above US$ 60 billion.
China has pledged to return the US with the same currency, and the second largest economic power in the world is unlikely to be surrendered soon.
The removal of measures from Washington means surrendering to their demands, but for China's President Xi Jinping, it would be very embarrassing to submit publicly to the US.
However, experts said that if China correctly plays its cards, the pressures coming from the US trade war with the US could positively support China in the long term, to reduce the interdependence of these two economies.
"The fact that political decisions, quickly taken both in Washington and Beijing, can cause economic decline in each of these countries, is much more dangerous than what has been seen from the outside," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher at the research centre for new American security, which focuses on the Asian continent.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is much more stable and secure because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate destroyed areas by terrorists, to restore normality.
Now, there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to their country, from which you have to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their well-being.
The UN estimates that some 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
About six million others who still live in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moulem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed state.
But he stressed that the country would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries sponsoring the resurrection.
Europe wins the "Ryder Cup" trophy in Paris
The European team has won Ryder Cup 2018 after defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5, in Le Golf National, off Paris, France.
The US has already lost 6 radical matches in European territory and has won this trophy in Europe since 1993.
Europe reminisced after the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team managed to get 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who was the player who faced more difficulties during the tournament, took the first hit in the water and closed the 16th with 3 more shots than the assigned level, losing the match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player, Molinari, shined on all his rounds, becoming 1 of the 4 players that achieved the result 5-0-0, since the current format began to be applied in 1979.
US Jordan Spieth won 5&4 by the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The number one player in the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played at his last end of Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has played at eight Ryder Cup, became the most successful European player of all times in this tournament, with 25.5 points in career.
"Normally, I don't cry but today I can't keep myself.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so, so happy we took the cup.
Success is the team, and I'm happy to have the opportunity to help them," Garcia said quite excitedly after the victory of the European team.
He passed the word to his fellow nation, John Ram, who defeated the 2+1 American golf legend Tiger Woods, in direct challenges on Sunday.
"I feel an extraordinary pride that beat Tiger Woods. I am raised to see that player," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all his matches in France, and now there are statistics 13-21-3, during his career in Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics from one of the greatest players of all time, which has won 14 important titles, ranked second after Jack Nicklaus.
The US team has had a hard time taking the ball to the right place all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after the disappointing appearance of his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought hard.
There were moments during this paradise when we put pressure on the European team.
We fought hard.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players played pretty well.
We'll regroup, work with PGA in America and with our Ryder Cup committee and move forward.
I love these 12 boys, and I'm proud to be the captain.
We've got to get the hat off.
They played better than us."
