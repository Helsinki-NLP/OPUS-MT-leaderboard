Major members of the congregation are concerned about the similarity with Mapetovci
Some members of the congregation are shocked by the proposal to change their title in "the members of the Great Parliament" (MWP).
This was due to plans to change the congregation's name to the Belgian Parliament.
Members of the congregation throughout the entire political spectrum are concerned that this could be the subject of ridicule.
A labyrinth member of the congregation said his group was concerned "because it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers of van Vels: In the big twp means foolish, and pwp means rash.
A member of the Plyd political party assembly said the group as a whole "not satisfied" and proposed alternative names.
A member of the large conservative party said his group was "open" about renaming, but noted that there was a small difference between MWP and Mapetovac.
In this context, the statement of the great word in the word in the word in the Yorkshire English is similar.
The Community Commission, currently working on the draft law on the introduction of changes in names, said: "The final decision on the descriptions of the members of the assembly will, of course, bring the members themselves."
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the congregation authority to change names.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public debate on proposals that resulted in great support for the appointment of the assembly to the Grand Parliament.
When it comes to the title of members of the assembly, the Commission has given priority to calling members of the Grand Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option has received the most support in the public debate.
Members of the congregation are allegedly making alternative proposals, but efforts to reach consensus could be put at the forefront of President Elina Jones, from which it is expected to submit a draft law on changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will also include other changes to the way in which the assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of members of the assembly and the Commission's system plan.
Members of the congregation will have the last opportunity to vote on their name when discussing the law.
Macedonians go to the referendum on changing the name of the country
The voters will vote Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to "The Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The national vote was organised in an effort to resolve a multi-decenary dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbour is the occupation of its territory and is persistently opposed to its requirements for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, the opposition of the plebiscite to change the name, said he would not admit the vote.
However, the referees, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, consider the change of name to be a simple price they must pay for membership of the EU and NATO Pact.
The bells on St. Martin were silenced while the churches in Harlem fought for survival
"The older people I spoke to say that once on every corner there were bars and churches," said Mr. Adams.
"There's no one today."
He said the disappearance of the bar is understandable.
"People are different today," he said.
"Bars are no longer quarter-day residents in which people go regularly."
As for churches, he is concerned that money from the sale of property will not last as long as the managers expect, "and sooner or later, they will return to where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by residential buildings with apartments full of people who will not help to preserve the rest of the quarters.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and that is why they will speed up closing these churches because it is unlikely that people who move into these buildings will become members of these churches."
Both churches built white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and the Church of St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
The black community that served in the vicinity took over the building.
The church of St. Martin took over a black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the trade boycott on 125th Street, the main trade street in Harlem, who opposed the formation or promotion of blacks.
The fire in 1939 damaged the building, but how Father Johnson’s parishioners made a plan to rebuild, they ordered orgulas.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson, and his successor in the Church of St. Martin, proudly called the "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the organ in July called them different: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first organs in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to larger organs in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said the Church of St. Martin did not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in the Church of St. Martin's last few months is a complicated story about architects and entrepreneurs, some of which were brought by church leaders and other bishops.
The Bishop's Administration – the administrative body of the bishops, composed of church leaders – wrote to the bishop in July expressing concern that the bishop would "continue to bear the costs" to the Bishop's Administration, although the Bishop's Administration was not included in the rental of architects and entrepreneurs that the bishop had sent.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the bishop's work.
The shark injured a 13-year-old during the hunting in the lobsters in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while hunting lobsters in California on the day of opening hunting, officials reported.
The attack happened about seven hours ago by the beach Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said about the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he ran around half an hour on Saturday with his friends when he heard the boy calling for help and then drove the group to him and helped him get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was an excitement to catch the lobster, but then "he realized he was shouting, 'She bit me!'
She bit me!'
His entire key bone was torn apart," Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I called out to everyone out of the water, 'The shark is in the water!' He added.
The boy is transferred by helicopter to the Soviet Paediatric Hospital where his condition is being treated as critical.
It's not known what kind of shark attacked him.
The rescuer Captain Larry Giles said in a media address that the shark was already noticed in that area a few weeks earlier, but that it was found not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the body.
Officials closed the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the beauty market in Britain
Sainsbury's is becoming a competition for Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams chains to department cosmetic products in the style of craft houses where professional assistants work.
As part of a significant market transition to beauty in Britain worth 2.8 billion pounds, which is growing while selling on fashion markets and household equipment falls, larger cosmetics units will be tested at 11 stores across the country, and will be extended to more shops next year if they succeed.
Investment in cosmetic products is due to the fact that supermarkets find ways to use the policies that have been used for television, microwaves and household equipment.
Sainsbury's said it would double its cosmetic assortment by offering more than 3,000 products, including brand products such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing brand product palette L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space in departments like those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket will also relaunch its Boutique makeup line by making most of the products suitable for vegans – something that is more and more looking for younger buyers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop perfume shop will test sales places in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which was opened in Croydon, South London last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Net purchases and shifts to daily purchases of smaller quantities of food in local stores mean that supermarkets need to put extra effort into attracting people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of the Sainsbury's chain, said stores would increasingly look like a factory house in the supermarket's efforts to reverse the impact of the large Aldi and Lidl discounts, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opened the Argos sales department in hundreds of its stores, and also imported and Habitat departments since they bought both chains two years ago, which says it increased the sales of food products and the profitability of the purchase.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernise its cosmetic and pharmaceutical products has ended unprovoked.
Sainsbury's tested the joint approach with the Boots chain in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended with a dispute about the share of the revenues of the pharmacy in their stores.
The new strategy came into effect three years ago after Sainsbury's sold his 281 pharmacy to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy for 125 million pounds.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in this plan by adding an additional line of luxury products for skin care in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of the Sainsbury's chain, said: "We have transformed the appearance and experience of our departments of beauty to give our customers a more pleasant environment.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be at hand to offer advice.
Our assortment brand is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and practical locations mean that we are now an irrefutable destination of the market of beauty that sets new standards in relation to the old way of buying."
Peter Jones was "crazy" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from an agreement worth 11 million pounds.
The Dragons Day star, Peter Jones, is "slow" after the TV leader Holly Willoughby withdrew from the deal with his personal brand worth 11 million pounds to focus on his contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand home and additional equipment Truly.
The company of this money is compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
This Morning (37) was announced by the show's director on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered the Dragons' Day of Peter Jones show star by withdrawing from their profitable brand in the last moment – to focus on their new entry contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources said Jones was "crazy" when a golden girl admitted to television, during a tense meeting Tuesday in his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, meant that there was no longer time to devote to their branding of household and additional equipment Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow Goop and was expected to double the Willoughby's fortune estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby (37) announced her departure on Instagram, Jones flew from Britain to one of his weekends.
The source said, "Holly Truly put himself in top of his priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term plan to secure her earnings over the next few decades.
Her decision to pull herself out of the way is all involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to launching.
In Marlow's seat, there's a lot of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that this Morning, which is one of the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions due to huge investment in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothing and household equipment, and possible additional postponement of the launch date.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cappov in 2016 and Jones (52) joined the company in March.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones has 40 percent share in Baldwin's production house.
Willoughby will become an M&S brand ambassador and will replace Anta McPartlin as a leader in ITV show I'm A Celebrity.
The source of closeness to Jones said last night, "We wouldn't comment on his business."
Heavy words, 'and then we fell in love'
He complained about the criticism he might get from the media because of comments that could be characterized as "unprecedented" and because of a positive stance on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with his crazy voice "reader of the news."
"I didn't give up at all."
It turned out that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump declared their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step forward to the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the senior North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders and the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see the "adequate response" by the US at the first steps of North Korea to disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump gave a much more positive opinion during his speech at the assembly.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were on a step from the North Korean war.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to repair the relationship with Kim had brought positive results - the release of rocket tests, the release of hostages and the return of the afterlife of American soldiers.
And he stood in defense of his unusual approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's easy to act presidentially, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this full arena, we'd have about 200 people here," Trump said, showing the world in front of him.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed the island by killing hundreds
After the earthquake on Lombok Island, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of the island of Lombok has been displaced, the state of the national disaster has not been declared, which is a prerequisite for receiving international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it will be quite difficult," Mrs Sumbun said.
While the Save the Children organization is a team that will travel to Pala, they are still not sure if foreign personnel can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson of the National Disasters Agency, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation on the island of Pala to see if international agencies should be allowed to participate in the provision of assistance.
In view of the constant earthquake in Indonesia, it is regrettable how much this country is not prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although the tsunami shelters are built in Aceh, they are not often seen on other parts of the coast.
Apparently, there was no siren behind the tsunamis on the island of Pala, although the warning was in force, so it contributed to the loss of life.
And in ideal conditions, travel between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship anchored in Lombok to help victims of earthquakes is on their way to Paul, but it will take him at least three days to get to the scene of a new accident.
President Yoko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's long-term infrastructure and did not save money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has hit Mr. Yoko's administration while awaiting new elections next year.
Mr. Yoko was also under pressure from long-standing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people have lost their lives, and tens of thousands have been displaced because of the street struggles of Christian and Muslim groups, who used swords, bows and arrows, and the remaining primitive weapons.
See: Footballer Liverpool Daniel Sturridge has entered a deep-separate strike against Chelsea Football Club
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing the Premier League at the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a ball from Xherdan Shakiri on some 30 yards from Chelsea's naked club while his team lost 1:0.
He transferred the ball to his left side and then shut up to the outside stop.
The ball flew high above the penalty area turning to the top right corner of the network.
Eventually, she fell over Kep Arrizabalg, who was in the jump and fell into the net.
"It was only until positioning, until receiving the ball, and players like Shaq always go forward as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time," Sturrudge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I touched her once and I didn't think much, I just hit the ball."
Chelsea led 1-0 on a half-time after the Belgian star Eden Hazard hit in 25 minutes.
In that fifth attack, the Blue Attacker added Mate Kovacic's ball before running from the middle of the field to Liverpool's half.
The covac quickly touched the ball and returned the ball to the center of the field.
Then he made a beautiful cross, pointing Hazard into a prison space.
Hazard was faster than a defense and ended up near the stable by putting his left leg in the net outside Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool is fighting Napoli in the team phase of League Champions in three hours Wednesday at Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's game against Videoton in the League of Europe in three hours on Thursday in London.
The number of Indonesian tsunami victims reached 832
The number of victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the state disaster agency said early Sunday.
A large number of people were reported in the ruins of a building that destroyed an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude that occurred on Friday and raised waves high and up to 20 feet, the agency spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with the remains of broken buildings.
Police arrested a man (32) after a woman was stabbed dead
A murder investigation was conducted after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, in the Merseyside area.
Forty-four-year-old was found stabbed at 7:55 in the morning at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 30-year-old man was arrested suspected of murder.
The police called on people who were nearby to see or hear anything to answer.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is at an early stage, but I'm calling all who were near John Street Street in Birkenhead and who saw or heard anything suspicious about contacting us.
I would also like to invite everyone, especially the cab drivers, who may have recorded some cameras on the car control panels, to contact us because they may have information that is important for the investigation."
The police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found from Birkenhead and was found in the house.
This afternoon's friends who think they know a woman came to the face instead to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police have said they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
The cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police informed him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He ran out of text when he found out what happened.
The residents were now told that they would have to wait hours before they were allowed to go back in.
They heard a cop tell a man that the whole area is considered a crime scene.
One woman came to a crime scene in tears.
She said, "This is so horrible."
At 2:00 a.m., two police vans were inside the police cordon, and another van was next door.
A larger number of police officers were inside the police cordon, overseeing the apartment building.
All who have any information are invited to contact @MerPolCC directly, call 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers line at 0800 555 111, stating the case 247 of 30 September.
Statua Cromwell in parliament became the newest monument in the middle of a "revision of history" dispute.
Its removal would represent a poetic justice for the destruction of numerous cultural and religious artifacts in England that have been carried out by its Puritan followers in the Taliban way.
But Cromwell Society's proposal, Mr. Crick, described as "crazy" and "probate review of history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "As part of the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that even Oliver Cromwell's character in front of the Palace in Westminster became a target.
Cromwell didn't order, he didn't do an iconorship during the English civil war.
The wrong Cromwell could be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestors Thomas from the previous century.
The magnificent display of Cromwell's author, Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of an opinion from the nineteenth century and a part of the character's history that many still believe should be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell many consider, perhaps by the end of the 19th century more than today, to be the protector of parliament from outside pressure, in his case of monarchy.
Whether this is entirely the subject of a permanent historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict from the middle of the seventeenth century formed further development of our nation and that Cromwell is a recognized character representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord of Protection are also worthy of glory and remembrance."
The killer's pig killed the Chinese farmer.
The pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
A man, known only as Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered with blood in a pig in a market in the city of Liupanshui in Guizhou area, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig was prepared to inject the pigs into the pigs of the vaccine in May 30th 2005, in Xining, Qinghai, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pig's mouth with blood.
The forensic investigation confirmed that the pig weighed 550 pounds and caused fatal injuries to the farmer, as stated in the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and broken," said a cousin who introduced himself as Wu, broadcasts Guiyang Evening News.
The security footage shows Yuan who came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 in the morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent the attack on other people while the police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market owners are allegedly negotiating a rebate for his death.
Although rare, cases of swine attacks on humans have been reported earlier.
Pig attacked a woman and her husband in 2016 at their farm in Massachusetts, killing a man's critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig had a heavy 650 libre, and she loved a big farmer with his tractor until his wife was scared and driven away.
After the pigs were eaten by the Oregon farmer in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said to CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "a trigger".
"They're just playing.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they have no intention of hurting you.
You just have to respect them enough," he said.
The rest of Rosa's hurricane brings widespread rains to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakened by moving above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rains across northern Mexico and south-west of the United States in the next few days.
Rosi's first category hurricane winds reached 85 miles an hour from five o'clock in the morning to the east time on Sunday, and was 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, I form in the Pacific and move to the east and west coast of the United States. As the tropical storm of Rosa approaches the Bay California Peninsula on Monday, it will start pushing the tropical investment north to the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture together with the emerging ice will create widespread rains in the southwest in the following days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will result in floods, nasus and possible cliffs in the desert.
High tropical moisture will result in falls that will instantly reach and 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in the parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Even 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Floods are possible as a result of sudden deterioration of weather conditions and typical precipitation of tropical rain.
Flying pedestrians in the desert would be extremely thoughtless at the risk of tropical rains.
Large rains in the canyons could result in wild rivers, and thunderstorms, mostly strong winds and sand storms.
As I arrive, I will bring the local rains on the parts of the coast of southern California.
It is possible to cause total rainfall over half the inches, which could cause the nanos and the slide of August.
This will be the first wet season rain in the region.
The room will reach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday before the rain becomes more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
The lungs will reach Four Corners on Tuesday and continue on all Wednesdays.
In October, large fluctuations of temperatures across the United States can occur as the Arctic is getting colder, and the tropicals remain rather warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at short growths.
There is an excellent example of the dramatic difference in temperature in the Central United States on Sunday.
The difference in temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri and Omahi, Nebraska and between St Louis and Des Moins, Iowa, was almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days, summer heat remains will try again to buy and expand.
The beginning of October will be warm in most of the central and eastern parts of the United States with temperatures from about 80 degrees from the southern plains to the northeastern parts.
The temperature in New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term weather forecast announces a great possibility of temperature above average in the Eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people saw the exciting testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the High Court of Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assault alleged to have occurred in the 1980s on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political resistance continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular broadcasts due to the latest set-up on Friday: an agreement made by Senator Arizona Jeff Blake with the FBI on a one-week indictment investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Commission that it was 100% sure to accept Kavanaugh's touch and try to relax at a high school party.
In a passionate confession, Kavanaugh said that a hundred percent was sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, this was probably seen by more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company accounted for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for the other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen's usually having trouble getting people to watch the transfer from the office.
In order to get a better touch, it's a public like the one that follows football elimination matches or Oscar's assignment.
Fox News Channel, whose editors supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led in front of other networks with an average number of 5.69 million viewers during the day-to-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest is high and after the hearing.
Flake was the central character of the drama on Friday.
After the office of a moderate Republican issued a statement that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugha, the CNN and CBS network cameras recorded footage of protestors who shouted at him after he tried to enter the elevator to attend the hearing of the judicial commission.
He's been standing up looking at him for a few minutes while he was being insulted, with a live transmission to the CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the earth?
It was said to him, 'You have power when so many women are in a position to do so.'
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that there was more to say at the hearing of the commission.
Cable and television networks had a live transmission hours later while the Judicial Commission voted whether to follow the appointment of Kavanaugha to the Senate to vote.
But Flake said he would do it only on condition that the FBI investigates charges against the so-called next week, which calls for a minority of Democrats.
Flakea's part convinced talks with a friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few senators after that, Flake decided.
Flake's choice was significant because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "playing politics" about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union to "play politics" with Britain's future and undermine national interests in the Sunday Times interview.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a conservative party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In a second interview up to her headline, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit, saying it was a proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU take customs from each other "very absurd".
The murder of Waydea Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, the suspect for the death of the LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in a deadly shooting that killed Waydea Sims, a 20-year-old basketball club LSU.
Dyteon Simpson (20) was arrested and imprisoned under a second-degree murder charge, said Baton Rouge's police department.
Officials have published video records of disputes between Sims and Simpson and police said Simpson lost his glasses during the fight.
Police took the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reporting the WAFB channel of the CBS network.
After the Simpson investigation, police said he confessed to killing Wayde.
His bailout's $350,000, a lawyer said.
Baton Rouge's death warrant issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot shot in the head and neck.
The department said the merits belong to the police working group for the Louisiana fugitives, the criminal police lab, the Southern University police and the local authorities who have helped during the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director of LSU Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement agency for the "difficulty and thirst for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot attacker and the 6-inch attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a basketball player at the LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per match.
On Friday morning, LSU Will Wade's basketball coach said the team was "depressed" and "in shock" because of Wade's death.
"This is what we keep worrying about," Wade said.
Volcano throws ash through Mexico City
The ashes that bloomed the Volcano Popocatepetl have reached the southern quarters of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Protection Centre warned Mexicans on Sunday to stay at a safe distance after the volcanic activity in the crater increased and after 183 emissions of gas and ashes were registered at 24 hours.
The center was monitoring more earthquakes and poisoning.
Pictures on social media show a thin layer of ashes covering windshield cars in Mexico City’s neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have observed an increased activity of volcanoes located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since the earthquake of 7.1 hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists at the annual independence referendum
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Sunday after protestors, supporters of independence, clashed with a special police squad, when thousands of people joined counter-demonstrations on the marking of the anniversary of a polarizing Catalan withdrawal referendum.
A group of masked separatists, detained by a special police squad, shot them with their eggs and colors in the dust, making dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later in the course of the day, they broke out and raided the police who used hangings to slow down the fight.
Independence supporters have been scandalizing for hours "No forgets, No Forgiveness" and clashing with Union supporters who called "Live Spain".
Fourteen people received medical treatment for minor injuries they suffered in protests, local press reported.
Tensions are still high in a region that has been defined as independence a year after the first October referendum that Madrid declared illegal, but which Catalan separatists are famous.
The voters chose independence by a vast majority, although the output was low because the anti-depressants boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting in violent conflicts throughout the region.
Groups defending independence camped Friday night to prevent demonstrations and support the national police.
The demonstrations were still held, but they changed the route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalan independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of happiness because they're allowed to vote, but we're in a locker now," he said.
Although they took the key, but a fair victory in the local elections last December, the Catalan parties that are relying on independence had difficulty keeping the hold because some of their most famous leaders are in a self-appointed exile or in detention, awaiting trial for their role in organizing a referendum and then declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old auto mechanic who recorded a protest on the phone to support the police, said politicians on both sides supported the conflict.
"It's getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who was in custody since the end of last year, announced his candidacy in elections for the European Parliament next year.
"The candidacy in European elections is the best way to condemn the backward democratic values and repression imposed by the Spanish authorities," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after being hit by a car in the house
Three men (33, 34 and 39) were arrested several times by car in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate was damaged as well as the building itself.
There's a possibility that at one point the car was shot from a single shot.
Menge's hit on Livingstone's victory from 1:0 against Rangers.
First goal Dolly Menge secured a victory for Livingston
The advanced Livingston surprised Rangers and noted only another loss for Steven Gerrard at the 18-game Ibrox Club.
The goal of Dolly Menge was key, while Gary Holt's club was leveled with Hibernia elsewhere.
Gerrard's club has not recorded any victory in the guests in the Premier League this season and will play against the first-placed Hearts behind which eight points will be left next week.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapids from Vienna to the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone has extended a series of matches in the league to six matches, and Chief Coach Holt hasn't yet experienced defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed the opportunity against a missing guest.
Holt's team was supposed to be in charge a lot before they scored because their direct game was very problematic for Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried, but his attempt went past the goal, then Alan Lithgrow's attempt went past the goal after he slipped to get the ball Craig Halkett's head turned to the goal.
Hosts were asked to allow Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems for guests from free hits.
And that's how the key goal was achieved.
He was sentenced to a free strike against Rangers, Livingston made a passage, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created an opportunity for Manga, who took the ball and hit it from the center of the prison.
Until then, Rangers dominated the ball's possession, but the sheltered host remained impenetrable and the goalman Liam Kelly didn't have much trouble.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Kelly had to intervene for Alfred Morelos.
Scott Pittman's feet were stopped by Golman Rangers Allan McGregor, and Lithgow was hiding too wide from another free shot for Livingston.
Crosses have constantly arrived in the prison area of Livingstone and have been constantly defended, while two penalties that have been sought – one after the failure against the replacement player Glenn Middleton and the other because of the game – have not been awarded.
"Fenmenal Game" Livingstone – Analysis
Journalist BBC Scotland, Alasdair Lamont is in Tony Macaroni Arena
The phenomenal game and the result of Livingstone.
Everyone up to one was great and they continue to surpass expectations on the way up.
Their style of games and players have almost not changed since their return to the top, but the big credit belongs to Holta who gives her energy to the team from her arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant, leading a well-organized defense, until Menga gave peace to Connor Goldson and Joe Worral.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
From time to time, they were good under Gerrard's battalion, and they didn't reach that level.
The final hits were missing – only once through the host lines – and this is the kind of call for awakening for Rangers located in the middle of the table.
Mixed reception for Erdogan in Cologne
Saturday (September 29th) was a sign of smile and blue sky while Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany, whose goal is to repair the NATO relationship with the Allies.
They differed on issues such as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
This is the city where the largest number of Turks out of Turkey lives.
Police have imposed security measures as a reason to block the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters have gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters who oppose Erdogan – many of them Kurdi – were also loud, condemning Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Double protests reflect the split in opinions about a guest some German Turks celebrate as a hero, while others blame him for being an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: The biker died in a car crash
The biker died in a car crash in London.
There was a crash near the intersection of the Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, on the transport road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, about 10:15 after British weather.
The car driver stopped and intervened an ambulance team, but the man died on the spot.
The crash took place a few months after the second biker died in a part in which the driver left the crash site, in the street of Childers Street, which is about a mile away from the crash site.
The London police said they were working on the victim's identification and family information.
The streets are closed, the buses are redirected, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six employees injured in riots
Six prison officials were injured in high-security prison accidents for men, said from the Prison Office.
The riots ended in Long Lartin's prison, Worcestershire's area, Sunday at 9:30 a.m. in British time, and they're still going on.
A special team of "Tornado" officials was called to calm down the nests in which eight guards were involved in one wing of the prison.
Officials have suffered minor facial injuries and help is provided on the spot
The prison administration's Portparol said: "We have arranged specially trained prison personnel dealing with an incident that is ongoing in Long Lartin's prison.
Six staff members received medical assistance due to the injury.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have made it clear that the police will be responsible for it and that they could be extended prison sentences."
Long Lartin's prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison manager was admitted to hospital treatment after being attacked by the prisoner.
And in October last year, a special team was called to prison for serious disturbances in which personnel were attacked by billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Late City (which can be useful in areas affected by drought)
Rarely when tropical depression hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen at the beginning of next week while Hurricane Rosa passes through the desert south-west region with its remaining energy, bearing the risk of flooding.
National Meteorological Administration has already issued warnings on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona and South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including cities Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass through Phoenix directly on Tuesday, and her approach will announce the rain on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Administration in Phoenix stated that only "ten tropical cyclones since 1950 had kept the status of tropical storms or depression in a 200-mile circle around Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that was 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest projections of the National Hurricane Centre predict 2-4 inches of rainfall, and in isolated parts of Mogollon Rome in Arizona and up to 6 inches.
In other parts of the southwest, including the central part of the Rockies chain and Great Basin, there will probably be 1 to 2 inches, and possibly up to 4 inches in isolated parts.
In parts where there is no fear of the flood, Rosina rain could be a blessing because the area was hit by the drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these rainfalls are likely to be of benefit because the southwest is currently hit by drought.
According to the U.S. drought control agency, a little more than 40 percent of Arizona was hit by extreme drought, another highest category," weather.com said.
First, on its way, Hurricane Rosa will lead to a cliff on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, who will still have the power of hurricanes on Sunday mornings with 85 miles per hour winds, will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will reach the colder waters of the Pacific and that's why it's going to start eating.
Therefore, Mexico is expected to hit the tropical storm by force on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rains in parts of Mexico could be very strong and could pose a great risk of flooding.
"The total rainfall from three to six inches is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonor, and maybe even 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Then Rosa will move north through Mexico by tropical storm before coming to Arizona early in the morning in the form of tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and south Utah late in the evening.
"The main danger expected of Rose or its remains is major rains in Baja California, North-West Sonori and the American South-West Desert," said the National Hurricane Centre.
These rains are expected to cause stormy floods of life and flooding in the deserts, as well as cliffs in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a sixteen-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
Teenagers found injured near the Excelsior Terrace street in Midsomer Norton on Saturday about 4 hours in the morning after British weather.
He's taken to the hospital and he's in a stable condition.
Seventeen-year-old, two-eight-year-olds and twenty-year-olds were arrested in the Radstock area, said Avon and Somerset policemen.
Officials are calling for those who have any video of the events on the mobile phone.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the subjugation and anger" of the democratic party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugha is a vote against the brutal and unwarranted tactics of a democratic party," Trump said at a gathering in Welling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the subjugation and anger" of the democratic party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's claim that he had been sexually assaulted several decades ago while he was a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing of his charges.
The president said Saturday that "The Americans saw the shine, the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanagha is the vote for the confirmation of one of the most assertive legal minds of our time, a lawyer with great achievements in public service," a group of supporters in West Virginia said.
The president touched directly on the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of the Republicans' exit in the middle of the elections.
"Five weeks from the most important choice of our lives.
Although I'm not running myself, I'm actually running," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump claims that democracy seeks to "provide resistance and hinder".
The first key procedural vote in the CNN Senate is expected not later than Friday, a senior official of the Republican Party said.
Hundreds lost their lives in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to increase
At least 384 people died, many of them collected by huge waves that hit the beaches, when large earthquakes and tsunamis hit the island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered because of a beach festival in the city of Paul on Friday, when waves were up to six feet (18 m) high and hit the coast in the evening, bringing many to death and destroying everything they found their way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the danger of tsunami was announced yesterday, people were still dealing with their business on the beach and they didn't run away immediately, and they were killed," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson of the Indonesian disaster relief agency, said in return to Jakarta.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he carried cars, balloons, houses, he hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled over the open sea at 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people got on trees and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in the city of Pala.
Photographs from the air, issued by the disaster agency, show a multitude of destroyed buildings and shops, destroyed and destroyed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Supporting continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes struck an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy of a massive earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the energy of an atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geographical position of the city, located on the edge of the long, narrow bay, increased the strength of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as a "widen" and said it was ruined by thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels.
The bodies of several victims were found under the ruins of broken buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said that victims and damage could be larger along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the area of Dongal, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications "were completely cut off without any information" from Dongale, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live here," they said in the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the endangered areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get even worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticized because it did not report that the tsunami hit Pala, although officials said the waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
The amateur records distributed on social networks show a man on the top floor who panics at the coming tsunamis.
Within a few minutes the water wall hit the coast, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the video immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have caused the disappearance of power that has cut off communications about Palu, making saving efforts by the authorities difficult.
The military began sending cargo planes with humanitarian aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuations still need food and other basic supplies.
The city airport is reopened only for humanitarian flights and will be closed by October.
President Yoko Widodo has scheduled a visit to the evacuation centres in Palou on Sunday.
The number of victims of Indonesia's tsunami has risen to over 800.
It's so bad.
Although World Vision's staff have certainly arrived from Dongale in Pal, where the employees are located in the tents erected in the yard of the office, they witnessed the scenes of destruction on the way, said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's so bad.
Even when relief groups began to take the first steps to alleviate the disaster, there was a complaint that foreign highly qualified humanitarian workers were not allowed to travel to Paul.
According to Indonesian regulations, the flow of foreign resources, stock and people is only possible if the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the territorial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'okay, this is a national disaster', we will be open to international aid, but that status has not yet been declared."
As the second night of the earthquake and tsunami falls on Friday, friends and families of the missing still hope that their loved ones will be miraculously saved and that their tragic story in this natural disaster will be relieved.
On Saturday, the boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the survivors freed a woman who had been trapped for two days by her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, an Indonesian paraglading team coach, trained two missing paragladers in the eyes of the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped in Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagija, were his students.
"As an older member of the paragliding team I bear my emotional burdens," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that hours after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa's hotel spread through the circles of the paragloderer desperately sent whatsApp messages to the competitors in Palu who participated in the festival on the beach.
However, his messages had only one grey hook, instead of two blue hooks.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
The thieves took $26,750 while filling the ATMs in the Newport on the Levee complex.
On Friday morning, the thieves stole $26,750 from Brinka's employee, who filled a ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a police report in Newport.
The car driver emptied the ATM in the fun complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, the other man ran behind Brin's employee and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be delivered.
The witnesses saw more suspects running from the scene, standing in the news, but the police did not specify the number of incidents involved.
All who have any information about their identity should contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: reper rename in Ye
Reper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Posting a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "It will be previously known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been known for some time under the title Ye and used the title for his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change occurred before his performance at the Saturday Night Live show, where the promotion of his new Yandhi album is expected.
He replaced the singer Arian Grande who cancelled the performance for "emotional reasons," the author of the show said.
In addition to the abbreviation of his current professional name, West earlier said that this word had religious significance for him.
"I believe 'yes' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year as he discussed the title of the album with the radio leader Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm me, it's us.
It came from Kanye, which means the only, to only Ye – which is the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of what we are."
He's one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known under the names of Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West's co-worker, JAY-Z, also used versions with or without letters and large letters.
AMLO in Mexico swore not to use the army against civilians
The elected president of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore that he would never use military force against civilians while the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of revenge against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that "he will never use the army to submit to the Mexican people."
The army shot peaceful demonstrations on the market in October 2, 1968, killing even 300 people at the time when the left-wing student movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to provide support to young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunity to train young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding for artistic intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research in that field, the investor and artist of artistic intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said.
The comments came after various parts of the US authorities issued releases of artificial intelligence, although the United States generally does not have an official strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: their goal is to be the first in the field of artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"The double budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are looking for a new breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Double funds could double the chances of next great achievements in the field of artistic intelligence happening in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "Sustained Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and a new world order", published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most outstanding artistic intelligence companies, Face+.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an artistic intelligence system that was superior to the most rated American Othello player, and later he was executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Google Chinese border.
Lee gave recognition to earlier American government technological contests such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for advanced defence research projects and asked when planning the next contests on which future visionaries could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to make enormous efforts to get government subsidies, Lee said.
"It's not taking China's academic leaders away, it's doing corporates," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed brilliant individuals from the university in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think you should automatically offer green maps to doctors from the field of artistic intelligence," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued its plan to develop the art intelligence of a new generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences grants grants to people in academic institutions in a similar way that the National Scientific Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year in the United States, the Defence Department formed the Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which seeks to include partners from the industry and the academic community, and the White House published the formation of the Electoral Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion for an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the National Scientific Foundations, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in the research of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, American legislation which sought to form the Commission's national security for artistic intelligence does not do anything for months.
Macedonians vote on the referendum on changing the name of the country
Macedonian citizens voted on Sunday's referendum to change the country's name in "The Republic of Northern Macedonia", a step that would resolve a multi-decenal dispute with Greece that blocked their membership in the European Union and NATO alliance.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name is the occupation of its territory and has put a veto on their entry into NATO and the EU.
Two governments have reached an agreement on the proposed name in June, but nationalist opponents claim that this could endanger the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Djorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised the question of whether the referendum would come out at least 50 percent, which is necessary to make the referendum valid.
The question on the ballot paper was: "Are you a member of NATO and the EU by accepting an agreement with Greece?"
Candidates of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, claim that this is the price Macedonia, one of the countries created by the collapse of Yugoslavia, deserves to pay for entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they could live freely within the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us," said Oliver Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament said that they would be guided by the result of the vote and that the result would be decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament would be needed to change the name.
The State Election Commission said there was no report of irregularities up to 1 hour in the afternoon.
However, output was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of voters went to the elections.
"I came to vote for my children, we have a place in Europe," said José Tanevski (62), a voter in Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Duško voted at the Macedonian referendum on the change of names, which could open their way for membership in the NATO Alliance and the European Union, in Austria, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small stage and dragged chairs in front of the tents that were torn apart by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads raised, not on the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor, but a proud country.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian community."
Prime Minister Zaev said membership in the NATO alliance would bring over the necessary investment in Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is above 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will vote 'for' because more than 80 per cent of our population is for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after inserting the papers.
He said the result of "for" would be "the confirmation of our future."
The poll published in the Macedonian Institute for Political Research on Monday said that 30 to 43% of the voter will participate in the referendum – which is below the required output.
According to a second survey conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they'd vote for.
In order for the referendum to be successful, it takes a 50 percent turnout plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the Western government since it came to power last May.
See: Player Manchester City Sergio Aguero passes through the entire Brighton defense and achieves goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have rid themselves of Brighton's defenses in the 2nd Manchester City win against Brighton at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It was very easy when Aguero scored a goal in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a ball in the middle of the field at the start of the action.
He ran between the three Brighton defense players before he found himself in the open field.
Aguera then surrounded three green suits.
He ran around a defensive player and was faster than a few on the edge of Brighton's goal.
Then he added to the left, finding Sterling.
The English attacker used his first shot in a prison space to return the ball to Agueru, who had right-handedly conquered the Golman of Brighton Matthew Ryan by hitting the right-hand side of the network.
"Aguero had some foot problems," Coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's the way it was.
We're lucky he scored a goal at that point."
But Sterling was the one who gave the aliens an initial advantage in the Prime Minister League.
He scored a goal in 29 minutes.
In that action, Aguero took a ball deep into Brighton's field.
He added Leroy Saneu on the left.
Sane touched a few times before sending Sterling to the goal.
The invincible attacker threw the ball into the net before he slipped out of the field.
The city is fighting Hoffenheim in the group phase League Championship at 12:55 on Thursday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a game with no competitive significance against Rockies
Since the Nationals were eliminated in the elimination game, there was no reason to insist on another match.
But competing Scherzer hopes he'll take a position Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies, who have a game of advantages over Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, are still in high school.
Rockies at least have a direct passage for the 5:2 victory against the Nationals on Friday, but they still try to win the first title in the league.
"Although we don't play for anything, at least we can go out in the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with fans and other teams will probably be at the highest level compared to all other years.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in those conditions?"
Nationals still need to publish the initial team on Sunday, but they're supposed to let Scherzer throw in that situation.
Scherzer, who would have been the 34th time to start the game, trained on Thursday and threw it on Sunday when he usually rested.

Trump held a meeting in West Virginia
The president briefly referred to the situation regarding the election of his candidate for the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugha, as he spoke of the importance of the Republican's election in half-term.
"All we've done will be on the dice in November.
We're five weeks from the most important choice of our lives.
These are one of the great, the great – although I did not run, I am actually a candidate because I fight everywhere for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on, "See these horrible, horrible groups of radical Democrats, that's what's happening right now.
And they are determined to restore power using all possible ways, see evil, dirty games.
No harm will come to those who are afflicted by it, so that they may gain power and control. They will have power and control over what they wish, and We will not give them that which they desire.
The Democrats, he said, are in the mission of "responsibility and disturbances".
"And you've seen it in the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats "serious, evil, and dishonest."
He quoted a democratic senator and a member of the Senate Judicial Commission, Diane Feinstein, as encouraging the public to act out loud.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leave the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, I am waiting. That was the worst language of the body that I have ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer accepts different positions.
She is intolerant to those who express their opinion
When Momentum activists in my local party border voted to censor me, I wasn't surprised at all.
Besides, I am the last in a number of Labour Members of parliament who were told not to welcome, and all because we expressed our opinion.
My colleague in parliament Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censors criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby.
The importance of responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, and it is ironic that these are similar problems that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
News from a meeting of the Nottingham East Labour Party's border "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During the eight years I spent as a local Labourer member of parliament, the meetings on Friday night were mostly just like that.
Unfortunately, the tone of many meetings today is not the same and the promise of "more kind, gentler" policy has long been forgotten, and the question is whether it has ever been.
It became increasingly evident that different opinions were not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion was assessed on the basis of whether the party's leaders were acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues I believed to share similar political positions, began to expect me to make 180-degree reverses and take positions I would never agree with, whether it was about national security or the single market of the European Union.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – it’s accompanied by an insult on social networks, a call for removal from the party, condemning the policy of the centre and telling me I shouldn’t be in the labyrinth party.
And it's not just me.
On the contrary, I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments are mostly of political nature to me.
I'm amazed by the professionalism and determination of a colleague who's been carrying on a daily life with a bunch of sexist or racist insults, but they don't withdraw.
Something that disappointed me most in this political era is how these levels of insult have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should care for the culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different positions and any vote of non-confidentialness or changes in the rules of the party's selection is being narrowed down.
I've got a lot of advice, and for the last two years, they've been telling me to raise my head, be less loud, and then I'm gonna be fine.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago because of the lack of Prime Minister Thatcher's government that literally reduced my primary school students, I have been trying to assume that better public services to those who are most needed, either as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, including the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused with my political positions and areas of conflict with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would order that, when the country falls to Brexit, which is going to threaten the homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand why someone would waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the main message that I have is not directed to Momentum in Nottingham, but to voters in my election unit, whether members of the Labour Party or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise you that threatening me by removing from the party or political triggers will not prevent me from acting in the way I think it is in the best interest of all of you.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Father Father on top
Two late attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr has won a winning victory in this exciting game of days at the Tennant's Prime Minister League.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only unbeatable of ten teams.
In the end, the home team took the victory thanks to the superior defense, as well as the larger number of opportunities used, and coach Peter Murchie had reason for satisfaction.
"So far we've been tested in games and we're still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayru every honour, they took advantage of their opportunities better than us."
Try Grant Naderson in 14 minutes who converted Frazier Climo, gave the advantage to Ayr, but he was the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, whom the Warriors let him play, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerous advantage and Jason Baggot caught the unconquered attempt.
Climo's pendulum increased Ayra's leadership before, just before half-time, he made a solo attempt to score from 17:5 to Ayr at half-time.
But Melrose's second half started well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, who turned Baggot, reduced leadership to five points.
Then there was a long interruption due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which they carried out on the carriers, and Ayr continued to increase the advantage of the attempt by Stafford McDowall, which turned Climo.
Captain Ayra's deputy, Blair Macpherson, then got the yellow card, and Melrose again used a number of powers with an unresolved attempt by Bruce Colvin, after a period of intense pressure.
However, the hosts returned and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card due to the crash over the climate without a ball. MacPherson reached the touch down from the penalty line behind the incoming Ayra mill.
Climo turned, as he did from the beginning of the sequel, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's punch into a prison space and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth host's attempt.
The Still game series star prepares for a new career in the restaurant industry
The Still game series star, Ford Kieran, is preparing to move to the hosting industry after learning that it is appointed as the director of the company of licensed restaurants.
A 50-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC series that he writes about and plays together with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last in the series and it seems Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of the company Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the news, although the source of the Scottish Sun's journal stated that Kiernan wanted to be involved in the "gross restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, who has no exit to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol the seabed in La Paz.
In public buildings there are the winds of the oceanic flag.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are intertwined with the slogan: "We have the right to the sea.
Returning the exit to the sea is our duty."
Throughout Bolivia's land, a strong memory of the coast that they lost for Chile's blood is flooding around natural resources in the 19th century – as well as a desire to refuel the Pacific.
These hopes may be the biggest in the last few decades, while Bolivia expects the judgement of the International Court of Justice of the first October after five years of the council.
"Bolivia has caught the edge, in the spirit of unity and mood, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia's diplomat.
Many Bolivians will view the judgement of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will judge for Bolivia and argue that – after a decade of grueling negotiations – Chile must agree to negotiations on Bolivia's sovereign exit to the sea.
Here's Morales, a charismatic Bolivian president of native origin, who is faced with a controversial fight for a re-election next year, also plays a major role in the issue of the verdict that will be brought on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it's unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and that it will change a little even if it decides.
The body of the United Nations with its seat in the Netherlands has no power to assign Chilean territory and has stated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the verdict was made only six months after the last arguments were heard indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of making progress in the Bolivian case, for the last four years, it may have been delayed.
"The problem of exit to the sea has been conquered by current Bolivian authorities," Zarate said.
Morales' wartime rhetoric killed the rest of Chilean good will, it's gone.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at one time, but it will be very difficult to hold those negotiations after this.
These two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, Bolivian representative of The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put a point on 139 years of non-conformity to mutual satisfaction," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America's most popular presidents – used the issue of going to sea as a political stick.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to go out on the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to realize that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no disarmament until they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would not stop nuclear weapons until they believed in Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made at the Singapore summit between the conflicted leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared on the border to re-launch nuclear negotiations, more than three months after Singapore and a meeting with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri says it's just letting the dreams go that the continuation of the sanctions and opposition to the U.S. declaration ending the Korean war will never throw North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not ready to agree with the declaration until Pjonggang takes significant steps towards disarmament.
And Kim and American President Donald Trump want a second summit.
The government, however, is skeptical when it comes to the seriousness of Pjongang's rejection of the nuclear arsenal that that country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit of Kim and Trump.
The latest series of huge hats presented in Paris' fashion magazines that you will soon see in the nearby shopping street
If you want to increase the collection of hats or completely protect the sun, you are in the right place.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of decomposed hats on the tracks of their Spring and Summer 2019 editions, featuring everything in Paris's fashion week.
Extremely impractical hats have won Instagram this summer, and these designers have shown their impressive creations on fashion trails.
Valentine's most outstanding piece was the over-exposed hat with a wide pernum round that swallowed the head of the model.
Among the other glamorous additions were skulls with beautiful stone, magic hats, even pineapple, but their purpose is not to keep your head from cold.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks and that in time for Halloween.
Many of the hairy masks had hairy lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than in high fashion.
One creation looked like a diving equipment with a trigger and a mask, and the other reminded of a cornet with a melted ice cream.
And if you're among those who follow the trend of attracting attention – you're lucky.
Those who follow fashion predict that huge hats could be found on nearby shopping streets.
Huge hats came after La Bombe, a broken hat with a two-step radius seen on many stars, from Rihanne to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult brand that invented this very impractical hat that flooded social networks, sent another great creation on the runway – a broken beach bag that is almost as big as the model it wore.
The Zagastonarangasta bag of rafia with rations and white leather lunch was highlighted in detail by Jacquemus La Riviera collection for spring and summer 2019 in Paris's fashion week.
The founder of the famous Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive at the shops in time for the next summer, since the designer left such a huge impression it would be difficult to ignore the demand for pre-specified fashion supplements."
John Edward: Knowing the language is of key importance to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland can be commended for their outstanding academic achievements, and this continued in 2018 with a new series of outstanding results in the studies, which has further strengthened individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, this school, which represents the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strives to provide the best level of service to its students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further education, a chosen career and a place in the society of the world's citizens.
As an educational sector that can devise and implement its own teaching plan and programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable the subject of the cadets in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language that understands it hits his head.
If you speak to him in his language, it will give him a heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build good relations and trust with people from other countries.
According to the results of this year's exam, we see that the languages at the top of the league table, with the highest pass ratings in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students learning foreign languages received an A assessment at the final high school exam.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72% of students received an A assessment from the Mandarin language in the secondary school, while 72% of those learning German, 69% of those learning French and 63% of those learning Spanish also received an A assessment.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key skills that will undoubtedly be needed for children and young people in the future.
Languages, as elective objects, are now treated in the same way as STEM objects (natural sciences, technology, machinery and mathematics) and in independent schools programs, and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17 percent of the reasons why employers had been making jobs more difficult were just the lack of people who know languages.
So knowing foreign languages is becoming increasingly necessary for young people to prepare for their future careers.
With more and more potential jobs for which knowledge of foreign languages is needed, this skill is necessary in the world of globalisation.
No matter what career someone chooses, if he knows another language, he'll have a real advantage in the future because it's a lifelong skill.
They will be able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a person who speaks more languages in front of competition.
According to a survey carried out by YouGo among over 4,000 British in 2013, 75 percent did not know how to speak another language well enough to conduct the conversation, while French was the only language spoken by two-digit percent, 15 percent.
That's why investing in foreign language learning is important for today's children.
Knowing more languages, especially those used in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
Every school in Scotland is different when it comes to language learning.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important to Great Britain by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, there will always be several languages from which you can choose in independent schools, with expert teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an environment for learning that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what lies ahead.
At this time it cannot be denied that in the global business environment languages are of key importance for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must certainly be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It needs to be done.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron will debit for Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting is soon over for fans who want to see LeBron James' first performance for Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James would play Sunday in a preseason match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still don't know how many minutes they're gonna play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official website of Lakers.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, claimed that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about plans in six games during President Lakers.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season swords to prepare," he said.
Trump's collection in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump started a series of pre-election meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled collections in the next week, including visits to friendly arranged places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While his voice is waiting for a full-fledged seat in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to increase support in the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate because the Republicans risk losing control of the Congress after the vote in November.
When's Trump's gathering in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's gathering in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for seven hours in the east time on Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's gathering in West Virginia under the live transmission on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about hearings this week about Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court in which it was tense for charges of sexual harassment, and the expected vote in the Senate was postponed within seven days until the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the overarching objective of this series of collections is to help the Republicans achieve a better outcome in the November elections.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign said the meetings this week are held to "give energy to volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial part of his agenda that the president will travel to as many countries as possible as we enter the pre-election campaign season," Reuters's spokesman Trump's campaign, who refused to introduce himself, said.
In Westbanko Arena in Wheeling, tonight's assembly could gather supporters from "Ohia and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday there will be a second time this month, Trump will visit West Virginia, a country in which he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who doesn't stand well in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president came to try to raise his rating in polls," said Simon Haeder, a polytologist at West Virginia University, according to a Reuters report.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team showed the struggle to hold hope before individual matches Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the fours on Saturday afternoon might be exactly what this Ryder shop needed.
Zamaha is a completely invented concept in sport, but one of those in which players truly believe, especially in competitions like this.
What do they think, who's got a turn at the moment?
"They led six points, and now four, so it can be said that it's almost on our side," Jordan Spieth said on his way out.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, four points more, with 12 more in the game.
The Americans, as Speeth says, still believe they have some wind in their wings, and there's much to give them encouragement, between the other forms of Speeth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each one took three points of the four possible.
Speeth was brilliant from the first to the last blow and led by his example.
Celebrations became louder during his round to finally play a key blow for the unsolved result in the fourth match when he and Thomas were behind two after two.
His final blow with a 15-hole match was expected by a similar shout, one that reflects the belief that there is hope for the American team.
"You just have to give everything to yourself and take care of your sword," Spieth said.
That's all that's left of these players now.
18 holes that can bring glory.
The only players from several points from Speeth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly Ryder's main story.
An unusual but unacceptable European couple got all four matches and games without mistakes.
Moliwood was the only couple who didn't play God's hits on Saturday afternoon, and they avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The game that has been shown so far also the way in which they share energy with the loud audience has been consolidated in the position of main favorites on Sunday and there are no more popular players than Fleetwood or Molinaria who could take a potential European victory while the sun rises above the Le Golf National Club.
It would be best for both at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still early to talk about European celebration.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly took control of Sergei Garcius, a hero playing with four balls that morning when he was playing in a couple with Alex Noren.
One divine blow and two doubles in the first nine holes buried Spain and Sweden in a hole from which to the end they could not even dig.
But on Sunday, no one can help you get out of your hole.
Games with four balls and fours are so fascinating to look closely at because of the interaction between couples, advice that they give and that they don't give, and the ways in which the strategy can be changed at the moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a great advantage before the final day, but this four-day session has shown that the U.S. team has a desire to fight in which some people suspected, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe leads 10:6 before the last day Ryder bath
Europe will enter the last Ryder Cup with a significant priority, as after Saturday's matches with four balls and fours won the 10-6th priority over the United States.
The inspired couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, first led with two victories over unsatisfied Tiger Woods, increasing the current score in the Le Golf National Club at four points.
Europeans Thomas Bjorn fought to restore the trophy that they lost in Hazeltine's golf club two years ago, dominated inaccurate Americans in the morning game with four balls and won a series of 3:1.
The United States has provided greater resistance to the square tournament, winning two matches, but they could not reduce the balance.
Team Jim Furyk has to win eight points in 12 single matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debit who won four points in a row, while he and Molinari, called Molliwood after a fantastic weekend, are just another couple in the history of Ryder Cup that won four points in the first four matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the game with four balls, they made great compositions and mastered the tired Woods and American deputizer Bryson Dechambeau with even more convincing 5:4.
Woods, who pulled through two matches on Saturday, was flashing for moments, but now he lost 19 of the 29 matches in a game with four balls and fours and seven in a row.
Juston Rose, who rested during the morning game with four balls, went back to Henry Stenson's fourth tournament and suffered defeat 2:1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepk – the first and third in the world.
Europe did not all go according to the plan of this pleasant day in the south-west of Paris.
The triple winner of the Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas tournament set the goal for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They chose the victory of 2:1 over John Rahmo and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game, to return and win Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4:3 in fours, after losing the first two holes.
Only two times in the history of Ryder bathed some team came back after the left of four points in front of a single match, although Fury's side defending the title, enough unsolved result to keep the trophy.
However, after two days in another place, it seems that they could not carry out an attack on Sunday.
North Korea advises "no talk" about unilateral disarmament if there is no trust
North Korean Foreign Minister said on Saturday to the United Nations that extending the sanctions deepens her mistrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country will not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Hu told the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant measures to show good will", such as the interruption of nuclear and missile testing, the dismantling of nuclear polygons and the promises that it will not increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, there is no appropriate US response," he said.
"Without trust in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there will be no talk about our first unilateral disarmament."
Although Ri reiterated the well-known claims of North Korea against Washington's "step-by" approach to denuclearization that North Korea would be rewarded for progressive steps, his statement was that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization from the game as Pjonngang earlier did.
Ri was invited to a joint statement by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump at the first summit held between the current president of the United States and North Korea's leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump was committed to providing North Korea with a security guarantee.
North Korea is seeking a formal ending of the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has announced that Pjongang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington also responded to calls to mitigate international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States does not give up "denuclearization first of all" and increases the level of pressure on sanctions to achieve its goal in force, even in the face of the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The thought that sanctions can throw us on our knees is letting the dreams of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that extended sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the American leader spoke of in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister made three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added, "If this problem of denuclearization was negotiated with South Korea, rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such an unexplained position."
Yet, the tone of Rio's speech was drastically different from last year when at the UN General Assembly, he said shooting US ground rockets in North Korea was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "a rocket" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations Trump, who threatened last year to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarmament, but said that much more must be done and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea implements denuclearization.
On Wednesday Trump said he had not set a time frame for this, saying, "If it is necessary, let it take two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia claim that UN Security Councils should reward Pjonngang for the steps they have taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be strictly and without allowing them to be carried out until complete, final, confirmed denuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea that have been applied since 2006, in an effort to disable funding for nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Rijeu outside the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pjongang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
He's been visiting North Korea three times this year, but his last trip hasn't gone well.
In July he left Pyongyang with the words that progress was made, and North Korea condemned him only a few hours later for "gangster demands".
North Korea at a meeting with Moon this month promised to dismantle a missile polygon as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes "relevant measures".
He said Kim told him that there are "relevant measures" that require security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
The new course at Harvard University this year aims to make students get more sleep in an effort to eradicate the increasingly popular cat culture of learning "all night with the help of caffeine".
One academic observed that students of the leading university in the world are often ignorant of their basic concerns.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has set up a course he considers to be the only species in the United States.
The inspiration to start this course was given after a speech that held about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"At last a girl came to me and said, 'Why are you telling me this just now, my senior year?'
She said that no one ever told her how important a dream was – which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course this year is held for the first time provides the basis for how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and sports outcomes, as well as to improve their overall situation.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University Health Service, said the university decided to introduce a course after it was observed that during the week students suffered from a serious lack of sleep.
The uniform course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part is a picture of the room in the student's home and students should click on the coffee cups, curtains, patches and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as about the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performances and the meaning of the routine before bedtime.
The second part tells participants that a long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then the campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that this will not temporarily change the behavior of the students.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know what health effects it has on smoking cigarettes," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride because of "the awakening night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to the lack of sleep becoming a major problem.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and that of quality, should be "secret weapon" students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even against a higher kilogram, because as a result of a lack of sleep, the brain passes into the starving regime, so they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Cheisler to come up with a course after he attended one of his lectures last year at Harvard.
He says that this course opened his eyes and inspired him to rely on his maintenance at the level of the entire campus.
It is hoped that the next step is to ask all post-graduates to carry out a similar study programme before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended to the students to consider setting up an alarm in time for sleep and awakening and to take account of the harmful effects of "blue light" that emit electronic screens and LED lighting and can disrupt the circus rhythm, thereby leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Mengin goal defeated Gerrard's team
The Rangers experienced another depressed defeat in the guests when Dolly Menga sent a rescue team named Steven Gerrard to a 1-0 defeat from Livingstone.
The team from Ibrox wanted to take the first victory in the guests after the February 4-1 triumph in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team made Gerrard a second defeat in 18 matches, leaving his team eight points behind the unsuccessful Ledbrokes Prime Minister League, Hearts.
Manga hit seven minutes before half an hour ago, and the uninhaled rank of Rangers never came close to equality.
While the Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third and behind are Hibernate only because of the nude difference.
The Rangers could face additional problems after the line judge Calum Spence had to show help when he was shot from the side of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team that exceeded Ayr and placed himself in the semifinals of Betfred bath.
On the other hand, Holt defined himself as the same eleven players of Livingstone who last week took the point of Hearts and would be thrilled by the way his well-trained team pressed opponents at every step.
Maybe the Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston made better use of his time with the ball.
It was a little short of reaching goal just two minutes after Menga was first added to the empty space sent Scott Pittman to the goal of Allan McGregor, but the middle-field player missed a big chance and shot next to the goal.
Deeply free blow Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halket, but his partner in defense Alan Lithgow just managed to shut up next to the goal, the end of the station.
Rangers managed to take control, but their game in the last third gave more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he was supposed to get a penalty in 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian request.
The Rangers achieved only two hits on the goal in the first half, but the former goalman Ibrox, Liam Kelly, without any major problems, defended the blow with the head of Lassane Coulibaly and shook the silence that directed Ovie Ejaria.
Although the first goal of Livingstone in the 34th minute may not reflect the real relationship of the force in the course of the game, no one can deny that it was deserved, if for nothing else, then because of the effort made.
The Rangers couldn't re-elect with a deep free hit of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added a ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard reacted to the interruption of the introduction of Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly and this replacement almost immediately resulted when the wing player hired Morelos, but impressive Kelly ran off his line and blocked him.
However, Livingstone continued to instruct guests to play exactly the way it suited them, with long matches of Lithgov and Halket.
Holt's team had a chance to increase the advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor was well held up and defended Jacobs' attack, and then Lithgov from the corner sent a ball next to the goal.
A replacement player named Rangers, Glenn Middleton, at the end of the game, asked for another penalty when he hooked up with Jacobs, but Thomson didn't react again.
Almanah: Geiger's counter inventor
And now, the station from our Sunday Morning Almash: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that in time will become a device known as Geiger's counter.
In addition to being one of the main science protests, Geiger's counter has its place in pop culture, as in the 1950's Call Koronad film, in which they played the seemingly incredible Cuban scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's counter, used to locate radioactive minerals as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms in your ears thanks to the radioactivity in minerals."
Evans, "Yeah, that's a dick!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" the malignant cells.
A new cancer vaccine could teach an immune system to "see" the malignant cells and then kill them.
The vaccine teaches an immunological system to identify malignant cells as part of therapy
The procedure includes removing immunological cells from patients and changing them in the laboratory
They can thus "see" a protein that is common to many types of cancers, and then they are reinjected
The test vaccine has shown promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The cancer of the ovaries of a woman who has received treatment with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise malignant cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves removing immunological cells from the patient, processing them into the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein HER2, and reinjecting them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American Institute for Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "helps the growth of several types of cancers" including breast cancer, ovaries, lung and colorectal, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to removing immunological cells from patients and the "learning" of how to target small cells was effective in treating one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West gave a loud speech to support Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after his performance in the SNL show.
He didn't have a good time.
Kanye West was expelled from the study during the Saturday Night Live show following a slow performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for 2020.
After performing his third song, called Ghost Town, that night he was wearing a hat with the title "Make America Big", insulting the Democrats and talking again about his support for Trump.
"I've talked so many times to white people who say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?
So if I didn't care about racism, I'd have moved away from America long ago," he said.
SNL launched a sketch show in which Matt Damon acted and in which the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's judicial commission on allegations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the video of West's speech was shared by comics Chris Rock on social networks.
It's not clear if Rock tried to mock West by setting up the video.
West also complained to the public that he had a hard time behind the scenes because of his hat.
"They chased me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on your head."
They've been teasing me!
And then they say to me that I'm upset," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see what it looks like?" adding that "it's going to turn Superman's coat because it means you can't order me.
Try love."
His comments sparked public glimmering at least twice, and the members of the SNL's show were apparently touched, he handed over Variety, while one person who was present said, "The entire studio was completely shut up."
They brought Westa as a replacement for Arian Grande, whose former partner, Reper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
The West confused many with the song's performance and loves it thrown into Perrier's mouth.
Westa supported the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest souls: Thank you for not being in front of the villains."
But the show leader Karen Hunt tweeted that the West was simply "what he really was and that it was absolutely beautiful".
"But I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "art") whom I believe he has embraced and spreads ideology that harms my society.
He's free.
We are," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, saying that he will now "be previously known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's foot, who's also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A colleague of the reper Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion, and of course a dead music legend Prince changed his name into a symbol, and then "an artist previously known as Prince".

The star of the series "Games of the throne", Kit Harington condemned toxic cat culture
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow, who beats a mule in a violent medieval fantasy, HBO series of the throne game.
However, the actor (31) broke down on the stereotype of the hero's sword, saying that such roles on the screen mean that boys often think they need to be rough to be respected.
In a statement on Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of a toxic cat culture at the time #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married a partner from Leslie Rose's throne (31), admitted that he had a "strong need" to deal with this problem.
"My personal question at the moment is quite a matter of concern to me – what did we make a mistake in presenting manhood?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the spread of the toxic cat of culture because of the depiction of men.
He said, “What is born, and what is the matter with you?”
What is it that teaches us on TV and on the streets why young people think they have to fit into a certain pattern of men's behavior?
I think it's actually one of the main issues of our time — how can we change it?
Because obviously something went wrong for young people."
He also admitted in the interview that he would not agree to the pre-series or classes of the Games of the throne after the end of next summer, saying he "ended with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in the play piece Sam Shepard True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently discovered that he believed that he had met his wife, Rose, the best thing that happened in a series of games of the throne.
"In this series I met my wife, so it can be said that she gave me the future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love partner of Kitt's character Jon Snow in this fantastic series that won Emmy's award.
Couple married in June 2018 at the possession of Leslie's parents in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% leap in the number of new cases of people living with HIV and the past.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been hit, health officials say.
Some 40,000 new cases were recorded only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted through sexual relations, which is a change in the previous situation.
In the past, HIV has usually rapidly spread to some parts of China as a result of a virus-infected blood transfusion.
However, the number of people getting HIV in this way is almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sexual relations is a burning problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China is no longer considered illegal since 1997, but they say that the discrimination of LGBT is a very widespread person.
Studies estimate that due to conservative country perceptions, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men eventually marry women.
The transmission of the virus is often due to inappropriate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of a plan to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denied the allegations that one of her staff had published information about the Republican senators, condemning "dangerous lies" and "theorie conspiracy"
US MP Maxine Waters denied the statement that one of her staff has published personal data from three US Republican senators on Wikipedia's sites.
The Democratic MP from Los Angeles claims that these claims are posted by experts and the website of the ultra-trading wing.
"Liars, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a Twitter release.
The published information allegedly included home addresses and phone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatcha, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network on Thursday, and they were published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill at the hearing of the Senate commission on sexual harassment instructions against the Supreme Court candidate Bretta Kavanaugha.
The information was published at some point after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The conservative web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publication is linked to the Waters office and published information about its staff member, Hill reported.
"This unsubstantiated claim is a completely incorrect and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security are threatened by these false and inaccurate claims – is not in any way responsible for completing this information.
This baseless claim is a completely inaccurate and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly called for internet judgment, which was issued by former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This neglect goes away with anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This concludes that she does not have the temper required for a Congressman.
When he accuses someone of something he hasn't done, he can't be angry.
It can't be a trap.
He must not justify the motives of the accused.
They must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to the criticisms of Judge Kavanaugh's democrats, who were accused of acting too angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was running for Waters in the mid-term elections, also announced via Twitter.
"A great thing if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said her office warned "the relevant competent institutions and judicial authorities about these false claims".
"We will make sure the perpetrators are discovered," she continued, "and that before the law they are responsible for all their procedures that are unstable and dangerous to all my staff members."
Review by Johnny English again in action – a milk spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It has already become a tradition to look for a subtext about Brexit in every new film with British theme, which can also be applied to this follow-up to the Francisce of Satirical Action Comedy about Johnny English – which began in 2003 with the realization of "Johnny English" and returned to screens in 2011 with "Johnny English: born again".
Will the ironic autosatery about how clearly we are useless be a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, bluish, incapacitated Johnny English rubber face has been given a new opportunity to fry something – with his name more than anything else telling him that it is a common comical creation designed for cinema-based audiences with no English language.
It's, of course, about a crazy secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims at the top of the glamour, wears a little Clouseau, Mr Bean's drummer and a bit of that guy who played only one note in the context of the "Chariots of Fire" theme melody at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
It was also originally founded on a passenger and an international man by the great mystery that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
One or two scenes of the newest is a good one.
I liked it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter trained in the medieval Vite armor and when the rotor blades briefly talk about his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is obvious, but humor feels weak and in a very strange way superior, especially now that "serious" film brands like 007 and the Invincible Mission add comic elements.
The notion is that it's a humor for children, not for adults, and for me, the unwinded adventures of Johnny English are not inventive and made like Atkinson's gays in the style of the silent movies like Mr. Bean.
Now it's a very current topic that the Great Britain is in serious trouble.
Hacker infiltrated the British super-secret network of spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, at the horror of the agent on duty – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop in a glass of water for a Prime Minister, a Pompey, and an affected person who already has a complete breakdown because of a political downturn: Emma Thomson masterfully played this character on Theresa May, but the scenario is rather inconceivable.
Her intelligence consultants inform her that all active spies are compromised and that they will have to hire one of the pensioners.
And that means a smutan Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in a retired institution, but informally holds lessons about how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gays when English holds a spying academy in the way of the "School Hand".
English quickly returns to Whitehall for emergency instructions and to recompute it with former extremely patient partner Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to the commander of the submarine in whose energetic and vocal role Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin are once again in the service of the Secret Service of Her Majesty and fortunately a beautiful fatal woman, Opheli Boulett, interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the trap of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems: criminal Jason Volt, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough are relaunching their diversion of comical adventures: crushed in the canoes, they set on fire an elegant French restaurant, a real chaos breaking up on Voltina's luxury yacht, and English is running a real anarchy trying to get to know Voltina's interior by using hearing aids for virtual reality.
It's obvious that a lot of effort has been put into that last sequence, but no matter how sympathetic and cheerful the whole film was made for the children.
Pretty middle quality.
As in other movies about Johnny English, I can't ask myself: can the British film industry think of any role for Rwana Atkinson that would really show his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to make a plan for the British to work for four days a week, and to be paid in five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyna will consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but were paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the company's bosses to transfer time to workers who save thanks to the AI revolutions by giving them another day off.
Employers would enjoy that kind of three-day weekend – but they would still receive the same pay.
The sources say that this idea would be "assembled" in the party's economic programme and plans to improve the working conditions and rights of workers.
A four-day shift to work week approved the Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A high source from the Labour Party said to Sunday Times: "New policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that fits in with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the party's industrial strategy at all."
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea because the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, this ambition does not support the entire Labour Party.
The Labour Party Portparol said: "The four-day working week is not the party's policy and the party is not considering it".
The opposition officer John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to expose his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined in his desire to take power from the "beautiful director" and "professor" in municipal companies.
The plans of the opposition office also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not recover their total investment because the labs could impose "debts" based on perceived injustices.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in company committees and create inclusive own funds that would allocate 10% of the value of private sector companies to employees for which it is likely to kill annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy is talking about a 60-minute show about whether the FBI investigation could change their opinion.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugha has postponed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court at least one week and raises the question whether the investigation of the office might indicate some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, a "60 minutes" release correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy felt more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I think so, of course," said Kennedy.
"Before the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came up, I asked, 'Did you do that?'
He was unstoppable, determined, unyielding."
But Senator Graham's voice seems to be embellished.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh was formed and a strong charge would be needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett turned it down energetically," Graham added, saying about Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone she calls can't confirm it.
She's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the festival of the citizens of the world, and did he do anything that would reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Festival of World Citizens, an annual music event with a truly impressive list of stars to take place, and an equally impressive goal – to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizens' Festival will gather tens of thousands of people on the big April of the Central Park who will not only enjoy the performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the true goal of this event, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival, which was held for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the global project against poverty, an international group that advocates the elimination of poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight it.
To get a free ticket for the event (except if you are not willing to pay for the VIP card), those who wanted to attend the concert had to do a series of tasks or "work" such as volunteering, sending e-mails to the world leader, phone call and any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal – ending poverty.
But how successful is the project of the World's Citizens with only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Was the idea of awarding people free concert the right way to get people to take action, or just another vision of so-called "clickivism" – when people believe they did something that would change the world by signing a petition on the Internet or tweeting?
Since 2011, the World's Citizens' Initiative has claimed to have marked more than 19 million "action" of their supporters who have relied on a number of different objectives.
They say these actions have forced world leaders to publish promises and political directions that are worth more than $37 billion and will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and the publication of proceeds from their actions, and at least 10 billion dollars has already been allocated or collected.
The group estimates that the funds collected have already had a direct impact on 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key promises are Power savings, an investor's partnership and a realist from Great Britain who promised "to help children grow up to their full potential", promising Rwanda to allocate 35 million dollars to end their poverty, after receiving more than 4700 tweets from the citizens of the world.
"With the support of the British government, the donor, the national governments and the citizens of the world, like you, we can make the social injustice of nutrition become a historical fissure," said Ambassador Moji esne, Tracey Ullman, live concert visitors in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions that called for Britain to improve mother and children's migration, the government announced that it would finance the Power of Nutrition project, whose interventions would affect the lives of 5 million women and children.
In answer to one of the frequently asked questions on their page, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
The people of the world say, "It will be a long and difficult time, and sometimes we will fall and fall.
However, like all major civil rights movements and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are just some of the artists that will take place at this year's New York event, which will lead Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could "block" Russia in energy exports to the Navy – Interior Secretary
Washington can "if necessary" use its Navy to prevent Russian energy exports to third markets, including the Middle East, has discovered Ryan Zinke, the US Secretary of Internal Affairs, and transferred Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russian involvement in Syria – i.e., there are legitimate government calls – is an excuse for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, as they do in Eastern Europe and the centre of South Europe," he said.
And according to the official's statement, there are ways and means of resolving this issue.
"The United States has this option to ensure that the sea corridors remain open together with our Navy or block them if necessary to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at an event whose organizer was the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group called itself "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, finding it to be the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is less and more of the use and replacement of fuels," he said, saying that Russia has only one ingredient, and that its nature depends on fossil fuels.
Statements are coming after the Trump administration's mission to increase the export of oiled natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia with a far more favourable option for European consumers.
To that end, officials of Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unappropriate" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prison" of Moscow.
Moscow has stressed in several instances that the North Stream 2 pipeline is worth 11 billion dollars and that the existing capacity of the pipeline should be doubled to 110 billion cubic metres, exclusively a natural project.
Kremlin claims that the reasons for Washington's fierce opposition to this project are purely economical and that this represents an example of untrustworthy competition.
"I believe that we share the opinion that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should have the option of choosing a supplier," Russian minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The U.S. state has called for Germany's reaction, which has reaffirmed its definition for the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the German Industry Alliance (BDI), urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country blends in our energy supply," said Dieter Kemp, president of the German Industry Alliance (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider seriously" about the presidential candidacy for 2020, Senator of Massachusetts said
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "carefully consider" candidate for president after the next mid-term elections.
During a meeting at the city council in the city of Hollywood in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider the candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, which includes a woman at the top," she said, and transmits the source The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider my candidacy for the president."
Warren called on President Donald Trump during a meeting at the City Council, saying he "is leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was summoned for criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court Judge, Brett Kavanaugh.
In her tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, the results of the poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of the electoral bodies that voted for Warren did not think it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters who will "probably" vote in the state of Massachusetts said the senator should not be running, according to a poll conducted by the Centre for Political Research at the University of Suffolk/list Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed that there is greater support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent of voters supporting the potential candidate and 48 percent against the candidate.
The remaining sound names from the ranks of Democrats discussed in terms of their potential candidates in 2020 are former vice-president Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, as the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin was talking about PTSP Track Palin in a collection of support for Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recruitment in September.
He was arrested and charged with violence in the family after the incident that occurred on Monday night
"What my son goes through, what he goes through after his return, I can connect with what is happening to other families that suffer the consequences of the PTSP and the vulnerability that our soldiers are returning to," said the public at the gathering of President Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a hot topic" and, speaking of his son and other war veterans, added "they come back a little different, return firmly, they return asking whether there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots have given to this country."
He was arrested on Monday in the city of Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with violence in the family -- assault on a woman person, disturbing the reporting of violence in the family and possession of weapons under opiates, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Administration.
18 states, D.C. support the fight against new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the Columbia District support the re-examination of a new U.S. policy that undermines asylum for victims fleeing gangs or family violence.
Representatives from 18 countries and the District submitted a friendly court report in Washington on Friday to support asylum seekers questioning this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's lawsuit against Sessions, which the US Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the Federal Police, has not been discovered.
She said she was being abused by her partner "and violent gang members," but US officials refused her asylum request on July 20th.
She's been detained in Texas.
State lawyers who support Grace explained how the states of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the United States, face a growing problem related to gangs and family violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy annulled the 2014 decision of the Committee on Immigration Complaints, which allowed immigrants who do not have documents and are fleeing violence in the family to submit a request for asylum.
State Prosecutor District of Columbia, General Karl Racine, said in a statement he made on Friday that a new policy "is neglecting decades of state, federal and international law."
"The Federal Law requires that all asylum claims be decided on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the application, and that the chamber thus violates that principle," the friendly report says.
Lawyers continue in the report claim that the police who disable the entry of immigrants harm the US economy, and that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labour force."
In June, State Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges in cases related to migrants to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing violence in the family and gang violence.
"Assil is only available to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear of belonging to a particular race, religion, nationality or social group or for their political opinion," Sessions said in a statement of 11 June speaking about politics.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems, even all the serious problems people face around the world every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in the city of Palu as the number of dead doubles in search of survivors
The situation for survivors is getting worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma comforting her sick little boy at the evacuation centre in the deserted city of Pala.
"Each minute, emergency assistance brings the bodies.
The government is depriving clean water."
People are returning to their broken homes, wandering about in vain, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
Some of the wounded, such as Two Harris, with broken back and shoulder, are located outside the Palu's Military Hospital, where patients are being helped out because of the ongoing severe side effects.
His eyes are filled with tears as he tells how he felt a strong earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to be saved.
I think I've been pushed by the ruins of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press agency, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help and then quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "violence with propaganda"
Seven days after official Chinese newspapers published an ad on four pages in U.S. newspapers, thanking the mutual benefit of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump turned to a paid Chinese newspaper supplement at Des Moines Register, the most sold in Iowa, on Wednesday, after accusing China of joining the US Congress elections to be held on 6 November, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to get involved in the U.S. elections indicates that US officials told Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
And while it is customary for governments to publish ads aimed at promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in the escalating trade war where each other increases import tariffs.
As a countermeasure, earlier Chinese tariffs in this trade war were directed towards exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supports Trump's Republican Party, said in Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and a longtime mayor of Iowa, who is the main exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing has damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a comment published in the Sunday issue of the newspaper Des Moines Register, "now duplicates this violence by publishing propaganda ads in our free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the government of China is exploiting the precious American tradition of freedom of speech and press, placing paid ad in the newspaper Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, on the kiosk located here down the street in Beijing, you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not be able to see any true reflection of the different opinions that people in China may have about China's problematic natural path, bearing in mind that the Chinese media are under the firm stick of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers has declined the offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention the newspaper.
Republicans turn women away from voting in the eyes of mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
Analysts have warned that a large number of the most prominent republicans who are defending and standing with the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, facing several allegations of alleged sexual assaults, will experience negative reactions, especially women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions associated with this issue are very intense, and most Republicans already show that they want to give their voice.
There is no back in these things," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell University School of Syracuse, in an article for the magazine that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said he suspected that what Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) recently asked the FBI to investigate would be enough to put an end to angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and public speaker of the Progressive Group MoveOn, in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called for "newsbar coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate hall, while the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to investigate with Kavanaugha's candidate despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be huge," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say it's already high, which is true.
But it could be higher, especially among undecided female voters in suburbs and among younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who do not like the president, do not vote."
Even prior to Ford's public testimony, in which she filed details of the allegations of alleged sexual assault against a candidate for the Supreme Court's court, analysts were of the opinion that he might have a negative reaction if the Republicans investigate the nomination.
"This has become a big mess for the Great Old Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, broadcasts the NBC News network.
"It is not only the Committee's vote or the final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh will be a judge, it is also the way the Republicans dealt with this issue and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, the leader of the Priorities USA Group, who supports the election of the Democrats.
Yet, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided in terms of whom to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slight slope on the side of Kavanaugh.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believe in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought that Kavanaugh probably lied or definitely during his testimony, while only 30% said that they thought the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other person who made the charge, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Justice Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez reportedly claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court's court showed her genitals while attending parties during their studies at Yale in the 1980s.
Web inventor World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet that will exceed Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web network, is launching a startup aimed at becoming a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid, the manufacturer of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview for the Fast Company, Berners-Lee hoped the intention of Inrupta was "world domination."
"We need to do it right away," he said about the start.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal data store on the network" or POD (personal online data store).
It can contain a list of contacts, a list of obligations, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, they're all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique for the personal data store on the network is that it depends entirely on the user who can access any kind of information.
The company calls it "personal data strengthening."
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea is that the Inrupt company provides sources, processes and relevant skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently becoming Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM's security platform, a number of employee development engineers committed to working on the volunteer project and community.
Since this week, technology engineers around the world can create their decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where all their business models over the night will be completely destroyed.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a statement on Saturday on the Media platform, Berners-Lee wrote that Inruptova "is a mission to secure commercial energy and ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet in 1994 when he founded a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The last few months of Berners-Lee has been a very influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Although Inrupt is running, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration on the occasion of Victorian cross assigned to a priest in World War I
Celebrations in honor of the only Anglican priest who was distinguished by the Victorian cross as a fighter in World War I were celebrated in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won a confession on September 29, 1918 to attack the towns of Bellenglies and Lehaucourt.
But a few days later, he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he had won the largest British military recognition.
On a parade held Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial plate.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the monument was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received his prize.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Vann led his battalion through Canal Saint-Quentin "through a very dense fog and under a strong fire from the battlefield and the gunfire."
Later, he rushed to the fire line and led the water forward with "the greatest hero" before he ran without any help to the Polish top and smashed three of the military squad.
Colonel Vanna died a German sniper in October 4, 1918, a little over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's moves were "something I know I could never achieve, but also something that causes humility."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed the winery after the parade led by the Dutch orchestra Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he feels honored to participate in paradise" and added that "the courage of a true hero shows the support that many will give."
MMA fans who stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead got Pepu Prase
Imagine that, you've been awake all night to watch a series of Bellator 206, so you can't finally be able to watch the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 fights, including six on the main list and showed live during the night on Channel 5 in Great Britain.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just at the moment when Gegard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, the viewers in Great Britain were amazed when the transfer ended Pep Prace.
Many were not impressed that they stayed awake all night until early morning hours just because of the fight.
One Twitter fan described this interruption as "a kind of sick joke."
"It's about a government regulation where it says that at 6 o'clock in the morning this content is inappropriate, and they had to replace it with a children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, vice-president Bellator for marketing and communication, on the question of transmission.
"Pepa Prase," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said he would work on his schedule to include viewers from Britain in the future.
"I think when I talk about reprisal, I think we can probably solve it," Coker said.
"But the transmission is there at six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to realize anything until we have Sunday, when they already have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the break came, they circled over the letters and everything was hostile.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't, it was a matter of government.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, we've tried to give more to our fans, but we've exaggerated.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic driver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that gave him motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old said that only in high school did he realize that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, representing Lauren Laverne, he said he openly spoke about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that what became a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular manager of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, was absent for a few months because of the disease.
Appearing as a waste in Laverne's first show, Daley said that during his growing up he felt "less valuable" than others because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, these feelings of inferior worth and the feeling that I was different were the real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so people don't get disappointed when they eventually find out about his sexuality.
The double winner of the bronze Olympic medals became a very important fighter for the LGBT population and took advantage of its appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt happy that he had the opportunity to speak publicly and because he wanted to give others “hope. ”
The triple world champion said that he was in love with a man, American producer Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 "a surprise."
Daley married Oscar's winner last year, who was 20 years older than him, and said that the difference in years was never a problem.
"When you live so much while you're so young" -- the first time he appeared at the Olympics when he was 14 -- and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
Couples became the parent of Robert Ray Black-Daley's boy in June, and Daley said his "total perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was just about "I have to win the gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals in the Olympic Games.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son wears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 in the year 40 after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said that his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they still had tickets for London in 2012 because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't be here to sit in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held him by the hand while he stopped breathing and only when he really stopped breathing and when he was dead I finally realized he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
"I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of the home audience in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It served as an inspiration for his choice of the first song -- a stream of Heather Small -- which responded to him while he was preparing for the Olympics and from which the twins still pass.
Desert Island Discs is on Radio 4 BBC on Sunday at 11:15 in British summer time.
Mickelson of the shape at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game at Ryder's Cup, but he's gonna have to get back the form so this wouldn't be an invescious shift.
Mickelsson, who plays at the record ball 12th time, Captain Jim Fury has sent to the club in Saturday games with four balls and games in four.
Instead of being at the center of action, as it was often the case for the United States, the fifth major winner spent the day in cheering and improving the field in the game, hoping he would correct what was bothering him.
This 48-year-old, who has never been the best player, even at the top of his career, is not an ideal choice for the Le Golf National demand field, where long unbalanced terrain regularly punishes stray hits.
And if I'm not scared enough, Mikkelson won all four of his games this week in the ninth game on Sunday with British Open, French Molinary champion Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 single games with four points less, come to a hot start, Mikkelson's game could prove absolutely decisive.
Fury said he had confidence in his man, but he couldn't even say anything more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, slammed me in the shoulder and hugged me, and said he would be ready by tomorrow," Fury said.
"He believes in himself very much.
He is a member of the House of Fame and has contributed so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't think I was playing two games.
I figured there'd be more, but that's how it went and we thought it had to go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Falda's record on Sunday by the number of Ryder Cup matches played.
That could mark the end of his career at Ryder's shop where he never fully achieved the level of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven half-times, although Fury said his presence brought a certain immaterial value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, he likes to joke with people and it's great to have such a guy on the team," he explained.
"I think it was fun for younger players to give him a chance, and this week, which was fun to watch.
He's giving a lot more than a crack game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a huge advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage in the last day of the single match Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
The first time he appeared at a game in the city of Valderram in 1997, when the party whose captain was Seve Ballesteros had the advantage of five points over the Americans, but ended the competition with a sharp difference of 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
"You always remember that we had a great advantage in Valderrama, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won," said Bjorn, thought to have seen the 2018 team, who won the result 5-3 on Friday and yesterday led 10-6 on the Le Golf National field.
So the story and everyone on that team will show me that this isn't over.
You're going to finish tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get points on the table.
We have a goal, and it's that we try to win this trophy and it stays focused.
All the time I'm talking, I'm focused on 12 players on our side, but we're very well aware of what's over-way on the other side -- the biggest players in the world."
Enthralled by the performance of his players at the heavy golf tournament, Bjorn added, "I would never let this take me.
Tomorrow's a new day.
They're on a single game tomorrow, and that's something else.
It's great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when you're there alone, you're testing the ultimate possibilities of yourself as a golfer.
It's a message you have to convey to the players - give the most of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and he also has to do the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague Jim Fury will ask his players to play better individually than they played in couples, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Suryk himself was on both sides of those big rounds last day, since he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser after Europe carried out "a miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered when asked how Ben Crenshaw, a 1999 captain, encouraged his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very beginning, like what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When it comes to such a venture, he creates a great pressure on the middle game.
We formed our position in line with that and we've prepared the guys so we can try to do some magic tomorrow, you know."
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to conduct a counterattack and facing Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahmo, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the upper half.
"I went with this group of guys in this position because I think she can cover it all by the end," Bjorn said about selecting the players for singles.
New German warship waiting again
The new frigate of German Navy was to be released in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War, but will not reach for at least another year due to system failure and extraordinary costs, local media reported.
The launch of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ ship, a leading ship in the class of completely new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper quoted military speakers.
The ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but problems after delivery threatened the fate of this ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg sailboats ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen sailors.
As well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures, will have a strong top, a series of air and anti-ship missiles.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible for the latest frigates to be deployed up to two years without returning to the port of birth.
However, constant delays mean that the most modern warships, which were to allow Germany to deploy forces outside its territory, will already be obsolete when they begin to use, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate arrived last year in the newspaper, when German Navy officially refused to release the ship and returned it to the Bohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media have quoted a number of key "software and hardware deficiencies" that would have caused the ship, if it had been deployed in a combat mission, to be useless.
Software deficiencies were of particular importance because the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships will run a crew of 120 sailors - exactly half of the number of people who run the old Bremen fleets.
It also proved that the ship is a significant burden that reduces its impact and limits the Navy’s ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that 7,000 tons of heavy ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice the weight of similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to incorrect hardware, the cost of a complete project, including staff training, is also becoming problematic.
It is said that it has reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), compared to an initial 2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the latest frigates are particularly significant in the light of recent warnings that the maritime power of Germany is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the German Parliamentary Defence Commission, admitted that the Navy actually "is becoming ships that can be deployed."
The officer said that this problem grew over time, because old ships were signed off, and there were no replacement ships.
He complained that none of the baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Fund listens to the secret life of bats
A new study carried out on one property in the hills of Scotland aims to discover how bats use the landscape in search of food.
Results are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and serve as a guide in future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists from the Scottish National Fund will follow the usual bats and the species soprano Pipistrelle, and the brown long bats and bats of the Daubenton species in the Gardens of Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
The recording device will be set to key locations around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also perform mobile research using hand detectors.
The expert analysis of all records will determine the frequency of calls to bats and what they do.
Then a map of the habitats and a report will be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour on the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant in NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of habitat are the most important bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of work on housing management, such as the creation of meadows, and the best way to maintain forest for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and the UK have significantly decreased over the last century.
They are threatened by works of construction and development, which have a negative impact on lay and loss of habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose risks, including sticky paper and chemical processing of building materials, and attacks by domestic cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are much more useful than their eyes when catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location technology to locate bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, who care for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 ha countries across the country, take bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out checks, lay inspections, and sometimes rescue.
The organization even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland on the property of Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which are home to eight of the ten species bats in Scotland.
The manager of David Thompson's property says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Thrave we have a large area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good properties.
But there's so much more unknown about bats, so what we're doing here and in other properties will help us understand better what they need to make progress."
He stresses how important it is to check whether bats are on the property, because it is possible that the accidental destruction of one mother's bed will kill up to 400 women and young people, likely to result in the extinction of the entire local population.
The bats are protected animals and the law prohibits their killing, abuse, harassment or destruction of their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish bat conservation agency, encouraged the public to participate and help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don't know how the population of most of our species is developing."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape while lawyers file a complaint against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo is accused of rape that he has been referred to as "false news," saying people want to "promise" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, who has filed charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of rapeing one American named Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently he paid her $375.000 to keep this incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Addressing his followers, who were 142 million in a video recording on the Instagram Live network, a few hours after the charges report, Ronaldo, 33, criticised the reports, calling them "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," a golden ball winner said in the camera.
"They want to promote using my name.
That's normal.
They want to get to glory by talking about me, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's all right," the player added smiling.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for these claims, which they called "an illegal report on the doubts in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "unmaterial damage in terms of the severity of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino apartment in Las Vegas.
After a night club meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorg reportedly returned to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her, according to documents delivered to Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo kneeled on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99% good guy" who failed those "1%."
The papers say that Ronaldo confirmed that a couple had sexual relations, but that he was willing.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were photographed in the hospital, but that she later agreed to the extrajudicial arrangement because she felt "fear of revenge" and worried that she would "be publicly humiliated."
34-year-old says she's now looking for a cancellation because she's still traumatized by an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester, at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian diva Juve for 100m euros.
Brexit: UK will forever regret losing car manufacturers
The UK will "suffer forever" if it loses world leader's status in car production after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that what Toyota UK said to the BBC - if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement that it will temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on borders in case Bexit remains without an agreement could cause job losses.
The Toyotin Auris and Avensis factory from Burnston produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March we will see stopping production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director General Toyote in Burnston.
Other UK producers, including Hondu, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed fear of how cross-border trade would work if Britain left the EU without an agreement.
BMW, for example, says he'll close his mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main fears relate to what car manufacturers call risks in the supply chain in the Brexit case without agreement.
The production line Toyote operates in principle "just in time", where the parts arrive every 37 minutes from the UK and EU suppliers for cars made by order.
If the UK leaves the EU without the agreement on 29 March, it can break down at the border which can lead to a delay and a lack of parts to industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep supplies longer than one day in her factory in Derbyshire, they said from the company, so that production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said the "Checkers" plan that offers Theresa May for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid those checks at the border".
"We need to have an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will enable me to say, not only to enjoy the present success, but also to take this opportunity," Radio 4 today told the BBC.
"The example not only of Toyote but also of other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been extremely successful in the supply chain."
Toyota could not say how long production would be suspended, but warned that long-term additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory on the market and eventually reduce the number of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and the president of the Union Union Union Union Union, said his members were increasingly concerned: “In my experience, when such jobs are closed, they never come back.
The government spokesperson said: "We need to draw up a precise and convincing plan of our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, they say from the White House.
A very important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "adjourned for another week" because the fight against the candidate for the Judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugha has continued, they said from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the case of Russian involvement in the elections, the relationship between Trump's assistants and Russia, and the potential interference of justice by the president.
Whether Trump's gonna fire the Deputy Attorney General or not, thereby endangering Mr. Mueller's independence, it's been the subject of a speech in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had also spoken about the sound to record talks with Trump and about the possibility of changing the president on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these rumors.
But last Monday he was in the White House, in the middle of a rumor that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "do not like" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid interrupting the hearing of the Senate Judicial Commission on which Kavanaugh and one of the women charged with sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week on Friday, which further postponed the Senate's vote in full.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox News channel Sunday.
Regarding the meeting with Rosenstein, she answered: “The date for this is not yet fixed, it could be this week, and it could be delayed for another week in view of all the other things that are happening in connection with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would reject this claim: Sandersov has not made a brief statement for journalists in the White House since 10 September.
Leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that a smaller number of short speeches were not the result of a "theatrical behaviour" of the journalist's TV, although he said, "I will agree with the fact that they are being exaggerated."
Then she said she'd strengthen direct contact between Trump and the reporters.
"The president holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," said without giving evidence: "We have seen these numbers."
A brief talk will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to directly question the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it as much as possible and you've seen us do it for the past few weeks, and these talks with the president of the United States will change the short talk to reporters."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences during an official visit.
Lonely press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, acting in front of the assembled reporters unscrupulous and occasionally strange.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers employed in the National Health Service (NHS) Scotland about Brexit-related fears
The Health Secretary wrote to EU employees working in Scotland's NHS to express the gratitude of the state and the desire to remain after Brexit.
A member of the Scottish Parliament, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.
The government of Scotland has already committed itself to meeting the costs of solved EU citizens' status requirements working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued over the summer, and decisions are expected this fall.
But the UK government has also speeded up its preparations for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know that for all of you this was a very restless time.
That is why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and wider, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which benefits the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie subjected to an emergency operation after a head injury
The defense team State Tigers Tennessee, Christian Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after he injured his head in Saturday's battle 31:27 from the Vanderbilt Commodores Club, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Master Coach Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the afternoon.
"He came to the field line and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before they put it on the carriers and took it to further questioning.
The Tennessee State official told Chris Harris from the WSMV Nashville channel, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had completed an operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no details of the type/extreme injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury happened.
Abercrombie, a second-year student in red dress, plays the first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five total rounds on Saturday before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 rounds in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher real estate tax in the UK
Buyers from foreign countries will be charged higher rates when buying real estate in the UK, where additional funds will be used to help homeless people according to new conservation plans
This move will neutralize Corby's success in attracting young voters
More taxes will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The vault expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year - to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged higher rates when buying real estate in the UK, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will be published today.
This step will be considered as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn has achieved by trying to attract young voters with promises to ensure more affordable housing care and to focus on those who earn more.
More taxes will be charged to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, thereby strengthening the government's intention to fight against open sleep.
The additional fee, which is in addition to the existing tax, including several levels, introduced two years ago to the second real estate and the purchase for rental, could be up to 3%.
The vault expects this move to increase revenue to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London buy people who do not have a home in the UK, which is why the prices grow, and buyers who buy real estate for the first time tend to become homeowners.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "the cities of spirits" because of a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax reduction to help a larger number of young people come to their first home.
He accused construction companies of holding high real estate prices buying at the first opportunity of a land they do not use, and asked Ms. May to give up the access home allowance in order to end the British "hungry housing policy."
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the control of rentals and the suspension of any of the underlying investments.
He also wants to give councils more authority to build new houses.
Ms. May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to the Prime Minister to return the British dream - that every new generation's life should be better.
And that means repairing our poor housing market.
Britain will always remain open to people who want to live, work and build life in it.
However, it can't be right that individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as companies, can easily buy houses as well as valuable British people.
The dream of ownership over the house has become too far for many people, and inhuman sleep on the open still quite real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross says his "final ambition" is to be the manager of the Scottish representation at a certain time.
Scotland's 40-year-old enjoys the challenge of returning to the life of a club from the northeast, which is currently in third place in the First League, with three points less than the leader.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after last season returned St. Mirren to the Scottish Prime Minister League.
"I wanted to perform for my country as a player.
I was in the B team, and that's what Ross said about the show Sportssound BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and it always dragged me back.
However, such an opportunity would be provided only if I were successful in running the club."
The Russian predecessors like Sanderland's managers include Dick Moyes, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neilla, Roy Keane, Gus Poyeta and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of the Alloa Athletic Club said he didn't feel peace because he came after such great names in such a big club, after he declined the offer of the Barnsley and Ipswich Town clubs.
"The measure of my success at this moment will be 'will I be able to return this club to the prime minister league?'
Judging by the structure and possibilities of this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the Prime Minister's League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get him there, but I think I'll be able to be successful only if I can get the club back to where it belongs."
Ros is only in the third year of his managerial career, after a period that he spent as a chief's assistant in Dambarton and 15 months spent as part of Harts' training staff.
He then helped Allo recover from the fall in the third category, and St. Miren withdrew from the fall of the lower league to the winner of the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably a real intersection," recalled the acquisition of Allo's club.
"I sincerely believed that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I wasn't bad, I made a decent profit, and I enjoyed some solid success.
But playing can be hard.
That's so much you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and work pressure, but management just fits me.
I've always wanted to handle management and now I've been doing it, I haven't felt more comfortable in my entire adult life than I do now."
You can listen to the entire interview at the Sportssound show on Sunday, September 30th on the Scottish Radio from 12:00 to 1 p.m. in British summer time
The perfect time for the glass is Saturday at 17:30, discovers research
The summer wave of heat increased the traffic of British pubs fighting for survival, but increased the pressure on the launch of the restaurant.
In the pubs and bars group, sales grew from 2.7% in July, but the traffic in restaurants decreased by 4.8%, as the figures show.
Peter Martin, from CGA's consulting company, who collected the data, said: "The sustained sunny time and longer than expected participation of England at the World Cup contributed to July following a similar pattern as in the previous month of June, when pubs grew by 2.8%, and restaurants had an even greater fall.
Traffic down in restaurants from 1.8% in June just got worse in July.
The pubs and bars focused on drinks achieved far the best result with greater growth compared to the comparable results of the previous period, rather than the drop in traffic in restaurants.
The pubs focused on food also suffered because of the sun, but not as dramatic as the owners of the restaurant.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars there is an increase in drinking sales by 6.6% for a month, with a fall in food sales by three percent."
Paul Newman, from the Agency for the Analysis of Entertainment Content and Entertainment of the RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have witnessed since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social and sports events are still the main factors when it comes to the sale on the market outside the household.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to fight hard, although sales drop of 4.8% at the annual level will be particularly ill with already existing price pressures.
Long hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food-focused customers, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August would provide a little over the necessary relief."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, amounted to 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow introduction of growth of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, an industrial sales tracking service in the bar, pubs and restaurants sector in the UK, collects and analyzes data on the impact of 47 business groups with a total traffic of over 9 billion pounds and represents an accepted industrial measure.
Every five children have a secret order on social networks that they hide from their parents
Every five children, some of whom have only 11 years of age, have a secret mission on social networks hiding from their parents and teachers, discovering research
A study involving more than 20,000 pupils in higher education revealed an increase in the number of "false Insta" pages
This news has increased the fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of the nanny said she had a "main" command that showed her parents
Every five child, one of whom is only 11 years old, has a real job on social networks he hides from adults.
A study involving 20,000 students in higher education revealed a sudden increase in "false Insta" tasks, referring to the Instagram photo sharing website.
That news reinforced the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of bidders say they have a clean "main" command that shows parents, but they also have private tasks.
One mother who came to the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenage girl who invites others with the words "violate me."
A study carried out by the UK Digital Awareness and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) revealed that 40% of children between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, while half of them admitted to having private tasks.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It upsets the fact that so many teenagers are tempted to create space on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Committee
Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual meeting of that administrative body.
Doyle is the most rewarding Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who lead sports to benefit from her rich experience at international level over the past decade
"Eilid enjoys great respect for the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are sure that athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly from its membership in the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be a sportsman's voice and hope that I can really contribute to sports in Scotland."
An American, who won four Olympic gold totals, including a 200-400-metre race win in 1996 in the Atlantic, and now a regular expert on BBC, remained unmoved after he suffered a transitional ischemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote: “I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said only time can show me if I'm gonna recover and how much.
It was a hard job, but I completely recovered, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging messages."
Advertising for a publisher whose mothers share their views on the Internet
The company that produces traitors shared their views on the Internet advertising that breast-feeds the cow muzaras.
In order to mark the launch of a product described as "the first silent publisher", the consumer technology company Elvie published an ad inspired by a fun music video showing the freedom that new pumps provide to mothers who issue milk.
Four real mothers dance in a barn between shadows and cows with a song whose text reads: "Yes, I am married but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, but that's not true, these are my breasts."
The following refren: "Fump, pump, feed my babies, pump, pump, husband myself."
However, the advertisement published on the Facebook page of the company caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, he saw different reactions from the viewers, while many said he was throwing light on the "horrible" dairy industry.
"The use of cows for advertising this product was a very bad decision.
And they have to get pregnant and give birth to us to produce milk, but their babies are taken away a few days after they were born," someone wrote.

Another commented: “It is clear that it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use it to advertise a traitor to mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "Advertising without any sense."
Others stood in the defense of the commercials, and one woman admitted that her song was "urnegrily."
"I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy this if I still felt it.
Because of the betrayal, I felt just like a cow.
Advertising's a little silly, but I figured it out right.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another commented: “This is a funny commercial aimed at mothers who issue milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like "requirements".
This isn't a advertising that praises or attracts the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovers that they all danced with discreet pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of advertising is based on the knowledge that many mothers who betray milk say they feel like cows.
However, the pump Elvie is completely insensitive, there is no wire or tube and stands in the breast of the breast, giving women the freedom to move, holding their babies, and even going out to deliver the milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother, commented: "The pump Elvie is so revolutionary a product that it deserves a decent and provocative launch.
By withdrawing the parallel between the honeycomb and the cow, we wanted to focus on the issue of milk and all the challenges that come with it, showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new pump provides.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has reached the headlines.
During the Seven Fashions in London, the mother of two children appeared on the track in the creation of Marte Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children held by migrants has increased, although the number of monthly crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult to find caregivers for children.
Traditionally, most of the elderly and themselves have been migrants without documents that are afraid of endangering their country's ability to remain by stepping up to accept a child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household would have to give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration services.
Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Service, said last week before Congress that this service arrested dozens of people who applied for custody of minors without escorting.
The service later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had not been convicted.
"Approximately 80% of the persons who are either caregivers or members of the household of the caregivers are illegal in this country, and a good part of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
That's why we're going to continue looking for those people, Mr. Albence said.
In order to ensure that children pass through the procedure faster, officials have introduced new rules to which some of them will have to appear before the court within a month of detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, said workers at the reception.
Many will come forward with a video call instead of personal, to ask the immigration judge to legalize his status.
Those who are determined not to meet the conditions will be deported quickly.
The longer children remain closed, the greater the prospect of becoming anxious or depressed, which can lead to an outbreak of anger or attempts to escape, the workers of receptions and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say such risks are increased in larger institutions such as those in the town of Tornillo, where it is much easier to predict signs indicating that the child has problems.
They added that moving children to a tent town without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to greet friends can cause a trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria seeks urgent withdrawal of US, French and Turkish "occupational forces"
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem also called on Syrian refugees to return, although the war in that country has lasted for eight years.
Moulem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that the forces were illegally in the Syrian country, saying the fight against terrorism and "will be counted accordingly."
They have to withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said at the meeting.
Moualem insisted that Syria's "war on terrorism is almost over", where over 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "the holy fight until we exploit all Syrian terrorists", including terrorist groups and "every foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly responsible for training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this country with a broken war.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said there are good conditions for their return and he accused "some Western countries" of "widening irrational fears" that encourage refugees not to return.
"We have invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to enable these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for the reconstruction of Syria until Assad and the opposition reach agreement on the end of the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on establishing a buffer zone in the last major rebel rebellion in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement rejected a major attack by the Syrian forces supporting Russia in the province in which three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that a military action against jihadist and combatants from the Nusra front would be launched, linked to Al-Qaida, who would "be exhausted".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon convene the first meetings of the new committee, consisting of the authorities and members of the opposition, to draft a post-election constitution for Syria and prepare a path to the elections.
Moualem issued the terms of the Government of Syria for participation in the committee's work, saying that the work of that body should be limited to "the consideration of members of the current constitution" and warned of the possibility of external interference.
Why Trump will be selected for second term
According to that logic, Trump would be re-elected in the 2020 elections unless, for what many liberal observers are likely to hope, the objection and scandal did not earlier interrupt his mandate.
This would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic end of the presidential mandate of all time!"
So far, there's no sign of the viewer's fatigue.
Since 2014, the hit-and-run rating has doubled by more than 1.05 million on the CNN channel and nearly tripled by 1.6 million on the MSNBC channel.
According to the Nielsen agency, channel Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the hit period, unlike four years ago when it had 1.7 million, and the show Rachel Maddow Show of the MSNBC channel exceeded the rating of cable channels with 3.5 million viewers during the evening with hit news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand," said Neal Baer's producer of the "Elected Survivors" drama on the ABC channel, about the government secretary who becomes the president after the attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a longtime comedy writer and author of the book "Only funny parts: and a few of the harsh truths about entering the Hollywood boys club", has a different theory.
She remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
She asked.
"He said, 'Because he's laughing at me,' said Mrs. Scovell.
Chaos has fun value, too.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of the law on abortion from Roe's proceedings against Wade, whether immigrant families will be able to connect and what will be the state of global attraction.
Exclusion is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged viewers.
And yet, you went a little further than general information when you realized that you were watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward used the sources of "deep background" for his book "Stras," about the jacket Paul Manafort of New Skin worth $15,000 (“Department with a bold character of babacity”, wrote Washington Post) and the implications of picturesque descriptions, this, anatomy, Mr. Trump giving Storm Daniels.
I, for example, will never see Super Maria with the same eyes again.
"Part of what he makes you experience as a reality show is that I feed you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the Zalagaonica show, commenting on the rotation of the acting position and the daily complications of Trump's show (criticizing the American football league, praise Kim Jong-un).
You can't let yourself miss an episode, otherwise you're behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Fless this week, in front of his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauaija, it was sunny at about 80 degrees (27°C), but he closed himself inside and watched MSNBC and recorded CNN at the same time.
He could not be separated from the screen, not until Brett Kavanaugh was prepared to face the Senate Judicial Commission and his future in the Supreme Court was uncertain.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows in the past, and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Big cash flow from the side of the most uncertain mid-term election race for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that 17th-century Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the redistribution of congressional districts that resulted in two candidates in the race for the same place.
The recent border crossing of the district in Pittsburgh pre-city led to the election of Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who came to the head of the other county after the extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb is fighting against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th county of Pennsylvania, which is largely intertwined with the new 17th district.
The cards were redesigned after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January decided that the old circuits were continuously formed for the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district launched a campaign to finance the campaign between the main party fund collectors, the Committee collecting funds for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after his victory in a wide - eyed special election for the 18th Pennsylvania Congression in March.
This position has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won a 20-point prejudice.
Political analysts have given little priority to democracies.
The United States considers the punishment of El Salvador because of China's support, but then withdraws
Diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little encouragement from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump team's management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, a spokesman of the Department, in a statement in the beginning of the month.
However, the penalties were considered only for El Salvador, which was estimated to have received US$ 140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial assistance and targeted critical restrictions, would hardly hit this Central American country with a high level of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings have progressed, North American and Central American officials have postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, which should have been the continuation of a similar last year's package, which was a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
By mid-September, however, the senior government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and thus actually interrupted any review of the sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance that the administration attachs to the meeting, the diplomats said.
And three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new heavy messages or sentences from Washington.
Speaker of the White House, on behalf of Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal debates on the condition that they remain anonymous.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst near the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next he prepares could be a report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on the possible injustice of Trump's judiciary, which now contains significant evidence in public records.
According to reports, Mr. Mueller also directed his investigation to discover a possible link between Trump's campaign and Russia's election attack.
If the majority changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he's prepared to go back to the electorate, and maybe even before the jury.
There is a lot of these "if" and I don't want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall, not those in Europe that are similar, inevitable.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938 the German soldiers were ready to execute a state strike against Hitler, only to the West oppose and support the Czechoslovakian in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the casualties that followed.
The course of history revolves around such breakthroughs, and the unmistakable march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
The Americans are now faced with more of these crossing points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires a deputy prosecutor, Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in an immediate position ever since this letter last year reported that he proposed a secret recording of the president and suggested that he was not similar to performing the function.
Mr. Rosenstein says the statement from the Times is incorrect.
"How will we react if a recently ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his candidacy for the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the mid-term elections for the Congress that Mr. Trump will call for responsibility?
If we fall into these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I believe we're not going to fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who deported to Auschwitz the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country in which I was an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, sent me to burn candles for the Sabbath on that table with a cuckoo cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapida from Vienna
The Rangers are on Thursday host Rapida from Vienna, knowing that they will win over the Austrians, after an impressive rhyme in Spain against Villarrela at the beginning of this month, to put themselves in a good position to qualify from the Group of the European League.
The knee injury prevented the associate player Graham Dorrans from debiting this season until the unsolved match with the 2-2 final score, but he is convinced that Rangers can use that result as a jumpboard for further.
"It was a valuable point for us because Villareal was a good opponent," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went into the game believing that we could achieve something and went with a point.
Maybe we could finally take them, but all in all, the unsolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, and we got back in the second, and we were better.
We are again expected to have a great European evening on Thursday.
We hope we can take three points, but it will be a tough match because they had a good result in the last game, though, with the support of the audience we can certainly push out and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard, starting from everything that happened to my injuries, until the change in the club itself, but now we're satisfied with what we have right now.
The team is in good shape and the guys really enjoy it; we practice well.
I hope we can continue now, leave the past season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep out of worry about pension savings
Despite the fact that the students had a clear idea of how they would want to care for them, a few of them talked about it with members of their families.
About half of the people involved in nationwide's research said they talked to their husbands about long-term care costs.
Only 10% of them said they talked to their children about it.
"People want someone from the family to be old about them, but they don't want to start talking about it," says Holly Snyder, vice-president of the sector for life insurance in the Nationwide company.
Here's where it starts.
Speak with your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide for you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family and consider where and how to give it to you, because such decisions can be a significant factor in determining the price.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term funding choices may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value that would help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your own savings – provided you have enough money.
Manage your legal documents: Prevent legal battles at the root.
Make authorization to make medical assistance decisions so that you have a trusted person who will monitor the medical care provided to you and ensure that health workers act in accordance with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the conclusion of a power agreement for finance.
This means choosing a person of trust who will make financial decisions on your behalf and take care of paying your bills if you remain weak.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation where he needs emergency medical attention and is being taken to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Enter the details in the written plan to be ready.
"It's not just about the finances, it's also about who the doctors are?" asked Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Plan it."
A man shot with several shots from an Ilfracombe air rifle
One man was shot with several shots from the air rifle as the pedestrians returned home from the evening out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 according to British summer time, as "a random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died from a severe earthquake and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian city of Paul on Friday, officials reported, and the number of dead is expected to grow.
As a result, relief officials could not obtain any information from the province of Dongale, a region north of Palu, which is close to an epicenter of 7.5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some of the key facts about Palu and Donghal, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesia, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
It reached the county extending over 300 km (180 miles) on the north coast of the island of Sulawesia.
The county, which is administratively lower in rank than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture forms the basis of the nature of the province of Central Sulawesi, particularly the coastal region of Dongal.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but mainly concentrated in Morowoli, on the opposite coast of Sulawesia.
Paul and Dongala have been hit by tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongal.
Cunami also hit the west of Dongal in 1996 when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the Sumatre coast.
2006: The earthquake of 6,8 degrees struck south Java, the most populated Indonesian island, by triggering tsunamis that ravaged the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The 7.6-degree earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 degree earthquake struck one of Mentawai Island, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters that destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because it reminded people of the deadly destruction of earthquakes and tsunamis from 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the collapse of the building.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, with more than 500 people lost their lives, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists remained temporarily trapped.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla City, Alaska, was arrested on the basis of suspicion that he committed violence in the family, prevented the reporting of violence in the family and opposed arrest, a report published by the Alaska State Police Agency on Saturday said.
According to the police report, when the acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin was detained in Mat-Su's detention unit, and he was charged with a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday where he explained that "surely not guilty," the network said.
Palin is faced with three Class A violations, which means he's threatened with a prison sentence up to a year and a 250,000-dollar fine.
He is also accused of a Class B violation, which is punishable by a prison sentence for one day and a fine of $2,000.
This isn't the first time that Palina's criminal records have been filed.
In December 2017, he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin, invited the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Court of Justice of the Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of family violence, of disturbing the reporting of violence in the family and of possession of weapons in an alcoholized state associated with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Saru Palin criticised the veteran groups in 2016 after bringing his son's violent behaviour to the PTSP after his service in Iraq.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Earthquakes of 7.5 degrees that caused tsunamis destroyed hundreds of homes.
There has been a break in the connection and supply of electricity, and the number of dead is expected to increase in the next few days.
The epicenter of the earthquake was directly along the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of the capital city of Indonesia, Jakarte.
On social networks, video recordings show a moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palo when the tsunami flooded the coast.
Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for a terrorist attack suspect in New York.
Federal Prosecutors in New York are seeking a death sentence for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York where eight people died -- a rare sentence that has not been carried out for federal crime in the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used the rented truck Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle track along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, where he selected pedestrians and bikers who were on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intendedly" killed eight victims and "intended" caused serious bodily injury, a request for the execution of the death penalty, which was filed in the South New York District.
According to both of these points, it is possible to impose a death penalty, as stated in the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Supreme Court accused Saipova of 22 counts of charges involving eight counts of murder and recruitment, which federal prosecutors usually use in cases of organised crime, and charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "significant planning and preconceived," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "ugly, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enriquea Angelinija, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Drakea, Ariel Erli, Hernana Ferruchi, Hernana Diego Mendoze and Alejandro Damiana Pagnucca", the request for execution was made.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South New York District last had a case where a death penalty was threatened.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death sentence in a New York federal case was executed in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were sentenced to death after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed on June 19, 1953 in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not show repentance in days and months after the attack.
He told the investigators he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone he was inspired to execute the attack, it was reported in the indictment.
He also asked to highlight the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
It turns out he's not guilty of 22 counts of charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were clearly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty, instead of accepting life imprisonment without the possibility of freeing the guilty, will only prolong the trauma of those events for all involved," Patton said.
Saip's defense had previously asked the prosecution not to utter a death sentence.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for talks about Brexit
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the national army" during a protest at the conservative conference.
Former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "sympathize with the dissatisfaction" of Eurosceptics, since one of the Members of Theresa May suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative representative Peter Bone said at a meeting in Birmingham that until now the UK would "be gone" that Mr. Farage was secretary to Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May in trying to unite her deep-separate ranks stressed the conservatives who advocate the EU's stay and joined a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan from Chequers despite attacks and attacks by the supporters and opponents of Brexit and the EU.
The allies insisted that she continue with attempts to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite negative reactions, and forced Eurosceptics and labs to choose between its package and "haosa".
Mr. Bone said at the meeting Go away means going to Solihull that he wants to "reject Chequers".
He proposed that Mr Farage should be given the title and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were the chief, we'd be out by now," he said.
An envoy from Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must expel Chequers."
Explaining its opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to bring our laws into our country."
Mr. Bone has rejected the statement that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed the opinion and that they want to remain is completely incorrect."
Brexitist Andrea Jenkyns, who also attended the meeting, told reporters: “I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the public, the opposition won't vote for it, it's not popular in our stranger and among our activists who were actually those who went out on the streets and chose us.
"Please discard the plan from the Chequers and start listening."
In a strong message, Mrs. May added: "The prime ministers succeed in keeping their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage told the gathered that politicians should make themselves "sigh dissatisfaction" if they were to fail the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to play Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that's not going to happen to you."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the edge of Brexit’s edition, to feel discontent.
"We mobilize the national army of this country that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not calm down until we become independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, survivors marched through Birmingham before holding a two-way assembly in the city center.
Several activists waved the "Torists Against Brexit" transparent after forming a group this weekend.
Laborist Lord Adonis complained to the conservatives about the security problems they had with the party's application at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Plus plan, for the unmistakable state of the borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farce.
Good Brexit is not possible," he added.
Warren's planning to seriously consider a candidate for the president.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would seriously consider candidacy for the president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts woman spoke about her future during a meeting in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, the honorary critic of President Donald Trump, again candidates for the November election against a Republican representative at the Geoff Diehl House of Representatives, who was co-chairing Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.

One of those present asked if she was planning to run for the president.
Warren has denied how it is time for women to go to Washington to repair our corrupt government, which includes a woman on the head."
Arrested after LSU Sims was shot.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday the arrest of a shooting suspect who was killed by LSU Wade Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police station announced the arrest of Ditheon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 at the press conference.
A video of the shooting was published on Friday, seeking help in finding a man who can be seen on the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
Wade Sims was shot in the head as a result of what he passed away," Murphy J. Paul, police chief, told the media on Saturday, according to 247Sports.

Russian Gran Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the order ensures him victory over Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team's order would play a major role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the beginning and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two circles and calling on Vettel to attack his team member.
Vettel first went into the box and left Hamilton behind to engage in traffic at the beginning, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the box one round later and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after the action point from the point which caused the Ferrari driver to leave the free interior with the risk of delay after a double move in defence of the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the last row of grids and was the seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race, relying on his tires to reach the swift end and ran over Kimie Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally got into a box in the 44th round, but failed to speed up the pace in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen took fourth place.
The day was hard because Valtteri had been doing a fantastic job all weekend and he was the real gentleman that let me through.
Team did a really great job to achieve one-two formation finish," Hamilton said.
That was a very bad body speech.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinsten at a meeting on Saturday because of her insistence that she did not release Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh accused of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are evil, poor and lying.
The only thing that could have happened and the wonderful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and angry and pitiful and lying, he said.
When you look at the releases and the information that's leaked into the public, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it."
I didn't do it."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leave information to the public?
You remember her answer. Did you leave the document to the public? What?
Oh, no.
I didn't let the public go."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we let... no, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Ford sent Feinstein a letter in July with details on Ford's instructions against Kavanaugh, and it leaked in early September - however Feinsten demented that the information was leaked from her office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't let her story in the public," she told Feinstein's board, reports Hill.
She asked me to keep it in secret, and I kept it in secret, as she asked."
But her denial did not come to the approval of the president, who at the meeting on Saturday night commented: To tell you, it was really a bad speech by the body.
Maybe it's not, but I've never seen a worse body speech in my life."
Continuing his defense against the Supreme Court candidate, accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president suggested that the Democrats use these claims for their own purposes.
They are determined to restore power at all costs.
You see the evil, the shame, they don't care who's going to hurt, who have to run too far to get to power and control," the Mediaite conveys the words of the president.

The air traffic controller lost his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on the plane escaped an earthquake.
The air traffic controller in Indonesia declared by a hero after he died by ensuring safe flight of more than a hundred people.
More than 800 people died, and many are watering themselves as missing after a strong earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, starting the tsunami.
Strong subsequent earthquakes continue to hit this area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled trying to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his workplace in the control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Pala airport, which swooped heavily.
He remained to ensure safe flight of the Batika Air Flight 6321, which was standing on the runway at the time.
When he realized that the control tower was coming down, he jumped out of it.
He passed away later in the hospital.
Portparol Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said his decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
Our hearts are broken because of this news," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the number of victims could reach thousands, while the State Agency for Disaster Relief indicates that access to the cities of Dongal, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
It is believed that the number of victims is still growing, since many bodies are still below the ruins, and many cannot reach," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho's spokesman said.
The waves that reached a height of up to six meters devastated Paul, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: She drove emergency aid every minute to import bodies.
The government's lack of clean water.
Small stores are being robbed all over the place."
Jean Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to the CNN: The Red Cross of Indonesia is working very hard to provide assistance to survivors, but we don't know what they're going to get there."
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesia's President Yoko Widodo arrived in Pal on Sunday and ordered the army of that country: Of all, I ask you to work all day long to carry out all the tasks relating to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Indonesia struck an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
The fall of a plane in Micronesia: Air Niugini announces that after the fall of a plane in the lagoon, one face is turned missing.
The airline whose aircraft crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia reported that one face was being treated as missing, after it had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the plane that had tones.
Air Niugini in the statement says that since Saturday afternoon they are not able to trace the passenger.
The airline reports that in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and investigators, they are working on finding that man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his time or nationality.
Local vessels helped rescue other passengers and crew members after the plane fell into the water trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials announced Friday that seven faces were transferred to the hospital.
The airline reported that six more passengers were detained in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone was in stable condition.
It's still unclear what caused the fall and what was the exact result of the event.
And the airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane ended up in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some eyewitnesses think the plane flew over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and the others were able to break through to the exit for a case of danger through the water that cut them to the line in the plane that was tones.
He said that the crew was panicking and screaming, and that he had suffered a head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that mariners working nearby at the port repair site also helped rescue the boat on a dive that the passengers moved to the shore before the plane sank at about 30 metres (100 feet).
Air Safety Network data indicate that in the accidents recorded in PNG over the past two decades, 111 people have been lost, but none of them have participated in Air Niugini.
The analyst reconstructs the event on the night the woman was burned alive.
The prosecution ended the case on Saturday in a repeated proceedings against a man accused of burning a living woman in Mississippi in 2014.
US Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
Before the jury, he said he used cell phone data to draw a picture of the movement of the accused Quinton Tellis, aged 29, and the victims of Jessica Chambers, aged 19, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he got location data from several phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which is contrary to his earlier claims, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same place as Chambersin at the time when he was, according to his own claims, with a friend Michael Sanford, the police went to examine Sanford.
Sanford testifying on Saturday said he wasn't in town that day.
On the question of whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanfred said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that Chambers met about two weeks before her death.
Mobile data indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett was that Tellis set a time after Chambers' death from his phone deleted her messages, calls and contact information.
He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense should begin on Sunday with the final words.
The judge said he expected the trial before the jury to follow later in the course of the day.
The High Breed: What's a enlightened hip-hop?
Hip-hop wants to challenge the negative attitude towards that genre by filling his compositions with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that the hip-hop has distanced itself from its beginnings when dealing with political messages and social issues.
They want to return to their roots and return popularity to the enlightened hip-hop.
Artists like the Fugees and Commons are gaining popularity again in Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
The New York babysitter sues a couple for resignation after a racist text message.
The New York Nanny sues a couple for dismissal on the basis of discrimination after she has received a text message from the mother in which she complains that she is another black person."
Couples deny that they are racists, judging the charges as extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed dissatisfaction with her arrival on the first working day of 2016 when she realized that she was a new mother of children, Giselle Maurice, a black woman.
There's not one more black woman," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending her to her wife, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
When she became aware of her gaffe, Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that their ex-baby, who was an African-American, was already doing her job badly and that instead of her, she was expecting a Filipino, she passed the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice has received a fee for one day's work and a bribe sent home.
Maurice now sues a couple for compensation for dismissal, as well as a $350 fee per day for six months, as much as she was originally hired to live with her family, even without a contract.
I want to show them, you see, you can't do such things," she said to Post on Friday, adding that it's discrimination."
The couple returned to the charges of racism that the cancellation of Mauritian's engagement was reasonable because they feared that after they offended her, they would not be able to believe it.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," Joel Plasco said for the Post's husband.
But would you trust your children who you have offended, even if they have done so with a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Qualifying the complaint as an extortion," Plasco said that his wife had only received two months of maternity leave and that she was in a very difficult situation."
You're going after someone like that?
That's not nice," the investment bank added.
Although the trial is still under way, the court of the public was quick in condemning couples on social networks, criticizing them for such behavior and thinking.
Paddington's publishers were afraid that readers would not share with the bear who spoke, a new letter revealed.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says about the letter: It's hard to put in the position of someone who reads it for the first time before the publication.
It's very interesting to know what we know now about Paddington's success."
Saying that her father, who, before the little drunk bear inspired him to write a book for children, worked for BBC as a cameraman, was still positive if his work was rejected, added that the 60th edition of the book was filled with happiness and sorrow after his death last year.
She added that her father was secretly proud of Paddington, whom she described as a very important member of our family."
He was these men, he didn't like to be praised," she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if your child had achieved something and you were proud of him, even though it wasn't your duty.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success in a way like that.
Although he was the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed all the credit to Paddington alone."
My daughter was dying, and we had to forgive ourselves over the phone.
Her daughter was suddenly transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
Nad regularly called to say that it was bad, and that they didn't expect to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
Then Nad called me to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to forgive her.
I did it, too.
I said, Tashi, I love you, honey.
I'll be with you soon, too.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping blood slowly stopped working and no longer flowed through her blood flow.
She died just a few moments before that, and everything's turned off.
I could just sit and wait, knowing what was next.
I couldn't scream, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be gathered."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who was now in mourning for the death of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers, who had not even dreamed of the pain she was going through.
No one knew," she said.
I've got my head down, and my tears are running down my face without stopping.
It's hard to explain, but during the summer, I was overwhelmed by my compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women leave messages to prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide want to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humpreyes on the big bridge put up cards with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression to commit suicide from 18 years of age.
I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis (45), who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a prospective cook with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They've always said that his smile would watch every room."
But before he died, he left his job because he was in a very dark phase."
Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide in 2014.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm always worried that it'll leave any consequences."
Mrs. Davis invented those cards so that people would know that there's someone you can talk to and who you can talk to, so even if it was just a friend.
Don't sit down and shut up - talk to me."
Mrs. Humphreys, Mrs. Davis' long friend, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
He didn't say he was indisposed, depressed, or anything else," she says.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He was on the bottom of Christmas - when the children opened their presents he didn't look them in the eye or anything else."
She says that his death was a huge trauma to them, but that they have to overcome it: it leaves a huge void in the family.
That'll tear us apart.
But we will continue and fight."

With the opening of an FBI investigation, the future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain.
I thought that if we really managed to get something out of what he was looking for -- a limited length and scope investigation -- maybe it would bring us together a little," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee would break down because of unresolved party views.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Their discontent is caused by the choice of the moment.
Elections for Congress are held for only five weeks, November 6, and if Republicans pass badly, as expected, their attempts to have their man selected in the highest court in the country will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush called the senators on Saturday, lobbying for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes his report?
He will vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavnaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to decide by his vote and confirm his appointment as Supreme Court.
The number of escapes from North Korea falls under Kim.
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Calling for information from the Ministry of the Unity of South Korea, Park Byeong-seug stated that last year 1127 ran as compared to 2011 when that number was 2706.
Mr. Park said that two decisive factors were stronger border control between North Korea and China and higher tariffs charged by smugglers.
Pyongyang didn't make a public statement.
A large majority of refugees from the north will eventually be offered citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Korean citizens have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with South Korea and is easier to cross than a solidly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between two Koreas.
China is considered illegal migrants, not refugees, and often returns them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have been considerably improved in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of two countries met in Pyongyang primarily to discuss the ongoing negotiations on denuclearization.
This was followed by a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, on which broad consensus was reached that they would work on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for a lack of progress.
Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no point in our first unilateral disarmament," the RI said in his address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bretta Kavanaugha a hysterical," saying he was unfit for service in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugha hysterical" and said he was unfit for service in the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if she ever acted like that, she would be called hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening presentation, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost yelling and hugging when he was talking about his family and his high school years,
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, evaluating the allegations against him with a grotesque and orchestrated attack on his personality" that organised liberals to anger that Hilary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not perform a function in the Supreme Court because it showed his keen interest in harming the Democrats.
I believe that he disqualifies himself with such statements and with the way he went against Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
On the question of whether he will try to revoke the Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi is dead.
I'll tell you next - if he doesn't tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he's not just like being in the Supreme Court, but not in the court he's in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanugh is currently a judge of District District Court of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about any Kavanaughi rulings against the Act on Access to Health Protection or in Roe's case against Wade, since he was considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether to change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not time for a hysterical, biased person to be put in court and we are expected to say that is not wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
Reasonable anger, anger that has accumulated for months and years, and it cannot be resolved without pay.
We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steine told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, what do you say?"
She continued: She helped me a lot when she was an executive director, and she said that she also cried when she was angry, but that she developed a technique that made her feel that when she got angry and started to cry, the person she was talking to said that you might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then I'd just keep going.
And I thought she was great."
The tears are allowed a way to get rid of anger in part and because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories from my earlier job, in the office where most men were, is how I was once crying for the indescribable anger, an older woman - the cold boss I always had a little scared - grabbed my neck and pulled it out to the stairs.
I never let them see me cry," she told me.
They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad, so they're gonna be happy because they think they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
When in 1987, Hart was caught in an out-of-court affair on the Monaco Business ship and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, discovered that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for the president himself.
That wasn't exactly a well-thought decision," she told me through the laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it Snow and seven ducks."
Since the campaign had already slowed down, she was lagging behind with the fund-raising, so she said she wouldn't be in the race if she didn't collect $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave her $1,000 would give her just 250.
Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions -- gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration for the system that made it difficult to collect funds and target voters instead of their representatives, and anger for the shovinism - from which she got into her throat.
You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Schroeder how the press reacted to her.
You'd think Kleinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they're gonna put on my memoir?
"She cried?"
How a trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The first commercial war cannons between the United States and China were deafening, and until the end of the battle is seen, the gap between the countries can be of long-term benefit to Beijing, hard experts.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, first issued a warning early this year by taxing key Chinese export articles including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest hit occurred this week with new tariffs that hit items worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), which are practically reclaimed by half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has returned the same measure every time, and the latest is the introduction of tariffs from five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has been promised that the United States will respond to the same measure, and the second largest world economy seems not to stop soon.
To force Washington to withdraw means to satisfy the demands, but public worship to the U.S. would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, Chinese president.
However, experts claim that, if Beijing plays its next move well, U.S. forces in the trade war can sustain China's long-term positive efforts to reduce the interdependence of two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the start of a severe natural fall in one of these two countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a researcher whose focus is on Asia in the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is ready" to return refugees, Foreign Minister said.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for assistance in the reconstruction of a country that has been damaged by war for over seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
Today, the situation on the ground is much more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas that have destroyed terrorists in order to restore normal life.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were directed towards their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the damaged country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or help from the rebel countries.
Europe took the victory to the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National van Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe restored the crown while Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team won 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was tortured throughout the tournament, threw the ball into the water at the 16th hole pair 3, leaving the French Molinary sword.
The Italian golfer Molinari has been brilliant in all rounds, and has become one of four players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since the 1997 tournament started in this format.
American Jordan Speith lost 5-4 of Throjorn Olesen from Denmark, the lowest ranking player of the European team.
The world's best-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 of Ian Poulter from England who might have been the last Ryder Cup.
Veteran with eight Ryder purchases, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the best European tournament winner ever with 25.5 points in career.
I don't usually cry, but I couldn't hold it today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy, I'm very happy that we won the cup again.
Here's an important team and I'm glad I could be of help," emotional Garcia said after the European victory.
He's handing over to his countryman John Rama who won the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods 2 to 1 in a single match on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to win Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this man," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 career record at Ryder's Cup.
Extraordinary statistics for one of the best players of all time who won 14 biggest titles and is only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team was struggling to find a way to the hole all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top golf during the entire tournament.
After the disappointing performance of his team, US captain Jim Fury said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we gave resistance to Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking Thomas' hat off.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We're going to regroup, work with PGA America and our board, Ryder, and we're going ahead.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to admit who's better.
We're on top."
