Valiant additional deputies are concerned that they look like Marines.
Some Members do not understand why their status should be changed to "Member of Wells' Parliament".
The MPs were upset about the plans to change the name of the local east to the name "Parliament Wells."
Deputies of all political views suggest that it's a disgrace.
One of the labyrinth MPs said his colleagues were worried that it was rhyming with the words "stupid" and "stupid."
For readers outside Wells: In the Welsh language, twp means "stupid", and pwp means "stupid".
The deputy said that her group was not completely satisfied and suggested alternatives.
The Valiant conservators said their group was ready to discuss the change in the name of the East, but noted that it was a brief verbal transition from a member of the Valiant parliament to a "marinet."
In this context, the waly letter in w speaks the same thing as the Yorkshire English letter u.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is now developing a draft law on the amendment of the name, made a statement: "The final decision on any description of what the Members of the march are calling will, of course, be the issue of the members themselves."
The Wells government law since 2017 gives the Valiant East the right to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a national consultation on proposals that found broad support to call the East of Wales.
With regard to the title of an additional deputy, the Commission has given the Members of Parliament Wells or the CPU the opportunity, but the CPU version has received the greatest support during public consultations.
The additional MPs obviously propose alternatives, but the way to reach consensus can be the main pain for seniority, Elin Jones, which is supposed to present a bill on changes over the course of a few weeks.
Other changes will also be included in the work of the Assembly, such as the rules on disqualification of additional Deputies and changes in committee structure.
The additional Members shall vote in final terms on what they should be called when they are doing their preliminary work.
Macedonians vote on a reference for changing country names
On Sunday, voters are calling for a change in their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" or against it.
National voting was organized to resolve a multiannual issue with neighbouring Greece, which has its own area called Macedonia.
In Athens long insisted that their neighbor's name is a claim on their territory that prevented Macedonia from joining the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
Macedonian President Georgie Ivanov, a referee on the change of name, said he would not take part in the vote.
But the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, claim that the change of name is just the cost of joining the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
Named temple of St. Martin's silence, churches in Harlem fight for existence
"Before, as the old people I spoke to had said, there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"There's neither one nor the other here today."
He said that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People have different attitudes and feelings at present," he said.
"The bar is no longer a pleasant local guest room where people walk constantly."
As for the churches, he was concerned that the money from the sale had been acting for as long a period as the leaders expected, and sooner or later they would return to where they had started.
Churches, he added, can be replaced by living women with kandaminiums, filled with people who will not help the temple that will remain in the area.
"The vast majority of residents who buy candinaments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore it will accelerate the day when these churches close together, because it is unlikely that the majority of people who move to these candinaments will be adopted by these churches."
Both churches were built by a group of whites before Garlem became a black area – the Church of St. Martin in 1870, the Church of St. Martin in ten years.
The first white Methodist press left in the 1930s.
The black crowd, who was praying nearby, got the property to the building.
The Church of St. Martin was seized by a black-skin community under the leadership of John Howard Johnson, who appointed a bunch of traders on the main trade in Harlem 125th Street, where they refused to hire or hire black-skinners.
The fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but the veterans under the direction of Father Johnson planned a reconstruction: they put the corals into operation.
Similar to David Johnson, father Johnson's son, and any successor to St. Martin's Church, he proudly called a corione "the poor people".
The expert who played in the Carolina in July called it "Cultural Treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
An expert at Tiffany Ng from Michigan University also noted that it was the first coral in the world to be played by black-sucked musician Dionysius A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to a large coral in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriveser said that the Church of Saint Martin had not replaced it.
What happened in St. Martin's Church in the last few months was a complex story between architects and counselors, some of whom were attracted by false church leaders, others by eparthia.
The direction of the believers -- the governing body of income, consisting of the chaplain's assistants -- wrote in an eparchy in July with a caution that the eparchy "trys to translate expenditure" towards the eparity of the believers, although the eparchy did not participate in the recruitment of architects and advisors sent by eparchy.
Some arrivals complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the parish.
The shark wounded a 13-year-old boy during a dawg hunt in California.
On Saturday, the shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy who was hunting on the cattle market in California on the day of the opening of the hunting season.
The attack took place about 7 o'clock in the morning near the Bacon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hemel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he was dealing with dawing with his friends for half an hour when he heard a boy screaming for help, and then swam with the others to help get him out of the water.
At first Hemel thought it was a mere excitement from hunting the Lobsters, but then he "understanded what had happened something bad: "I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
"All his key was broken," said Hemel, adding that he noticed it when he went to the boy.
I cried out to everyone out of the water, "In the water near the shark!" he added.
The boy was transported by air to the baby's hospital Reidy in San Diego, where he was in critical condition.
The variety of sharks that have been attacked is unknown.
Captain Lara Giles' savior reported on the media briefing that the shark had been observed in this place a few weeks earlier, but was determined that it was a safe diversion.
Jails added that the suffering had been damaged by the upper part of the table.
Soldiers closed their way to the beach from Ponta-Bich in Casablanca to Swami in Escinitas for 48 hours to conduct research and security.
Jails noted that in this area more than 135 species of sharks live, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans to move to the British beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to work with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening up beauty warehouses in universities where trained specialists will work.
As a result of a significant increase in the British beauty market with a discount of 2.8 billion pounds of sterlings that continue to grow, while the volume of sales of fashion clothes and household goods decreases, more huge beauty houses will be represented in 11 salons throughout the country and also in other new salons next year, which demonstrate success.
Investment in beauty comes because supermarkets are looking for a way to fill a place on police stations that used to be used by televisions, microwaves, and household stores.
Sainsbury's said to double the amount of beauty goods, offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which appear first.
An existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in firm departments like what can be found in stores like Boots.
Huge stores also restart their cosmetics shop, so most products will fit for giants, and this trend becomes becoming the most demanding of young buyers.
Besides, Fragrance Shop perfume shop will test a concession in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which was opened last week in Croydan in southern London, and the second opens in Selie-Ouk (Birmingge) at the end of this year.
Buying online and going to buy small quantities of products every day in local stores around the house will lead to more efforts being made by the supermarket to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Cupe, director of Sainsbury's, said the trade points would be more and more similar to the universe, because a network of supermarkets is trying to compete with Aldi's dissidents, Lidl with the help of more services and non-cash goods.
Sainsbury's placed Argo's trading points in hundreds of stores, and also placed several Habitats points from the time that two years ago acquired both networks, which, in his words, supported the growth of the sale of food and made the acquisition more profitable.
The previous attempt by supermarkets to rebuild their beauty departments and monkeys has not ended successfully.
Sainsbury's was a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the attempt to share revenue from the pharmacies ended after a number of divorces in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after three years ago, Sainsbury's sold its octopus business together with 281 Celesio stores owned by Lloyds Pharmacy for 125 million pounds of sterling.
It was reported that Lloyds played his role in this plan, extending the range of delicious branding to care for the skin, including the number La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hex, commercial director Sainsbury's, said, "We have changed the appearance of our beauty salons to improve the conditions for our customers.
We also invested in teaching our colleagues to offer their recommendations.
Our brand range is designed to meet any needs, and the attractive location and comfortable location make us a better home of beauty that resists the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones was disbanded after Holly Willowbie refused to pay 11 million pounds of sterling.
The Dragons Den Peter Jones was disillusioned after Holly Willowby's television broadcast turned down the deal at 11 million pounds of sterling with his brand, which specializes in the image of life, to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
In Willowbie there is no time for branding goods for home and accessories True.
Business couples became like a brand of Guineat Peltrow Goop.
This morning the 37-year-old leader announced in Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willowby left the Dragon's Den Peter Jones star, which is now part of his profitable business to create brand clothes to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source reports that Jones was disillusioned when the golden girl admitted during a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business-imperial headquarters in Marlow (Bkingemshire), her new transactions up to 1.5 million pounds of Sterling mean that she would no longer have enough time to deal with domestic merchants and accessories of the brand True.
The business was similar to the brand of Guinea-Peltra Goop and was increased twice to double Willowby's profits by 11 million pounds of sterling.
When 37-year-old Willowbie announced in Instagram that she was leaving True, Jones flew from the United Kingdom and headed into one of his lodges.
The source said: True was the main priority of Holly.
It turned out to be her long-term future, which she would see in a couple of decades.
Her decision to refuse left all the participants utterly devastated.
No one wanted to believe what was happening on Tuesday, very soon had to start dinner.
In Marlow's headquarters there are warehouses full of goods ready for sale.
Experts suggest that the cost of leading this Morning, which goes into the number of the most important British stars, can cost millions of companies because of huge investments in different camps, from pillows and candles to clothing and household goods, and also because of possible further delays in their practice.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of Willowbie and Dan Baldwin's husband were close to Johns and his wife Tara Kapp for ten years.
Willowbie founded True & Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the headquarters in March.
The couple rest together, and Jones owns a 40-percent part of the Baldwin TV company.
Willowbie will be the representative of the M&S brand and replace Father McPartlin as the leading ITV "I'm a celebrity".
Last night the source, close to Johns, said, "We won't comment on his affairs."
A sincere conversation "after what we fell in love"
He made a joke against the criticism he received from the mass media for his commentary, which is considered to be "unpresidential" because it is always about the North Korean leader.
Why does President Trump refuse much?
Trump said to his favorite "discreet" voice.
"I don't deny anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first meeting in June in Singapore was announced by Trump as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the talk about denuclearization went on and on.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, the leading diplomat of North Korea, Lee Ann Ho, announced to the world leader at the General Assembly of AAN on Saturday that the North was not expected to be the "relevant West" of the United States in response to the previous steps of North Korea in the area of disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues to apply sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic position in his speech.
"We are very successful in building relationships with North Korea," he said.
"Everything could have ended with a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We're having a good time now."
He said that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim had led to positive results: the completion of missile testing, the rescue of hostages and the return of American troops at home.
And he defended his unusual approach in talking about relationships with Kim.
"Being on the President's side is very easy, but instead of 10,000 people trying to penetrate this crowded arena, we'll already have about 200 people there," said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunamis and the earthquake in Indonesia devastated the islands, hundreds of people died.
For example, after the earthquake on W. Lambok, a foreign non-profit organization said they were unnecessary.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lamboc's population were displaced, no national disaster was reported, which is the necessary condition for international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it was understood that they were not addressing international aid, so it was a bit difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although the Children's Education Fund (Save the Children) is collecting a mission to travel to Paul, it is not clear whether foreign employees can work in places.
Mr. Sutopa, a representative of the National Agency for the Fighting of Entrepreneurship, said that the Indian officials were evaluating the situation in Paul to find out if an international agency would be allowed to provide assistance.
Despite the earthquakes, which always survives Indonesia, the country is still well prepared for unexpected nature.
Although in Achae there were built shelters, in other coastal settlements they hardly had.
The apparent failure of the siren to warn the noises in Paul led to a greater number of victims, although the warning was.
Even in the best times, moving between many islands of Indonesia was a difficult task.
And stressful disasters have made moving logistics more complicated.
The hospital ship, which was located on the island of Lambok for the treatment of the earthquake, is approaching Pala, but the way to the new disaster site will take at least three days.
President Jock Oodda set up his pre-choice campaign to improve Indonesia's damaged infrastructure and to spend money on highways and gypsies.
But the lack of funding is after the administration of Joe, because next year there's going to be new choices.
Mr. Joe also faces pressure from the interconfessional tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority take more conservative Islam.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows and other cold weapons.
See: Daniel Starridge from Liverpool pushes a ball far away against Chelsea.
Daniel Starge rescued Liverpool from Chelsea's death in the Premier-Lise, increasing the number by 89 minutes on Saturday at the London Stemford Bridge.
The old man got a transmission from Jordan Shakyri when they were about 30 meters from the Chelsea gate, which was 1-0.
He made the find a ball left of himself before making a shot in a remote barn.
The attempt ended when the ball went right at the top of the network.
The result of the sword flew over the head of Kepha Arisabaly, which jumped directly into the net.
"He just tried to get in this position to hit the ball, and players like Chuck always tried to push as far as possible forward, so I just tried to win as much time as possible," said Starge in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Cante run away, made an easy dog, didn't think too much of it, and just hit the ball."
Chelsea went 1:0 at the beginning of the second time after the 25th minute, the Belgian star Eden Azar killed.
Attacking the blues in this match, he made a dog, Matthew Kovacic, before he returned to the semi-defence zone and ran into half the Liverpool field.
The cook quickly found himself in the middle of the field.
Then he made an effective blow by handing down the sword of Azar to the gate.
Azar ran away from the defense and went down to the lower left corner of the far side behind the guard of Liverpool, Elisha Becker.
Liverpool competes with the "Napali" at the team stage of the Champions League for 3 hours on Wednesday at the San-Paul Stadium in Italian Nepal.
Chelsea meets with Videoton at the Wefa Europe League in 3 hours on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of people who died as a result of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832, reported on Sunday morning to the Agency for the Eradication of Severe Disasters.
At the press conference, a representative of Sotopa Purvo Nugroho said that, according to the news, many people found themselves trapped in ruined buildings that collapsed as a result of a 7.5-ball earthquake, which took place on Friday, and called for a 7-metre earthquake.
The city of Pala, in which more than 380,000 people live, was surrounded by clouds of ruined buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man who was suspected of murder after he was murdered by a woman.
The murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhede this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 with horrible wounds in the Grayson-Museum area on John Street Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called for their people from this area who saw or heard something.
Inspector-inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in the early stages, but I would like to contact anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhede or who saw or heard anything suspicious, and ask for their contact with us.
I also call on everyone, in particular, the taxi driver, the video recorders who may have taken away some video, to contact us because they can have information that is extremely important to our research."
The police representative confirmed that the woman, the body that had been found, lived next to Birkenheid and was found in her own house.
Today's friend the women came to the scene to ask: where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have said it's in the process of informing the closest relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson-Museum just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He lost his tongue when he learned what had happened.
I'm living right now saying it'll be another few hours before they let them come back.

The parliamentary statue of Cromwell has become the last centuries of the “writing of history”.
His removal would be a poetic justice for him similar to the Taliban's destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts made by his fanatic Puritan followers.
"But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Creek's proposal as "fool" and "try to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, the head of the Cromwell Society, said: In the course of the current debate on the demise of the statue, it was inevitable that the memory of Oliver Cromwell near the Westminster Palace would be subject to these actions.
The icons of English civil wars were neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the poor Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestors Thomas in the previous century.
The bright presentation of Mr. William Ham Tornikroft about Cromwell is a witness of the 19th century's ideas and a part of the history of the action, which many consider to be worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith said The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people know from the end of the 19th century better than today, as a defender of Parliament from outside pressure, in his case it was a monarchy.
Is this a very accurate presentation, a subject of lengthy historical debates?
There is no doubt that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual cognitive figure that represents one of the sides of this encounter.
His achievements as a Lord-Procurator also deserve to be noted and respected."
The pig-killer has forced the Chinese farmer to die.
As local media reported, the farmer was attacked and killed by pigs on the market in southwestern China.
"The man, known only by the name of John, was found dead with a broken artery and a yellow blood, near the head of the Lupanish market in the Guizhow province," the newspaper South China Post reported on Sunday.
In May 2005, the swine fever began to enter the vaccine with lead in the Chinese province of Chinha.
It is reported that he and his cousin came from the nearby province of Junan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that the door in the neighboring pighouse was open.
He said that there was a great tan with blood on his feet.
According to the report, the medical expert confirmed that the 550-kilogram cane had decomposed the farmer.
"The feet of my cousin were blamed and damaged," said a cousin named Wu (according to the quotes Guiyang Evening News).
The video from the surveillance room showed that John went into the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to John or his cousin.
The market manager reported to Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent the attack on anyone else, while the police were collecting evidence at the scene.
According to the news, the family of Yuan and the market administration are going to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although pigs attack people, they are rare, but they were before.
Yes, in 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a weighing 650 pounds of pork pressed a Welsh farmer to his tractor and kept it that way until his wife fired the animal.
After a farmer from the state of Aregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a drop.
"They're just playful.
They're clever and very interrogative... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to give them the proper amount of respect," he said.
The remains of the Rose cause bring strong flood rains to the south-west of the United States.
According to the forecast, the Rose hurricane is weaker because it's moving over colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days of Rosa, she's taking floods in northern Mexico and in the south-west of the United States.
The speed of the Roses, hurricane 1 category, was 85 miles per hour in the morning at 5 o'clock on Sunday, and it was recorded in 385 miles south west of Punta-Euchenia in Mexico.
"Roza," as expected, moves north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific, the low-pressure area that moves east to the western coast of the United States begins to be formed. When, on Monday, “Roza” approaches the south of California like a tropical storm, it begins to push a deep tropical wet to the north, to the south-west of the United States.
On Monday, Rose will take some parts of Mexico up to 10 inches of waste.
Then the tropical wet, which interacts with the emerging low pressure area, in the next few days calls for strong rivers in the south-west.
Spaces from 1 to 4 inches of waste cause dangerous sudden floods, rural floods and possible flooding in the desert.
The deep tropical humidity will lead to the number of accidents in places will reach 2-3 inches per hour, especially in some areas of the south of Nevada and the Arizona.
In some parts of the north-west, especially in most of the Arizona, it's expected from 2 to 4 inches of waste.
Due to the ungrouped areas of tropical rain, a possible sudden flood with a condition of rapid deterioration of conditions.
It would be very undesirable to go out into the desert of a foot due to the possibility of a tragic accident.
A strong rain may lead to what the canyons turn into bubbling rivers, and the rain will be accompanied by a rainy wind and dust.
The emerging low-pressure area brings strong rain to parts of the South California coast.
Possible nightmares more than a half can lead to a small stream of garbage and make the slippery roads.
It'll be the first stream in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains start approaching the Arizona at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of Monday before the rain goes everywhere at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The strong rain will spread in the area of the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
In October, strong temperatures can be observed in the United States, as the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropics remain rather warm.
This sometimes leads to a sharp change in the temperature in the near future.
There's a good example of a sharp drop in temperature in Central America on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Amhai, Nebraska, St. Louis, and De Moyn, Iowa, the temperature ranges almost 20 degrees.
For the next few days the summer heat will try to grow and expand again.
It is expected that in many central and eastern United States countries, a warm, 80-degree temperature - from the South to the North-East - will begin.
The temperature in New York can reach 80 degrees per Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a high probability of higher temperatures in the eastern United States until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Cavan’s hearings.
More than 20 million people on six television networks were watching interesting demonstrations of witnesses on Thursday at the Supreme Court on the case between Brett Kavan and Christian Blaise Ford, who accused him of sexual violence, which was estimated to have occurred in the 1980s.
At the same time, political resistance continues, the press interrupted their regular programs for the benefit of the extraordinary news in Friday: the conspiracy, developed by the federal security officer, Jeff Flake, was about to carry out a weekly investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate court board that she was 100% sure that the Cavan drink had grabbed her and tried to get her clothes off for dinner at the senior school.
The coffee in his bare witness said that 100% sure it wasn't.
Probably more than 20.4 million people who Nielsen's company reported on Friday were looking at him.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available for other networks that showed this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen's company usually has problems with people who watch television in offices.
To compare: The size of the audience is the same as when playing in the play-off or Oscar prize.
"The Fox News channel, whose experts strongly supported the Cavan's mission, managed all networks on average with 5.69 million viewers throughout the day," Nielsen said.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million spectators.
"CBS had 3.1 million, NBC was 2.94 million, MSNBC was 2.89 million, and CNN was 2.52 million," Nielsen said.
The interest remained high and after listening.
Flake was the main figure of the drama on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in support of the Cavan, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning when the protestors shouted at his address and when he tried to climb the elevator to listen to the Judicial Committee.
He was standing with his eyes closed for a few minutes when he was being licked, and it was broadcast in the direct effigy on the CNN channel.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
“What do you think he is telling the truth in the country?
They said to him, "You have power, but many women have delivered her."
Felix said that his office had published the statement, and informed him before the elevator closed that he still had something to say at the hearings in the committee.
All the cable and wire networks for a few hours increased the direct broadcast when the Judicial Committee had to vote on the question of the selection of the Cavan's candidacy at the Senate headquarters.
But Flake said that he would do it, only by understanding that the FBI would consider charges against the candidate for the next week, which the Democrats call for from a minority.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Senator-Democrat Chris Kunsam.
After the conversation with Kunsa and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Felix's choice was strong, because it was obvious that in the Republics there would be no votes to confirm the Cave without investigation.
President Trump began investigating the charges against the Kavana in the FBI.
Prime Minister of Great Britain May blames the criticism of "games in politics" on the grounds of a brief
During a Sunday Times interview with Prime Minister Teresa, I have been accused of criticizing the fact that she plans to leave the European Union, that they are "playing politics" with future Britain, and that they are ruining national interests.
Prime Minister Teresa May arrived at the Conservative Party conference in British Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In an interview with her in the first field of the paper, she was the foreign minister of the Boris Johnson case, who spoke against her so-called "sexaquent" plan on the brexit, stating that the suggestion that Britain and the EC have the only tariffs was "very wrong".
The murder of Wade Sims: The police arrested a suspect in the death of the LSU player Dayton Simpsan.
Police arrested a dead shot at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana University.
"The 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and put in prison for a second-degree murder," Baton-Russia police chief reported.
The cops showed a video of shooting between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the shooting.
"The police took the oculars from the scene and said they found Simpsan's DNA," said WAFB, a CBS branch.
After the Simpson investigation, the police said that he had confessed to the death penalty in Wade.
“The cost of the loan is set at $350,000,” Advocate reported.
The next correction of East Batan-Russia published a previous report on Friday, which says that cause of death is a gunshot wound in the head and neck.
The Department of the Operational Police Group of the state of Louisiana, the criminal lab of the state police, the South University Police, is asking residents of the area for assistance in research that would support the arrest.
Louisiana University Sports Director Joe Aleve thanked the District Court for his "old-fashionedness and interest in justice".
Simsus was only 20 years old.
As he grew up, he grew up in Baton-Russia, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana University.
In the middle of the last season, he picked 5.6 points, 2.6 points for the game.
On Friday morning, a basketball coach at the University of Louisiana, Will Wade, said that the team was "destroyed" and "in shock" from Wade's death.
"That's what I always worry about," Wade said.
The volcano brings ash to Mexico
The ash, which is carved out of the volcano of Papacketeptel, reached the southern regions of the Mexico capital.
The National Center for the Warning of Sick Disasters on Saturday suggested that Mexicans stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and 183 cases of gas and ashes were recorded for 24 hours.
In the center was a squeezing and felt a push.
The images on the social media showed that in the neighborhoods of Mexico, like Shechem, there are thin layers of palisman cover on an automatic windshield.
Geophysics have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 45 miles (72 km) from the south-east of the site following the earthquake of 7.1 in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don-Goa, has remained active since 1994.
Match police with Catalan separatists before voting year for independence
On Saturday in Barcelona, six people were arrested after the independence supporters met with the police on civil order, and thousands of others joined the demonstration for the first anniversary of the polarization vote in Catalonia's department.
A group of sepharatists in masks, who met the police in civil order, laid their eggs and blossomed in Paris, creating dark dust clouds on the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later that same day, the fighting broke out when the police used their dins to hold the demise.
For a few hours, a group of struggles for independence, which were scandalous, "Don't forget, don't give up," met with the present professionals, who were shouting, "Live Spain."
According to local press reports, fourteen people have been treated from minor injuries received in protest proceedings.
The tension in the region that seeks independence remains high a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid recognized as illegal, but which was marked by separatists.
The voters mostly took the advantage of independence, although the voter's expression was low, which was largely interpreted by the vote party.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured after the police tried to stop voting in the polling stations throughout the region as a result of the actions of the angry demonstrators.
Groups who speak for independence spent the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the Spanish National Police.
The demonstration continued, but the protestors were forced to go another way.
68-year-old Narsis Termes, an electrician who attends a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer expects to gain independence from Catalonia.
"In summer we survived one of the best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy when they could vote, but now we are tired," he said.
In spite of the important but minor victory of the regional elections last November, the Catalan parties that speak for independence tried to preserve momentum this year with many of their most well-known leaders and found themselves either in voluntary exile or in exile, waiting for the court to organize the referendum and the next declaration of independence.
42-year-old mechanic Jean Poch, who writes a protest in support of the police on the phone, said that the conflict was affected by politicians on both sides.
"Be more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Junckeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in the CIS, announced that he would participate in the elections in the European Parliament next year.
"The choice as a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repressions that we saw on the part of the Spanish government," he said.
Londoners: The men arrested after the house was demolished on the car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after their car suddenly broke into a house in London.
Ingent happened in the Belinagard-Crecent District on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Bob Blemings said it was damaged by the gate and the building itself.
Maybe at some point in the car a bullet was released.
"Liveington" hit wins Rangers with the number 1:0
The first goal of the Dolly Mangy for the benefit of Lionstown has given them victory
The success of "Levinston" was by the Rangers, and it was a trap to target Steven Gerard after him with a few losses in 18 games for the Ibrox Club Manager's possession.
The Dolly Mangy hit was great, because Gary Holt got up on one level with the "Hibernian" in the second division.
The Gerard team in this season won't win out in the premier league, and the next week it meets with the leaders, the Harts team, who's standing at eight points.
Until then, Rangers in Europe has been taking Rapids on Thursday.
"Livingstan," meanwhile, continued his sinless series in the division to six games, and Chief Coach Holt still feels right after Kenie Miller's replacement last month.
"Livingstan" misses chances because of rough visitors
Holt's command was to warn the long before they killed, but such a move caused the Rangers a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke down, but lost his chance to kill himself in the gate, after which Alan Litgo could only direct his efforts wider to meet Craig Halket's blow.
The owners were pleased to allow Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could bother the guest in a few moments.
And that's exactly how the main goal was achieved.
The Rangers were allowed a criminal blow, and the Lioningstan was working on a debate, Declan Gallagher and Robinson gathered to overcome Mango, who made a passport and killed him from the center of the field.
Until now the Rangers had dominated, but found that the defense of the command was unfavourable, and the port of Liam Kelly was practically inactive.
So it went on in the second half, although Alfred Marelas really saved Kelly.
The sword from Scott Pitman was shot by the Rangers' shield by Alan McGregor, and the Litgos had gone far away from the second set of Lionstown.
The swords were constantly entering the gate of "Leviington" and were shot, while two demands of the pen, after Halket was called for the replacement of Glenn Midleton, and the demand for punishment by the hand of the game were rejected.
"Penomen" by "Livingstan" - analysis
BBC Scotland journalist Alexander Lamant on Arena Tony Macaroni
Great productivity and results for "Livingstan".
For men they were wonderful, continuing to pass over waiting on this outgoing trajectory.
Their style of play and composition have practically not changed since they were returned to the higher eschalon, but it is worth giving the right Holta for how he stimulated the team from the moment of his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was a huge, raising well-organized defense, while Manga held Konar Goldsan and Joe Ural all over the field.
Rangers didn't get the inspiration.
No matter how good they were at Jared's, they didn't meet those standards.
In the last match they didn't own a ball, only once they killed in the door, which was something like an alarming call for Rangers, which was found in the middle of the list.
Mixed view of Erdagana in Köllna
On Saturday, 29 September, they saw a smile and felt baseless flying when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erragan's visit to Germany, which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They argued about the human rights problem, the freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EC.
Erdagan headed to Cologne to open a new giant ball.
In this city, the largest number of Turkish populations outside of Turkey lives.
The police have fled for security reasons not to allow 25,000 people to meet in front of the ball, but close to a lot of supporters to see their president.
Hundreds of protesting against Erdaghan, many of whom were Kurds, also expressed their opinion, condemning both the politician Erdaghan and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Protests for and against the protests on behalf of the guest, whose one German Turks reported to the hero, and the other convicted as an autocrat.
DTZ in Deptfarde: The same was true when the car crashed.
Raverter died as a result of a car crash in London.
Avarya took place near the crossing of the streets of Bejudd Street and Evelyn Street, a lively road in Deptford, on the south-east of the city, about 10:15 a.m.
The driver stopped, the doctors arrived, but the man died in the place.
The crash took place a few months after another ravarian died as a result of a encounter at Childders Street, about a mile from the site of the Saturday accident.
The static police reported that their colleagues were working on identifying a person and informing him of his closest relatives.
Around that place there are roadside and bus stops, and the car driver was recommended to avoid this area.
Long-Lartin Tower: Six employees injured during riots
"Six prison officials have been injured as a result of riots in a strict regime for men," the Penitentiary Correction reports.
The riots erupted in Long Lartin's prison in Austria at around 09:30 a.m. on Sunday and continue until then.
In order to fight the disorder in which the eight prisoners are placed in one wing, a special group called "Tarnada" was drawn.
In the workplace, employees have been treated from minor traumas.
A representative of the Penitentiary Service said: "The specially trained torture personnel was directed to combat those who committed disorder in Long Lartin prison.
Six employees went to the hospital after they got trauma.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and we understand that the guilty will be handed over to the police and can spend more time behind bars."
The Royal Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the principal of the prison was undergoing treatment in the hospital after the arrest of the prisoner.
And in October last year, police officers on civil order were summoned to prison to deal with serious riots, during which the officers were subjected to attacks with water polo balls.
The rose hurricane threatens the city of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with strong floods (which can be useful for dry regions)
The tropical hurricanes rarely occur in Arizona, but that's exactly what can happen early next week, because there are traces of the pink hurricane in the south-west part of the desert that poses a risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already published data on sudden floods in the western Arizona and in the south and east Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lakes.
It's expected that Rose will take a straight path through Phoenix, approaching the rain on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that “only ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or a drop of pressure within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was injured 40 miles from the border with the state of Arizona."
The latest model of the National Center of Hurricanees predicts the occurrence of accidents from 2 to 4 inches, with individual levels reaching 6 inches in the region of Magalion in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it's probably going to fall from 1 to 2 inches, with this individual value being equal to 4 inches.
For those who are beyond the risk of sudden flooding, the "Rosa" hurricane could be long-lasting, because their region is suffering from drought.
Although the flood is a very serious problem, some of these cases are likely to be useful, because in the south-west of the present time the droughts are being observed.
According to data from the U.S. Drought Monitoring Agency, Arizona is experiencing an extraordinary second category drought," reports weather.com.
First of all, the path of the Rose hurricane leads to the peaks of the Mexican highlands of Lower California.
On Sunday morning, Rose still had the power of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour in 385 miles south of Punta-Euchenia in Mexico, and was moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is meeting with colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, so it's quiet.
So it's expected that in Mexico when a tropical storm comes, there will be an exit of the river from the shores of the day or the evening on Monday.
Accidents in various parts of Mexico can be strong, which creates a significant risk of warming.
"There are expected to be a total number of accidents from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to the northwest of Sanlar, where possible accidents up to 10 inches," reports weather.com.
Then "Russia" will move north through Mexico like a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border early in the morning like a tropical pressure drop, which will then continue through the Arizona and south of Utah until Tuesday evening.
"The main danger is expected from Roses or its remains, it's very strong rain in Lower California and in the north-west of Sanora and the South-West desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center reported.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening and sudden floods and rural streams and floods in the upper part of the village.
The attack in Midsummer Norton: four attempts to arrest the killers
Three teenage boys and 20-year-old boys were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old body with a lot of horrible wounds in Summersett.
Three teenage boys were found injured in the Terasa Excelsior district of Midsummer Norton about 4 hours on Saturday.
He was delivered to a hospital where he remained in a stable state.
"The 17-year-old boys and both others, 18 and 20-year-olds, were arrested at night in Redstock, Avon and Samersett," the police said.
The police turned to anyone who could have any evidence on the mobile phone of what happened to move on in their search.
"The coven is aching from the reality and anger of the Democratic Party," Trump said.
"The vote for Judge Kavano is a vote for the abolition of the unscrupulous and absurd tactics of the Democratic Party," Tramp reported on the rally in Willing, East Virginia.
Trump stated that Cavano was "absolutely angry and angry" by the Democratic Party in the process of selecting him for a post.
Cavano showed up in front of Congress on Thursday, intensely and emotionally denying the charges of Christian Blaise Ford that he had sexually raped her for decades when they were still teenagers.
Ford also showed up while hearing about her accusation.
On Saturday, the President stated that "on this day the Americans saw a brilliant, quality and courageous character" Cavano.
"The voice in support of Judge Kavano is the voice of one of the most perfect experts in the field of law of our time, a lawyer from the excellent history of State service," he said to the crowd of supporters of West Virginia.
The President turned his attention to the Cavano election, talking about the importance of the Republic in the period of interim elections.
"Five weeks remained to one of the most important choices of our time.
I'm not just late, I'm really late," he answered.
"That's why I'm competing everywhere for big candidates."
The Trump disagrees that the Democrats intend to "oppose and hinder".
"It is expected that the first key procedural vote at the Senate level will take place not later than Friday," CNN informed the senior Deputy Head of Parliament.
Hundreds of people died as a result of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of people suffering has increased
"At least 384 people died, many people disappeared as a result of the wave of giant waves on the beaches, when on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi started a huge earthquake and tsunami," the government said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palo on Friday, when they waved six feet (18 feet) to fight about the beach in shelters, killing many to death and destroying everything on their way.
As a result of the earthquake of 7.5 magnets, tsunamis occurred.
"When the threat of tsunamis came up yesterday, people were still on the beach and not running away, and they became victims," said Sotopo Purvo Nugroho at a briefing in Jakarta, the president of the Indonesian disaster relief agency.
"The noises pulled the cars, the beers, the houses, hitting everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the noises passed through the open sea at 800 km/h (up to 497 miles/h) before the impact on the shoreline.
According to his words, some people survived just because they got up on trees to run away from the tsunamis.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 center of Paul.
The photos published by the relief agency showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, the masts turned and collapsed, and the ball was surrounded by water.
The following strikes continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the area with a population of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for Assessment and Exploitation Technology (BPPT) reported that energy released as a result of a strong earthquake on Friday is about 200 times higher than the nuclear bomb power dropped on Hirashim in World War II.
According to his data, the city's geography, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunamis.
The mayor called the damage a "wide" and announced that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and guesthouses were destroyed.
According to his words, the bodies of some victims were found under the debris of broken buildings, adding that 540 people were injured, and 29 were missing without a report.
"The victims and damage can be larger along the coast line 300 km (190 miles) north of Pala, the area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake," Nugroh said.
Dongal's relationship "was completely damaged," Nugroh said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living," says the Red Cross, adding that his colleagues and volunteers were directed to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be a lot worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting the noises in Paul, but the reporters say that the waves came at a time when a warning was given.
In amateur photos published on social media, you can hear a man on the top of a building shouting the people on the street warning of the coming tsunamis.
Within a few minutes the water wall fell on the shore, pulling behind the building and the car.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the withdrawn material.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused a serious power failure, which disrupted communications around Paul, so it was difficult for the government to remember saving actions.
According to the authorities, the soldiers began to direct cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated still very much needed food and other items of first necessity.
The city's airport was opened only to provide assistance and will be closed by October.
On Sunday, President Joco Vía planned to visit the evacuation centers in Paul.
As a result of the tsunamis in Indonesia, more than 800 people were killed
It's very bad.
"While World Vision colleagues from Dangala had successfully headed to the city of Paul, where workers were hiding in bristal caves set up in their offices' courts, they had seen desert scenes along the way," said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw a lot of broken houses," he reported.
It's very bad.
Even if the aid groups were to start dark action at the start of disaster relief mechanisms, some complained that foreign workers who have deep knowledge were prevented from going to Paul.
According to the Indonesian rule, funding, supplies and personnel outside of borders can only begin to occur if the disaster is reported by a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, the president of the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can open up for international help, but this status is not yet available.
On the second night in Pala, after the earthquake and tsunamis on Friday, the friends and family of the missing ones hoped that their close miracles would be among those who would leave the unsatisfied Soviet lines of distress.
On Saturday, a little boy was kicked out of the sewer.
On Sunday the saviors released a woman who had been under the ruins for two days, and next to her was the body of her child.
Hendon Subadon, an Indonesian national paraplanery team coach, prepared two of the missing paraplanes for Asian games that were completed early this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandago, in that number and others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, were his students.
"As the oldest in the branch of paraplaneism, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Hendon told us how a few hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel had spread among the communities of paraplanetists, he desperately sent messages to whatsapp participants in Palu who were at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked by one grey ring, not two blues.
"That means the messages were not delivered," he said.
The thieves stole $26,750 while relieving the banknotes in Newport on the left.
"In the morning of Friday, the thief stole $26,750 from Brinka's employee, who had invested in a banknote in Newport on Levi," reported Newport Police Department.
"The driver of the car dropped the ATM into a fun complex and was willing to deliver more money," wrote Dennis McCarti in the release.
While he was busy, another man "run away from Brinka's employee" and stole me with money destined for delivery.
According to the report, the witnesses noticed a number of suspects who left the scene, but the police didn't add to the number of incidents.
Anyone who has information about them should contact the Newport police on the phone 859-292-3680.
Kane West: The Raper renames its name to Ye ("ti").
The Rapper Kanye West changes its name to Y.
Speaking of a name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "I'm officially known as Kane West."
A West, 41 years old, according to Y, used this variable as a name for its eighth album that came out in June.
Changes take place before his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to run his new Yandhi album.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande for a show, which was dismissed for "emotional reasons," said the show's creator.
At the same time as abbreviation of his current professional name, West previously said that this word had a religious significance for him.
I believe that "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it is "you," said West early this year, considering the name of the album with the radio-leading Big Boy.
So I'm -- it's you, it's me, it's us, it's all us --
It came from Kane, which means "one" to just Ye" -- a reflection of our good, our bad, our waste, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
He was one of the most famous rappers who had changed his name.
Sean Combs was obviously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he was inclined to the names Love and Brother Love.
The former employee of Westa, Jay-Ze, also walked without confusion and the general letters.
AMLO in Mexico promises not to use armies against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel Lopez Abrador, has never used military force against civil society, as the country is about 50 years from the day of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday at the Square of Tlatelolco Plaza Lopes Abrador, the fans "never use soldiers to satisfy the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, the soldiers launched a peaceful demonstration on the field, resulting in the death of about 300 people, at a time when the left-wing student movements swept across Latin America.
Lopez Abrador encouraged the students to support young Mexicans by issuing monthly grants to those who were learning, thus opening freer places at state universities.
"The unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups," he said.
The United States must double its machine-intellected funding
"As China becomes increasingly active in the field of machine intelligence, the United States has to double the amount they spend on research in this field," says an investor and machine specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who worked on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after the various parts of the U.S. government made claims about MI, even if there is no official MI strategy in the U.S.
Meanwhile, last year China presented its plan: by 2030, it is trying to be the first in the field of innovation.
"The implementation of the MI research budget would be a good start, considering that all other countries are leaving the United States, and we are waiting for the next gap in MI," said Lee.
"Funding can double the likelihood of the next major achievement in the United States," Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, published this month by Houton Mifflin Harkurt, is the lead executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most famous MlI companies in China, Face +.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie-Melean, he worked on a machine intelligence system that won the highest-ranking American Attel player, and later he was the Microsoft Research Manager and president of the Chinese Google Department in China.
Whether he recognized the previous U.S. government technical cooperation, such as the Agency's workshop on a forward research project in the field of protection, and asked if it would be possible to help identify the following indicators.
"The U.S. researchers often have a lot to do to get state grants," Lee said.
"It's not China that picks up academic leaders; it's corporate," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have recently hired high-tech students from universities to work on the media.
Lee said that changing immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the field of machine intelligence (MI).
"I think green cards should automatically be offered by the candidate in the MI branch," he said.
In July 2017, China's State Council issued a plan for the development of machine intelligence for the next generation.
"China's National Science Fund provides funding to people in educational institutions, like the National Science Fund and other state organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China below," said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence created a United Nations machine intelligence centre to involve industrial partners and scientific circles, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Machine Intelligence.
And in this month, the Agency's forward research project in the field of protection reported investment of $2 billion called AI Next.
As for the National Scientific Organization (NSF), it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in MI research.
Meanwhile, the United States leadership, which tried to create the Commission's national security for machine intelligence, did not observe the actions for a few months.
Macedonians refer to a reference for changing country names
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted on a referendum to change their name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", which allows us to resolve a ten-year conflict with Greece, which blocked applications for participation in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, whose province is Macedonia, claims that its neighbor's name is a claim on its territory, and has vowed to join NATO and EC.
In June, both governments concluded a deal with the proposed new name, but nationalist officials claim that these changes undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian population of Macedonia.
President Georgie Ivanov said he wouldn't vote on the referendum, and the Byikot company questioned whether the voters would meet at least 50 percent of the referendum required.
The question of voting on the referendum suggests: "You are a member of NATO and the EC with the consent of Greece."
The proponents of the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, claim that it is a cost that should be paid for admission to such bodies as EC and NATO Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to call for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Oliver Georgiev, 79 years old, Skopje.
Although this is not a mandatory legal force, enough Members of Parliament have stated that they will count the results of voting to make it decisive.
Changing the name requires more than two thirds of Parliament.
The National Elections Commission has stated that no violations were committed within 1 hour of the day.
However, the strike made a total of 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old elector at Skopje Tanevsky's headquarters.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, his wife Zaritz and his son Duška voted for a referendum in Macedonia, dedicated to changing the country's name, which will open the way for her entry into NATO and the European Union, in Stromika, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
Prior to the building of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kvardark, 54 years old, he set up a small scene and placed chairs in front of the tents, set up by those who would party to the referendum.
"We're with NATO and the EU, but we want to be united with our heads raised, not through the service door," Kavadark said.
"We are a poor country, but we have pride.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zayev said that friendship in NATO is taking the necessary investment in Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20 percent.
"I think the overwhelming amount will be "for," because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EC and NATO," said Zaev after the vote.
He said that the result of "yes" would be "the confirmation of our future."
In a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies, it is said that the referendum will take part from 30 to 43 percent of voters, which is below the required gap.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian telephony showed 57 percent of the respondents planning to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they were saying yes.
For a successful egg referendum there must be 50 percent plus one voice.
Failure in the referendum will be the first serious political blow from the moment it came in May of last year.
See: Sergei Aguaira from Manchester City goes to the gate across the entire Brytan border
On Saturday, Sergei Aguay and Rahim Sterling solved the problem of protecting from Britain by winning Manchester City with 2:0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
At the 65th minute, Aguaro made it easy.
The Argentine attacker got a passport in the center of the field.
He raced between the three British defenders before hitting the open field.
Then Aguara found herself among the four green shirts.
He went to one defence and waved a few more on the edge of the British field.
Then he pushed the dog on the left flank, finding Sterling.

"Agueira has some problems with her legs," said a journalist in the city of Pep Guardiello.
"We talked about how he played 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he killed a naked man at the same time."
But that's exactly what Sirling gave Sky Blues the initial advantage of fighting in the Prime Minister.
This goal took place in 29 minutes.
Aguara got this ball at the depth of the British territory.
He sent a beautiful ball through the left flank to Leroy Sun.

Shercer wants to play the "receptive points" role against the Year
After the Nationals had been shut off from co-operation in the play-off, there was no particular reason to delay a new start.
But the ever-changing Shercer is hoping to take a blow on Sunday against the Rocky Calarada, but only when there will still be a play-off for Rocky, who remain in the leaders after one game with Los Angeles Dodgers in the North West.
Years went by, at least, a unique place with a victory number 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still hope to get their first title in the division.
"Even in spite of what we're playing just so, at least, we can deal with the situation, knowing that the atmosphere here, in Denver, with the crowd and another team will be composed so that the game will probably be at the highest level of all I've ever met this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be involved in this?
The Nationals haven't announced the start on Sunday yet, but they're reportedly willing to give the Sherry a sword in such a situation.
The Sherry, who was going to do her 34th start, held the PSC session on Thursday and will be on Sunday at regular rest.

Trump in West Virginia
The President has taken a stand for the situation around his choice of Brett Kavano's Supreme Court, speaking of the importance of the expression of Republicans in interim elections.
"All we've done is under threat in November.
Five weeks from one of the main choices in our life.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not late, I'm really late, so I'm fighting everywhere for the big candidates," he said.
The trumpet went on, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, see what's going on right now.
And they are determined to return to power, using any necessary means you see -- reality, measure.
They don't care who they blame, who they have to beat to get power and control, that's what they want, that's power and control that we're not going to give them."
According to his words, the Democrats intend to “oppose and hinder”.
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "bad, bad, vice-versa, and false."
He fled to the Senate's judicial committee for the prior recognition of the Senator of the Democratic Group of Diana Feynstein, who received a sound rating from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you allow a document to be imported?
Uh, that.
No, I don't expect -- it was a very bad nonverbal language -- the worst language I've ever seen."
The work is no longer the main church.
It is impatience for those who express their opinion
When Activists Momentum in my local party voted in favour of wounding me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I'm the last in a number of Members of Parliament from a Liberian party to whom we're told we're not welcome, all to express our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, got a similar answer because she was determined to resist anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censor revealed to me that I did not agree with Jeremy Corbin.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, about the irony of fate, such issues that Jeremy didn't agree with previous leaders.
The news of the meeting, which was established on Friday by the Nottingham East Liberian party, says that "we want these meetings to be consistent and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Liberian party, precisely such a meeting was on Friday.
Unfortunately, today at most the encounter tone is not such and the promise of a “more good, more soft” policy has long been forgotten, if ever.
It becomes increasingly evident that in the Liberian party different views are not allowed, and every opinion is appreciated by that view, it is essential for party leadership or not.
It started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, because colleagues I used to think shared similar political views, began to expect me to take a step back, and took positions that I would never agree with – in matters of national security or in the single EU market.
Every time I speak in public -- and it doesn't matter what I say -- there's a bunch of social networks that call for the abolition of elections, condemning the policy of the centre, saying that I'm no longer in the Liberian Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I was more fortunate than any of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me, as a rule, are political.
I am delighted with the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who meet each day with the flow of sexual or racist effects, but they never waver.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of the level of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said the Labarist Party must develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're no longer an organization that has different views, and with every movement of "insecurity" or change of party selection rules, it's getting worse.
For the past two years I have been given a lot of advice, which have called me not to fall in spirit, not to be so loud, and then everything will be fine with me.
But that's not what I went into politics for.
Since I joined the Liberian 32 years ago as a school student, who was responsible for the neglect of the Tatcher government, because of which my teacher in the school system had fallen, I have tried to resist the best public services for those who need them more than anything else -- whether it's a local resident or a government minister.
I've never hidden my political views, that's the number of previous elections.
No one in East Notingham could ever get involved in my political positions and areas of conflict with the current leadership.
For those who have fought for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that, if the country is headed for Brexit, which brings harm to the homeowner, to the businesses and to our state service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and the strength of my loyalty to the leader of the Liberian party.
But in fact the only message I have is not Nottingham Momentum, it's my electors, or it's the members of the labyrist, or it's not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that there's no danger that the choices will be and the political ambition will not prevent me from acting in the interests of all of you.

Air-Melrous 38 - 17: Invincible Air on top
Two late attempts, perhaps, had some cut the final result, but, no doubt, Air deserved a triumph in this curiously interesting game of the Tenent's Prime Minister's League.
Now they're marking the tournament table, one side of ten.
After all, it was their highest defense, just as their best chances of making their masters, coach Peter Morcy's death had the full right to be satisfied.
"We have still tried our games so far, and we are still invincible, so I must be happy," he said.
The robin of Christy of Melroves said, "Give the proper Air, he's braved more than we are."
The 14-minute experiment Grant Anderson, converted by Fraser Klim, put Ira in the foreground, but the yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, obtained for the Warriors' game, allowed Melrovus to swallow the numbers, and Jason Baggot caught up with an unrealized attempt.
Klimov extended the leadership of Eiro with the help of the pen, before, immediately in a stop, he killed, and then strengthened the salt try, making 17-5 Eiro in a stop.
But Melrows had well begun the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, turned over to Bogotá, shortened the distance to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious trauma of Ruarth Nott, which was stretched, and after the resumption of Air moved further through the attempt of Staffard McDawel, realized by the Clima.
Air, carrying out Captain Blair Mcferson's duties, got a yellow card, and once again Melroves forced another man to pay with the help of an unrealised attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the February pressure.
However the gentlemen returned, and when Stroan Hatcherson got a yellow card for what he had chosen Climas without a ball from a criminal line, McFerson landed behind Eiro.
Klimov realized his attempt, which he made again almost after the resumption, after Kyle Row got David Armstrong's hit in the fine and sent Flander Henry to the fifth attempt of the masters of the field.
A Still Game star, like ready for a new career in a restaurant business
However, the Ford Kieran game star is going to enter the hospitality business industry after it turned out that it was appointed by the director of the licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor is playing Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show he's writing, and he's filming with an old comedy partner named Greg Hemfil.
The duet announced that the next nine series would be the last in the show series, and it seems Kernan's planning to move on after Creegleg.
According to official records, he's the director of Aeringmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the source of the Scottish Sun found that Kernan was hoping to participate in the "flowering trade in the Glass."
"Our sea": Bolivia, which has no way out to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
The Maracas patrol the military headquarters in La Pase.
Civil buildings under the blue flag.
In the military-martial bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the word "the sea is ours on the right" is painted.
Renewing is our duty.
In all of Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, the memory of the coast line lost by Chile in a bloody conflict due to the resources of the 19th century, is still alive, as is the intention to sail on the Pacific again.
These hopes may have reached maximum peaks in the last decade, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of debate.
"Balivia has a impulse, a spirit of unity and peace, and, of course, it is waiting for a positive outcome," said Balivian diplomat Robert Calsadilla.
Many Bolivians will be watching the decision of the media on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will, after decades of intense talks, support Bolivia's statement that Chile is obliged to conduct talks on the provision of Bolivia's sovereign exit to the sea.
Eva Marales is the charismatic president of Bolivia, who is faced with a fight against re-election in the coming year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of October.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly take a decision for the benefit of Bolivia, and it's a bit of a change, even if it does.
The AAN organization, based in the Netherlands, has no right to make decisions on Chile's territory and has stated that it will not determine the source of possible talks.
What the International Court of Justice's ruling is only six months after the final arguments were considered is to prove that the case was “not complex”, according to a Chinese expert in Paz Zarate International Law.
And far away from pursuing Bolivia's affairs, the last four years may have left her behind.
"The problem of access to the sea was manipulated by the current Bolivian administration," Sarat said.
According to her words, the fighting knight Maralez lost the rest of Chilean well-being.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but then the discussion will be very difficult.
Since 1962, two countries have not been exchanged by mail.
The former President Edward Radríguez Wellte, representative of Bolivia in Gaza, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia "is the unique opportunity to open up a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "the end of 139 years of interdependence," he said.
Colossians also denied that Marales, another of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the marine problem as a political resistance.
"The White One will never refuse his right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The stop is the opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not happen until they can trust the United States
Minister of Foreign Affairs North Korea Rhy Young Ho says his country will never cease to use its nuclear weapon until he can trust Washington.
Riya spoke on Saturday at the AAN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to carry out the promises reached during the summit in Singapore among the leaders.
His comments come from the United States.
Riya says it's a "unfortunate dream" to continue the sanctions and the U.S. opposition to the declaration of the end of the war in Korea ever put the North on his knees.
Washington is afraid to agree with the statement if Phejiang doesn't first start a significant resolution.
And Kim, and the president of the United States Donald Trump demand a second summit.
But there's great skepticism on the part that Phanyan is seriously dealing with the rejection of the arsenal, which the country is probably considering as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompey plans to visit the Pyrenees in the following months to prepare for the second Kim-Tramp summit.
On Parisian fashion shows we saw the newest line in massive head dresses on the way to shop in your cities
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or close the sun completely, you can no longer search.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced an enormous amount of unusually high-end clothes for their SS19 collection, which exceeded the expectations of Paris Fashion Week.
In this summer, Instagram has attracted the popularity of non-practice hats that designers have sent their faces to the podium.
Valentino's famous drawing was a luxurious coastal hat, decorated by wide fields, similar to the feathers that filled the heads of the models.
Other accessories of an unusually large size included a collection of precious stones of coffee, a hat of wizards and even pineapple, but they were not meant to keep their head warm.
So Brown also showed a set of wise-ass masks -- just before Halloween.
Many of the different color masks were with dried lips and more reminded of the Gannibal Lekter than the high fashion.
One of them reminded me of a sailboat with a tube and a hidden eyelid, and the other similar to a frozen cone.
And if you continue to stick to the huge attributes of fashion, you're lucky.
Those who look at the style predict that huge hats can go through our all-round life.
The hats of a huge size go five to La Bomba, a salami hat with two-footed furs, which can be seen in all, from Ryan to Emily Ratakovski.
A cult label on a very uncomfortable hat, which was loose in social networks, has promoted another big face on the floor -- a salami beach bag, almost as big as a model with this bag, dressed in a buyer.
The dark orange bag of the Rafia, drawn with an awning of the Rafia and covered with a white leather handle, became an excellent part of the collection Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 on Week Fashion in Paris.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage said FEMAIL: "I look forward to seeing large hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer, as the designer had a great impact, and it would be difficult to ignore attempts on non-profit accessories."
John Edward: Language practice is a necessary skill for all citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland maintain academic success, which has continued since 2018 with yet another excellent result of exams that are supported by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community start-ups.
Over 30,000 students all over Scotland, schools represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to ensure a better level of work for their students and parents.
Independent schools try to prepare their students for further higher education, chosen by their careers and their places as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you talk to a man in the language he understands, it stays in his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart."
It's a bright reminder that we can't expect only in English if I want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
From the results of the last exams this year, we see that languages are the first places in the league tables with the highest scores in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher score of A.
The data collected in 74 SCIS participating schools showed that 72 percent of students reached higher grade A in Chinese, while 72 percent were students of German, 69 percent were French, and 63 percent were Spanish, and they also reached level A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages such as vital life skills that are undoubtedly needed by children and young people in the future.
Now languages as objects are selected as STEM objects (studies, technology, engineering and mathematics) in educational programs of independent schools and elsewhere.
The survey conducted by the UK Employment and Training Commission in 2014 showed that 17 percent of the reasons for the difficulties faced by employers in filling vacancies were related to the lack of language skills.
So more and more language skills become necessary to prepare young people for future careers.
In view of the more promising workplaces that require language learning, these skills become necessary in a globalized world.
No matter what profession you choose, if you learn another language, in the future it will be a real advantage if you have such skills for your whole life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in the first place among competitors.
According to a survey by YouGov, where more than 4,000 adult British people participated in 2013, 75 percent failed to speak well in a foreign language, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit 15 percent.
That's why the investment in language learning is now important for modern children.
The availability of several languages, especially in developing countries, gives children more opportunities to find good work.
In Scotland every school will be distinguished by the languages taught in it.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will be teaching languages that are most important to Great Britain in view of the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest in, independent schools will always be the choice of several languages with a teacher's composition, which is a specialist in this field.
Scotland's independent schools are trying to ensure an environment of education that will correct children and equip them with the skills needed to achieve success, regardless of what will be in the future.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment languages still have a vital value for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages must be viewed as “the habits of international relations”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and advantage for the youth of Scotland.
This must be done
John Edward, Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
Lebron debuts Sunday in San Diego
The start of waiting for the fans who want to see Lebron James make his first start at Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton reported that James was playing at the pre-season opening Sunday against Denver Naguets in San Diego.
But for as many minutes as he plays, it's still necessary to determine.
"It's going to be more than one and less 48," Waltan said on the Lakers official website.
Correspondent Lakers Mike Trudel wrote that James would probably play in limited minutes.
In line with the practice that happened this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
The time to launch the Thramp in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight in Willing, West Virginia, President Donald Trump starts a lot of company activities.
It's the first of five of Trump's planned talks next week, including bars in friendly places, Tennessee and Mississippi.
When you confirm your vote on your election to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump is trying to strengthen the support for the interim elections, since the Republic risks losing control of Congress when the vote is held in November.
When the tramp performance starts tonight in West Virginia and how to look at it on the Internet?
ET tonnage, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see the Tramp's presentation in West Virginia on the Internet below in the direct direction of YouTube.
Trump, probably all this week, will consider hearings on the candidacy of the Brett Kavano Supreme Court, which has problems with the opportunity of charges in sexual claims with pending confirmation in the Senate of a week's vote during the FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of these speeches is to give help to the Republicans who are facing the election in November.
Thus, President Tramp's campaign announced that these five speeches were directed next week to "activize the activities of volunteers and supporters, as the Republics are trying to defend and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
"Congratulation control is so important for his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible, since we will enter the tense pre-election season," said Reiter, a representative of Trump.
The Wesbanco Arena in Willing, which is planned for the arena, today's action can attract fans from Agao and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pitburg media," reported The West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month, when Trump visited West Virginia, a state where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a candidate in the Senate from West Virginia, Patrick Morris, who is the leader in the questions.
"It's not a very good sign for Morris that the president should come to try to give him a push in questions," said Simon Hedar, a pilot from the University of West Virginia, reported Reuters.
Kubak Rider 2018: U.S. command is being sent to fight to keep hopes of life on Sunday
After three one-way sessions on Saturday's four, perhaps they were exactly what it took for this Cube Reader.
The master of the impulse that seems to be a completely invented sports concept in which a player sincerely believes, and nothing more than a similar partnership.
So where would they say the pulse now?
"They had the advantage of six points, and now four, so I think we're going through this with a little impulse," said Jordan Spyt, walking for the day.
Europe's advantage, of course, is four points forward, and there are twelve more games.
Americans, as Spichus says, feel that they have taken the wind easily, and they have what they expect, not least because of the shape of Spyta and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day, and each can boast three points out of four.
Spate was mortal from football to green and is an example.
These frowning cries of celebration became more louder than any round, and he drowned a decisive blow to play in the match on four fields when they and Thomas had gathered two by two.
His stroke, which allowed them to win the 15th, was met with a similar scream, like that which tells you that he believes the American team is not off.
"You just need to get in and worry about your own match," said Spici.
Each of these players has already gone.
18 holes to make a score.
In the last two days, the only players who have acquired more points than Spyt and Thomas are the French Malinarians and Tommy Flethwood, the unscrupulous story of Cube Rider.
Strange but magical couples in Europe four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Mallowwood" was the only couple who made no gods on Saturdays, on the second half of the day, but they also fled the gods on Saturday mornings, on Fridays and on the second half of the Fridays.
It happens, and like their energy, it flows to this stormy crowd and from it, and it confirms that they are players who win Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to close a potential victory in Europe when the sun rises on Le Golf National, than Flethwood or Malinarians.
It's both wanted at the same time on different holes.
The talk about European glory remains temporary.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson did a short work on Sergei Garcia, a hero of an earlier furthest when he was in a couple with Alex Norren.
The gods and two twins on the previous nine drew the Spanish and the Swedes with which they could not get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will be able to help you with your hole.
After the match four balls and fours it's so interesting to observe carefully because of the interaction between the couple's composition, the advice they give, the advice they don't perform, and how the strategy can be changed in one moment.
Europe has thus far become a better team and has played a significant role in the last days, but this fourth session also shows that the US team is trying to fight, in which some people were suspicious, especially in the States.
Europe comes to the end of the cube of 10-6
Europe will have a good advantage in the last day of Kubka Ryder after it comes out of the four-ball games Saturday and four-man games 10-6 over the United States.
The inspirational duet of Tommy Flethwood and Francesca Mallinaires set up a fight against two victories over Tiger Woods to bring the results to Le Golf National at four points.
The European side of Thomas B'irn, trying to preserve the trophies they lost in Hazeltín two years ago, was in the American agency of unsatisfied in the morning with a 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more resistance to the four matches, winning two matches, but they could not do more.
To keep the trophies, Jim Furick's side needs eight points from 12 single matches on Sunday.
Flethwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row, and he and Malinary, who got the name Molliwood after the sensational exits, is only the second couple, who won four points for their first four matches in the history of Kubeka Ryder.
By smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into four matches, they've been wonderfully fortified to win the fallen Woods and American infantry Breisson Decomb five and four more.
Woods, who was driving himself through two matches on Saturday, showed a random flash, but now he lost 19 out of 29 times in the matches of four balls and fours and seven pairs.
Justin Rose, resting on the x-suits of four swords, returned to partner Henry Stanson in the match of four swords to defeat 2 & 1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koopy--takes one and the other place in the world.
Europe had not had its way, although it was pleasant, fresh day to the south from the west of Paris.
On Saturday, the three-time top winner Jordan Spyt and Justin Thomas set up a checkpoint for Americans by two points.
They won 2 and 1 over John Ram and Ian Pulter from Spain in four matches and came back later to win Puller and Rory McCillroy 4 and 3 in four, losing two holes.
Only twice in the history of Kubka Rider team returned with a deficit of four points that goes alone, although the owners of Furik should only paint to save the traffic.
But after the next two days, which are the best, Sunday's contract looks like if they've got it all.
North Korea says "no way" won't be disbanded in one way or another without trust
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated that on Saturday, the United Nations continues to impose sanctions that increase the US' mistrust, and under such conditions the country cannot refuse nuclear weapons in one way or another.
R. Yun Ho stated to the annual General Assembly of the World Authority that in the past year North Korea had adopted "significant measures of good will", such as the stopping of nuclear and missile testing, the dismantling of nuclear testing zones, and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"At the same time, we don't see the right answer on the US side," he said.
"Without trust to the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way first of all in a unilateral order to disarm ourselves."
Despite the fact that Ri republished the usual North Korean complaints against Washington's "step-by" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea was rewarded because it took steps, his application proved to be significant in that he did not reject the unilateral denuclearization announcement made by Plenary in the past.
Ri withdrew to a joint statement by Kim Chen In and Donald Tramp in his first history as President of the United States and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on the road to the "denuclearization of the Caribbean", while the Tromp promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea is officially trying to end the war in Korea from 1950 to 53 years, but the United States has said that Phanyan must first reject nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to cancel severe international sanctions in relation to North Korea.
"The United States of America first insists on "denuclearization" and increasing pressure levels with sanctions to achieve its goal in a forced way, and even speaking against "the end of the war," says Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can put us on the knees, is the inconceivable dream of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the duration of sanctions deepens our mistrust."
Ri didn't mention the plans at the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the United States chief noted earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korea leader Mun Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the question of denuclearization were South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the South East would not become such a topic."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year's speech when he spoke to the AAN, the General Assembly stated that the focus on the US contingent with the help of the North Korean missile was inevitable after "Mr. President Zla" Trump called Kim "a rocket" suicide.
This year in AAN Trump, who in the past year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, Kim praised for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said that there would still be much to do, and sanctions must remain in force until the North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump reported that he had no time frame for it, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia are fighting in AAN.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey told the AAN Security Council on Thursday that "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must continue actively and compulsorily until we are sure of complete, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council strengthened its sanctions against North Korea in 2006, in an effort to stop funding for the Pchenjan nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompey met with Ri in the Security Council colours. The General Assembly then announced that in the coming months he would visit Phanyan again to prepare for the next summit.
Pompey visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July he left Phanyan, stating that the progress achieved with North Korea over the course of a few hours' speech ended with a statement of visa, which he proposed requirements of "like the gangsters."
At the meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has vowed to eliminate the missile installation and the nuclear complex if the United States takes appropriate measures.
Trump said that Kim's "appropriate measures", which he expects, is a guarantee of security and an incentive for normalization of relations with Washington, which Trump promised in Singapore.
Harvard students are taking a course in good rest.
The new Harvard University course this year should teach students more sleep, and it's my goal to compete with culture to learn from coffee at night.
The scientist came to the conclusion that students in one of the best universities in the world often don't know how to care properly for themselves and their health.
Charles Chasler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist hospital named Brigam and a woman's hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first in his country in the United States.
The inspired discourse about the influence of a sleepless sleep on learning began a course.
At the end of the lecture, one girl came to me and said, "Why did they tell me just now, at the last course of teaching?"
"She said that nobody and never talked to her about the importance of sleep – it surprised me," he said The Telegraph.
For the first time in this year, the course taught by the student explains why good sleep habits promote academic and sporting achievement and also improve the general mood.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the health care department at the University, said that the university decided to take the course after finding out that students were often sleep free for a week.
A course that takes an hour is a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a room on the Internet, where students click on a cup of coffee, aprons and books that tell about the effects of caffeine and light and how a lack of sleep affects sports indicators, and also the importance of a habit before sleep.
At a later stage, the participant tells how a multi-year break-in of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The compass map, with interactive images, invites participants to think about their everyday life.
"We know it's not going to change the student's behavior for a moment.
But we think they have to know it as well as everyone knows about the consequences of smoking for health," added Professor Chesler.
According to his words, the culture of the evening dinners still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students will lead to a more and more troublesome sleep.
"A sufficient sleep of good quality must be a "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety," he said, "even to avoid a lower weight, since the release of the sleep makes the brain permanently hungry."
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler develop the course.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to train everyone on the campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all the graduates to complete a similar teaching program before going to university.
Professor Chesler recommended that students set up an hour to know when to go to sleep and when to wake up, aware of the harmful effects of the blue light coming from the screens of the monitors and light-emitting lights that can change the contemporary mode, leading to the problem of sleep.
"Liveingstan" 1:0 "Randers," "Minga is killing Gerard's goal."
Rangers suffered another time when Dolly Mangy's goal convinced Stephen Jarard that he won't get a 1-0 shot at the Lioningstan Stadium.
Ibrax wants to record his first victory on the way to a 4-1 victory in February in St. John's, but Harry Holton's team is already taking the second time as Gerard's 18-game manager to leave eight points on their side, leaving the leaders of the first-generation Ladbrokes Hearts.
Manga hit seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers team, inspired by his head, didn't look like he was suffering right away.
At the same time that Rangers fall to 6th place, Lvivington got to third place, and behind them are the Hibernians with a gap in balls.
For Rangers there may be additional problems after how forward Colum Spence should be treated from the trauma of his head after the subject was thrown out of the Tribune.
Gerard made eight changes of players, so that Ira didn't play at the semifinal of Kubque Betfred.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Levi under 11 rooms, which allowed him to pick up a point from Hearts last week, and was in awe of how well they had walked each step of their opponents.
"Randers" better owned the ball, but Livigstan made more attempts to kill the ball.
They had to be killed in two minutes, when the first Mangy directed the ball through Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's gates, and then the half-breeder used this chance.
The successful criminal blow of Jacob's Keegan took up Craig Halket's surprise, but his partner for the defense of Alan Litgo could put a strong blow behind him.
Rangers took control, but in the last quarter of the game, they were more likely to kill than they were showing a good game.
Alfred Morelas certainly had to be punished for a quarter of an hour before the end when he and Stephen Loveless met in the field, but Judge Stephen Thompson did not take Colombia's complaints.
Rangers managed to hit the gate only in the first half of the game, but there were the brats of Ibrax Liam Kelly who almost gave the goal to Lasan Kulibali and the effective attack of this Healy.
Although killing the first goal at the 34th minute of Levi, it may have been against the next active game, but no one denies that they have to demonstrate to the spectators a good game.
And the Rangers couldn't try Jacob's gate again.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher gave a passport to Scott Robinson, who blocked Manga to get the chance to kill in the gate.
Gerard replaced Kulibali's stop at Ryan Kent, and it showed an effective impact when he attacked Marelas, but the impressive Kelly ran away and locked up the impact.
But "Livingstan" continued to please visitors, playing this game, which they liked, and the Litgos and Halket continued to share the ball after a long struggle.
The side of Holt could only prevail for the last few minutes, but McGregor was playing well to resist Jacobs before how the Litgs had gone to the backdrop of the spare.
The replacement of Rangers Glen Midleton took place in turn after the penalty was fined when he met Jacobs, but tomsan managed to get away.
Almanac: Geiger's inventor.
A page from our Almanac Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and PADLICI... the day of future physicist Iagan Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactive activity, which resulted in the emergence of a device known as the Geiger numerator.
Geiger's numbering became part of science and appeared in pop culture, as in the 1950 movie "Called Karadánd", where they would seem to have been the smallst scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: Who is he on earth?
Rogers: "It's the Geiger counter that's used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you're putting on the earphones, you're really able to hear the sounds of atoms that are radioactive in the minerals."
Evans: "Say it's really disturbing now?"!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before 63 years of birth.
But the inventions that bear his name continue to be used.
A new progressive vaccine can help the immune system to see cancer cells.
A new anticancer vaccine can help the immune system see bad cells and destroy them.
The vaccine, however, teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, which will be part of the treatment.
The method predicts getting immune cells from the patient and changing them into the lab.
Then the cells can "see" the cells, which are distributed into many cancer cells, and then reintroduce the other cells.
The test vaccine shows successful results for patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who was introduced to a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize cancer cells has seen the cancer of the ovaries disappear for 18 months.
The method includes getting immune cells in the patient, changing them in the lab so that they can "see" HER2 proteins, common to many cancer cells, and then being introduced again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Betesse, Maryland, said that our results show that there is a very promising vaccine.
"HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of antibodies that compete with the cancer of small bees, eggs, light and thick cats," said Professor Berazofski.
Similar approaches to the detection of immune cells in patients and the "learning" of cancer cells have worked well when treating cancer.
The West Cane has started a discussion in support of the Trump, bearing the title MAGA, after his appearance in the SNL.
That didn't turn out well.
In a study on Saturday evening, Kanye West was despised after the speech he was making in the United States. President Donald Trump announced that he would fight for the second term in 2020.
After performing the evening of his third song, called "The City of Privy", when he was in the chapter "Make America a Big Again", he spoke against the Democrats and confirmed his support for Trump.
"How many times do I talk to the whites, and they say, 'How can you support the Trump, he's a racist?'
"Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have long left America," he said.
The SNL started a show with Matt Diamond's main role, where the Hollywood star was able to record Bret Cavano's statements before the Senate's court committee when considering the case of the sexual violence of Christian Blaise Ford.
Despite the fact that the speech was not broadcast, the words of West Papali were framed and were loaded into social media comics by Chris Year.
Didn't understand if you tried to thank Rock from West.
Besides, West complained to the audience that he had a hard time behind the scenes.
They thanked me for the bullets.
They said, “Do not come out of this pit.
They thanked me.
"And then they say I'm in the middle of nowhere," he said, as the Washington Examiner reports.
The West continued: "Do you want to see the giblah?" "Saying that he is going to put on my Sperman hat, which means he can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
Try to love.
Because of his statements, at least two times the SNS heard, and the SNS members were confused with Veraita's message.
The West was taken as replacement of the singer of the Ariana Grande, whose had been a boy, rapper Macmiller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many by playing song I Love It, dressed in a water bottle Perrier.
West received support from the maintenance manager of TPUSA, Kendes Turner, who wrote on the Twitter: "One of the bravest spirits Thank you for your support."
But driving a show-off Karen Hunter wrote that the West was just who he was, and it was always wonderful.
"But I have decided not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothing, or by supporting his "artivity," which I think is a fascinating and distorted ideology that is harmful to my spouse.
He's free.
And so do we," she added.
Before the show rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, saying that he now "is officially called Kane West."
He was not the first artist to change his name, and went after Grandpa, also known as Puff Grandpa.
His colleague's reperper Snoop Dogg was called the quality Snoop Lion and, of course, the legend of music, which changed his name to a symbol, and then he and the artist earlier known as a prince.
Trying to kill Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of trying to kill after a restaurant in the eastern part of Belfast fell on the second man on Friday.
The instinct happened in Balihakamore, as the police report.
It is expected that the accused will appear on Monday at Belfast's court.
The charges will be considered by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harrington's Yellow Throne caught up with the idealized brutality.
Kit Harrington is known for his daring sword and the role of John Snow in the series "Guilty Stands" in the Middle Ages of the HBO
But the 31-year-old actor got a stereotype of a hero sword, which means that young boys often feel harder to respect.
Speaking at the Sunday Times Culture Department, Keith said he thought "something happened" and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the #MeToo era.
Kitt, who recently married his neighbor on the Yellow Thrones, Rose Leslie, who was also 31 years old, admitted that she felt the power to solve this problem.
"Do I feel myself a strong guy -- when we were wrong with courage?" he said.
"Why do we teach men when they grow up from a point of view that we see now?"
The whale thinks that television must be responsible for the emergence of brutality from very male characters.
He continued: "What lies at the beginning and why is it taught?
Why teach on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they must be so sure to be a real man?
I think it's really one of the biggest issues in our time -- how do we change it?
Because it's obvious what's happening to young people.
In an interview, he also admitted that the next summer the series would end, and he would come out of the field of battle the series and would not do any doxels or bicycles to the Free Thrones.
From November Kitt will begin to rebirth the True Western Sam Shepherd, who is a historical director with his brother, who is a slave.
A recent actor told me that she thought meeting with Rose's wife was the best opportunity to end the "Trafficking Thrones".
"I met my wife in this show, so I got my future family, and my life here," he said.
The rose was played by Ygritte, a character in which the hero Keith John Snow was in love with this fantastic series entitled "Emi".
The couple won in June 2018 in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS increased by 14%.
According to data from health professionals, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
Only around 40,000 new cases were registered in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, as was the case in the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection spreads in some areas of China as a result of blood transfusion.
"At once the number of people infected with HIV-infection through blood transfusions has declined almost to zero," said the Chinese newspaper at a conference in the Union.
Yet, each year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China grows by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV infection through sex is a major problem for the Chinese LGBT-supplore.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination in relation to LGBT people has been so far.
Because of the conservative value in the country, about 70-90% of men who engage in sex with men eventually marry women.
Many diseases are spread out of insufficient knowledge and sexual contraception.
Since 2003, the Government of China has been providing universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address this global problem.
Maxine Waters rejects tears of joy, danger and conspiracy theory by her colleagues in Parliament
The U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters dropped the charge on Saturday that her associate posted personal information about the three US senators on Wikipedia's page.
Democrats of Los Angeles claimed that the claims were made to the participants of the top right wing and their websites.
"A lie, a lie, and a lot of disgusting lies," says the Waters statement on Twitter.
The published information, as reported, includes home addresses and phone numbers in the United States.
The information placed by an unknown man on the Capital Hill during the hearing of the Senate's commission on sexual charges against a member of the Bret Cavana Warfare was published on the Internet on Thursday.
The escape took place some time after the three senators questioned Cavano.
"Conservative sites, such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, report that the IP address of the sources was linked to the Waters office and provided information to the Waters team," Hell reported.
"This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and absolutely false," the Waters continued.
"A member of my team whose data, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these suspicious and false charges, at any rate he did not respond to the leak of this information.
This unwarranted assertion is completely false and absolutely false."
Waters' statement quickly called for criticism on the Internet, including from the former press secretary of the White House of Ari Flasher.
"It's a rejection of anger," Flesher wrote.
It's to prove that she doesn't have the courage to be members of Congress.
If anyone accuses them of not doing, they should not be caught.
They must not lead themselves absurdly.
They must not question the cause of their accusation.
They must be calm and kind.
Flasher compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of the democrats to Judge Cavano, when they were accused of being too angry during the hearings on Thursday.
Amar Navara, a candidate from the Republican Party, who is involved in intermediate elections, also appeared on Twitter.
"It's a resonance when the truth turns out," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters stated that her office had warned the relevant authorities and legal authorities about these false statements.
"We guarantee that the guilty will be found," she continued, "and they bear the legal responsibility for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to any of my team's employees."
A review of Johnny English Strikes Again brings a blow to Rowen Atkinsan's invented spy.
Now it's a tradition to look for the meaning of BREXITU in any new film with a British cover, and it seems to be in a comedy and ex-French, Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and lasted in 2011 called Johnny English.
Will the satire be able to express itself well in terms of how obvious we look when we talk about the new export opportunities?
In any case, the second time he appeared in print, the unqualified Johnny English got the opportunity to laugh at things--his name was louder than any comical figures he made for non-English viewers in cinematography.
Of course, he's a secret agent, who, despite his wisest claim to glamour, got a little like Clouseau with Mr. Bin's drawings and a little like that guy who brought a single note to Hor fire at the ceremony of opening the Olympics in London in 2012.
Originally his character was based on the wanderers and international mysteries of Atkinsan, who used to play in the forgotten Barclaycard, leaving chaos on his way.
Here are a few pleasant moments that were not before.
I loved Johnny English, who was approaching the helicopter, dressed in the middle of the day's success, and the paws of a duck bit piling up on his helmet.
Atkinsan's theatrical comedy shows the light, but the humour feels weak, and so it's amazing when serious movies, such as Agent 007: Mission Unimplementable, are definitely offering comedy as a major part.
The humour feels as if it were not only for adults, but also for children, and even the foolish accidents of Johnny English isn't as inventive as the silent films of Atkinsan in Bina's person.
A number of years of current thinking are serious problems in Great Britain.
A cyber hacker penetrates into a super-secret community of British spies in Great Britain, opening the names of all British agents on the ground, to the disappointment of a state agent -- unfortunately, the small role of Kevin Eldan.
This is the last point for Prime Minister, which is a proud and mixed act that is already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible with this Quasi-Terezai-May, but there is nothing in the script.
Her research consultants report that since every real spy will be discovered, she will have to activate one of those who are already retired.
And that means that for Johnny English itself it's getting complicated: now he works as a sixth teacher in a number of chess institutions and teaches how to be an unprincipled operator: some good examples here, because English offers the Academy of Spinach Music lessons.
English returned to Whitehall for an extraordinary briefing and joined his former multi-year friend Bo, who is playing Ben Miller again.
At present 'cause my marriage is tied to the commandant of the submarine, whose role Vicky Pepperdin was a bit empty.
Thus Batman and Robin get awfully wrong things in the secret agency of the Queen, where they're working again, meeting the beautiful woman Volga Curylene.
Meanwhile, the prime minister receives a dangerous command from a charismatic technical billionaire who claims that he can solve problems with the hackers of the United Kingdom: with the captivating Jason Walt, who plays Jake Lacey.
English and Bow start their esophagus from immediate things: mask under the officer, burn the French restaurant; create a feast, fight the smugglers on the edge of the luxury boat of Volta; English makes a clean anarchy, because he tries to use the art of virtual reality to meet the interior of Walt's house.
All the moments taken for the last event, but equally pleasant and noisy, in which there are quite a lot of kids on TV.
Pretty good stuff.
And how with other movies about Johnny English I couldn't think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinsan the role that really demonstrates his talent?
The Liberian Party rejects that a plan is being developed to pay the British for a four-week work week with a five-day salary.
Jeremy Corbin's job party must consider a radical plan when the British only work four days a week, but pay them for five.
It is reported that the party wants entrepreneurship managers to deliver the results of the work done as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence, giving them an extra day off.
It was clear that the employees would get pleasure from the three-day exits, but they would still get the same reward.
The source indicates that the idea corresponds to the party's economic program and plans to direct the country to support workers.
The trade union has approved a four-week transition as a good way to use change in the economy.
The oldest source in the Liberian party told The Sunday Times: "The planned review of actions will be announced by the end of the year.
It's not going to happen right now, but the four-week work week is an idea that matches the party's view and the overall industrial strategy of regulating the economy for the benefit of workers.
The Liberian Party is not the first to approve such an idea, the Green Party promises to carry out a four-week work week during the 2017 general selection of the company.
However, the efforts of the Liberian party in general are not supported.
A representative of the Liberian Party said, "The four-week working week is not a party policy, and it is not a party.
Chancellor John McDonnell used a work conference last week to express his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said that he had decided to return the power from the non-violent directors and managers in the community.
The plans of the shadow office also provide that the current water resources shareholder may not get back the entire package of shares, as the Government of Liberia may make a "account" on the basis of the alleged violations.
He also confirmed that he was planning to bring workers into company councils and create joint property funds to hand over 10 percent of the private company's own funds to employees who would hold annual dividends up to 500 pounds of sterling.
Lindsey Grem, John Kennedy's release for "60 minutes," that the FBI that works with Cavano has to change its opinion.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Cavano has put a final vote on his election to the Supreme Court at least a week.
In an interview on Sunday, Scotland's 60-minute correspondent, Scott Pauly asked the Republicans Johnny Kennedy and Lindsey Greham about "Sense," whether the FBI could reveal everything that could lead to change.
Kennedy turned out to be more open than his colleague from the South Queen.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said, going to the courthouse: I spoke to Judge Cavano.
I called him after it happened, and I asked him why the charge was made, and I said, "You did it?"
He was decisive and unique."
The Grem's vote, however, seems final.
"I think Bret Cavano has decided that it will be a scandalous accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly rejects it," added Grem, referring to Christina Blaise Ford.
"And all she called could not believe it.
She's only 36 years old.
I don't see anything new."
What is the International Citizens' Festival, and what has been done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York, the International Festival is held: an annual musical event that has a very impressive composition of speakers and performers and a mission to end poverty in the world.
Now, over the course of seven years, the World Citizen's Festival will be held on a large bench of the Central Park, where tens of thousands of people come to enjoy Jeanette Jackson, Cardy B and Sean Mendes's concert, and learn about the real goal of mercapability, which is to stop poverty and get married by 2030.
The 2012 International Publicity Festival is a continuation of the Global Project against an international propaganda group that hopes to stop poverty at the expense of increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for merriment (if you don't want to pay a VIP ticket), visitors had to do a series of tasks or "just right action" to be a walnut, write an e-mail to the country's leader, call any other person and raise awareness of the purpose of stopping poverty.
But how successful was the Civil Festival for 12 years and was it able to achieve its goal?
Is it an idea to reward people with a free concert in a real way to convince people of the need for active action, or is it just another case of so-called "climbism" -- people feel that they're doing the right thing by signing online petition or sending tweets?
Since 2011, festival organizers have reported that more than 19 million "actions" have been recorded from their supporters, who seek to achieve different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to drive influential leaders to carry out their obligations on account of more than $37 billion, which can affect life more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group made 390 comments on liabilities and made at least $10 billion, which had already been allocated or collected.
According to the group's estimates, the resources provided so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key responsibilities include providing food, partnering with investors and performers based in Great Britain, "helping children to develop in full volume", a promise to provide Rwanda $35 million to help prevent malnutrition in the country after obtaining more than 4700 tweets from citizens.
"In support of the government of Great Britain, donors, national governments and citizens of different countries, we can deal with social injustices in history," Ambassador Tracy Ulman of London said in April 2018.
In addition, the group reported that, after more than 5,000 actions were carried out in Great Britain to improve food for furniture and children, the government announced funding for the food aid project to reach 5 million women and children with food problems.
In answer to one of the common questions on the website, "What makes you think we can end poverty?"
The Global Festival answered, "This will be a long and difficult path, sometimes we will endure at once and right."
But like the great civil rights and movements against apartheid, we're going to be successful, because together we're stronger.
Janet Jackson, Wickend, Sean Mendes, Cardie B, Janelle Monae, is one of the number of individuals who are in attendance this year in New York, who will lead Debara-Li Ferns and Hu Jackman.
US can use VMS for blockage to prevent exports of racial oil and gas
"Washington may, if necessary, turn to a naval fleet to prevent the entry of racial energy into the EU and the Middle East," said US Secretary Ryan Zink, Washington Examiner.
Zink argued that Russia's actions in Syria, in particular, where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government, are the basis for a study of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason for their stay in the Middle East is that they want to acquire energy just as much as in Eastern Europe and South Europe," he said.
And, according to the historian, there are ways and means of dealing with this.
"The United States has the ability to ensure the openness of the maritime waterways by the military fleet, and, if necessary, to organize the blockade so that their energy is not likely to hit the market," he said.
The dog addressed the members of the merriment organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-commercial group that position itself as the "voice of energy users" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they were essentially equal.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more balanced and replaces fuel," he said, calling Russia "a side-by-side country" with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These applications were made at a time when the Trump administration wanted to significantly increase the export of its suspicious natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much more expensive option for European consumers.
For this purpose, employees of the Trump Administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to exit the "incorrect" project of the Northern Stream 2 newspaper, which, according to the Trump, has turned Berlin into a "failing" Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 newspaper cost 11 billion dollars, which is created to double the power of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to this project is starting in the economy and is an example of inconclusive competition.
"I think that we have a single view of that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers," said Russia Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting the US Energy Minister at the Price of Perry in Moscow.
The Americans received a hit in response from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industry organization, the Federation of German Developers (BDI), has called for the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Developers (BDI) after a recent meeting between the Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel and the President of Russia Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is going to have a very serious discussion of her participation in the 2020 presidential election, says Senator from Massachusetts
Senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that it would be serious to consider his participation in the presidential election after the interim election.
During a conversation in the Halioke Mary, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the possibility of his participation.
"The time has come for women to be headed to Washington and to order our hostile government, and I'm also talking about women on the highest seats," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will take it very seriously to consider the possibility of fighting in the presidents."
During a speech in Mary Warren, he turned against President Donald Trump, saying that he would "lead the country in the wrong direction".
"I am extremely concerned about what Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his candidacy at the Brett Cavan High Court.
On Friday in his tweet, Warren wrote, "Of course, before voting, it is necessary for the FBI to conduct an investigation."
However, the results of the questionnaire published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not believe that it should meet with presidents in 2020.
According to a poll conducted at the University of Safalk/Bostan Globe, 50 percent of the "possible" voters of Massachusetts said the senator should not get involved.
Thirty-two percent support her decision.
The question has shown much support for former Governor Devil Patrick, where 38 percent were for, and 48 percent against.
Other well-known names among the democracies that were discussed in connection with the potential battle in 2020 include former vice-president Joe Byden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press Bayden, he officially made a decision until November.
As a result of Donald Trump Sara Polin's post-traumatic syndrome, Trek Polin's syndrome was mentioned.
The 26-year-old Track Polin spent a year in Iraq following the call for service in October.
On Monday evening he was arrested and he was charged with domestic violence
"What my son is going through after his return, I can compare with the results of the nutritional syndrome and the wounds that our soldiers are returning to other families," she said to go out in support of Donald Trump in Tals, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest a "bad question" and stated that her son and other war veterans "returning a little to others, being shaken, returning with the question, whether there is the respect for which the soldiers, refugees, other warriors have fought, giving themselves to the country."
He was arrested on Monday at Vasil, Alaska, and he was charged with domestic violence against women, preventing attempts to report domestic violence, armed robbery in a drunken state, according to information from Dan Bennet, a press secretary of the Police Department of Vasil.
18 states and District of Colombia support the development of a new port policy
Eighteen states and the Columbian District support a new U.S. policy, which refuses to use pressure from gangs or domestic violence on the dock.
The representatives of the 18 states and districts of Colombia dropped an analytical note in Washington on Friday to support the assessment of port delivery policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the case of Grace against Sess, which was opened in October by the American Union on civil rights against federal policy, was not revealed.
She claimed that her partner "and his friends with a hard gang" raped her, but on 20 July the US authorities refused to join the camp.
She was detained in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Greece have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, with the largest number of requests for ports in the United States, as countries with serious gang and domestic violence.
The new American port policy has changed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Commission, which has allowed immigrants without documents that are victims of domestic violence to appeal to the port.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Carl Reesein, said on Friday, that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, country and world experience".
“Federal leadership requires the application of the port to be based on concrete facts and circumstances of the case, and such a change violates this principle,” says the analytical note.
The lawyers also stated in a note that the policy that refuses immigrants is making the US economy worse, saying that immigrants can often become entrepreneurs and "make the necessary jobs".
Attorney General Jeff Seshens ordered judges in June on immigration to no longer give the docking victim of domestic violence and gang violence.
"The case is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or political views," Seshnes said on 11 June, reporting on this policy.
The port never meant a solution to the problem, even all the serious problems people face around the world every day.
The desperate rescue work in Paul. During the attempt to find those who survived, the number of missing ones has doubled
Those who survived are in a very difficult situation.
“It’s all very tense,” says a 35-year-old mother of Russ Kusum, peaceing her little son with a temperature in the evacuation center of the ruined town of Palo.
"Every minute the car 'quick' brings the body.
Pure water is very little."
The lodgers began to return to their ruined houses, picking up the wet things, trying to save everything that could be found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitalized, damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 balls, were overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including the number Two Harris, who broke the caller and his shoulder, are outside the Palo army hospital, where patients are being treated on the street because of the strong syringes that are repeated.
His eyes showed tears when he remembered the feeling of strong underground pushes in the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to fight.
I was pushed under the ruins of the wall," said Harris Associated Press, and added that his family had come to the city for marriage.
"I heard her call for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador blames China for "threats" using "propagandist advertising"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper printed a four-sided advertisement in the American daily, praising the mutual benefits of American-Chinese trade, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread the propaganda.
The US President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned a pay addendum to China Daily at Des Moines Register, the most widely sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after China's prosecution in an attempt to get involved in the election in the American Congress on November 6th.
The accusation that China tried to get involved in the American elections meant that American officials were calling for a new phase in the conversation with Reuters in Washington under pressure on China.
Although the placement of advertising by foreign governments is a normal practice to promote trade, now Beijing and Washington have launched a trade war, which has resulted in the reciprocal imposition of import tariffs.
Repressive tariffs, according to American and Chinese experts, were introduced to harm such an exporter as the contractors of the state of Iowa, who support the Republic of Trump.
Teri Brandt, the US Ambassador to China and the governor of Iowa, the main exporter of the domestic agricultural goods in China, said that Beijing had been injured by American workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, Branstad wrote in a Sunday article in Des Moines Register, "now double its efforts by printing propaganda in our free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a good American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, printing a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register," Brandt wrote.
"And if you look at the paper bags in Beijing, there you will find not so many voices against and you will not see the real display of other opinions that Chinese might have against a dangerous trajectory in the economy, taking into account the fact that the press is under the iron fifth Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers refused to offer," to print his article, although he did not even call it a newspaper.
Republicans repel female pickers from the past fiscal choices Cavano, warning analysts
While many well-known republics are defending a candidate for the possession of Supreme Judge Brett Cavano in front of several charges in sexual violence, analysts warned that they would get hit in response, especially from women, during future interim elections.
The emotions around it were very strong, and most of the Republicans already showed that they were ready to vote.
"These things can't be returned any more," said Grant Richoir, professor of political science at Maxwell Syracuse University of The Hill for the article, which was printed on Saturday.
The speaker said that he was not sure that Senator Jeff Fleigh (Arison)'s statements on the FBI's investigation would be enough to calm down the angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday -- they won't forget it tomorrow and in November," said Karen Jean-Pier, chief advisor and national press secretary of the MoveOn Progression Group from Washington, D.C., on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protesters staged the Fall Quick! during a demonstration at the Senate Hall, when the Republicans who control the legal committee decided to remove the Cavano candidacy, despite the statement by Dr. Christian Blaise Ford, according to Mic.
"Democrat enthusiasm and motivation will be extremely great," said an independent political analyst at Stu Rottenberg's news site.
"People say they're already tall, and that's true.
But they can be even higher, especially among women electors in the suburbs and young electors from 18 to 29 years old, who don't even like the president, but often don't vote."
Even before the open Ford's statement, in which she detailed her charges of a felony in the Criminal Court in sexual violence, analysts believe that if Republicans will insist on confirmations, there may be a strong blow in response.
"For the Republican Party, this has been a mixed one," said Michael Stett, who was the head of the National Republican Party Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"The talk is not about the vote of the committee or about the final vote, or about whether the Cavano will be held on the property. It is about how the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have dealt with it," notes the new Hai Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps choose the Democrats.
However, it's like the Americans were divided into Ford's or Cavano's rights, with a little more talk than the last one.
A new question from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents are sure or not very sure to trust Ford's statement, and 35 percent said that they are sure or not very sure about Cavana.
In addition to this 38 percent said that, according to their opinion, Cavano may or may have failed in his statement, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After a flake on the side of the FBI, he investigates the charges on the side of Ford and, at least, another person, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford made an oath before the Senate's Legal Committee that Cavano, when he was drunk, demanded it at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate at the Supreme Court showed her her genitals at the evening when they were studying in Eile in 1980.
World Wide Web Founder plans to start a New Internet to create Google and Facebook competitions
This Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world network, launches a startup that will become a Facebook, Amazon and Google competitor.
The latest project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company built on the open Berners-Li Solid platform.
Solid allows the user to choose where to store the data and who has access to this information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Li, he said that, creating the Inrupt, he meant "the feeling of the world."
"You have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
This program uses Solid to allow people to create their own Internet storage or POD.
This can include a list of contacts, mailing lists, calendar, fanatics and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available all at once on one browser simultaneously.
The uniqueness of the personal data storage on the Internet is that only the user determines who has access to the information.
The company calls it "personally strengthening the potential by means of data."
According to the executive director, John Bruce's idea of creating Inrupt allows companies to communicate together resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is now made up of Berners-Li, Bruce, security platforms purchased by IBM, a number of developers working on a contract project and a colliery.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised programs using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Brenners-Li said that he and his team didn't talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make any changes if all their business models were reviewed instantly.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a Saturday publication on Medium Berners-Li, he wrote that the Inrupt mission "is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem for the protection of integrity and the quality of the new solid network."
In 1994, Berners-Li transformed the Internet into a Consortium of the World Network at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been very influential in terms of network neutrality.
Even starting Inrupt, Berners-Li will remain the founders and directors of the Consortium of the World Network, the Network Fund and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the new era," said Berners-Li.
Bernard Van: honoring a clergyman crowned by the Victorian Cross in the First World War
The only Anglican church pastor, crowned by the Victorian Cross during the First World War as a combatant, was marked in his town 100 years later.
Colonel Bernard Van was awarded a position on 29 September 1918 as a member of the Belenglaz and Leakur.
However, four days later he died of a sniper bullet and never learned that he had received the highest military award in Britain.
On Saturday in the town of Rushden, the county of Nartgemptonshire, two of his grandsons on the parade opened a monumental stone.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "very symbolic", that the stone was opened about 100 years after his grandfather was reborn.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Van took his battalion through the San Quentin Canal "through a dense corner and under a strong pink and clumsy fire."
Then he ran on the line of fire and "with great boldness" led the soldier forward, grasping the magnet himself and selecting three divisions.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, and a little more than a month later, the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Van said that his grandfather's actions were "something I could never do and something worth respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also set up a win after the council, which appointed the Imperial Young Archbishop of Brandwood.
Michael Van said that "for his great pride to take part in the parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero was demonstrated by the support shown by many."
MMA fans waited all night to see Bellator 206, they instead got Pep's pig
Just imagine, you've stayed all night to see the packed transmission from Bellator 206, and then you're denied the main event.
The San-Has program had 13 battles, including six on the main card, and they showed up in the direct effigy all night on the British Channel 5.
And in the sixth morning, when Gerar Musasi and Rory McDonald were getting ready, looking into the Great Britain they were just joking when the program changed into Pep's pork.
Some were disappointed after having spent an insanity night, especially waiting for this fight.
One of the Bolsheviks on Twitter called the switch to a child's cartoon as "some crazy joke."
In answer to the question of broadcasting Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president Bellator on marketing and communication, he said, "The state order agreed and 6 mornings this content was inappropriate and had to be turned into a child's program."
"Yes, "Swinka Pepa."
The president of Bellator Scott Kocker said that in the future they would work on the program to count British observers.
"I think we're considering the possibility of a repeat, in my opinion, that we can resolve this issue," said Koker.
"But now the sixth morning of Sunday, and we can't resolve it by Sunday by our time, and it's Monday by their time.
But we're doing everything possible.
Believe me, when the programs changed, we got a lot of messages and not all of them were friendly.
We've tried to solve the question, considering it's a technical error.
But it turned out to be a state order.
I can tell you that the next time it happened, it didn't happen.
We're going to lower the number of screws from six to five, as we do it usually, this time we wanted to advise fans, but we're getting old.
It's an extreme situation."
"Discs of the Inhuman Island": Tom Dale felt "small" because of sexuality
The Olympic example of jumping in Tom Dale's water said that growing with a sense of insignificance for others because of their sexuality -- but it gave him motivation on the way to success.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't understand that "not all is like me," until he went to high school.
Speaking on Radio 4's "Discs of the Inhuman Island", led by Lauren Lavern, he said he supported the gay right to give other "hope".
He also stated that when he had a child, he began to think less of winning the Olympics.
The traditional leader of this pretty old program, Kirsti Yang, took rest for a few months because of the disease.
In the role of a man who found himself on a non-human island, in Lavern's first program, Dale said that in his childhood he felt "less" than everyone else, because "the society didn't take those who loved both boys and girls."
He said, "I now think that this feeling that you're not like everything or nothing was what gave me strength and inspiration for success."
He wanted to prove that there was a "someone," he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint those who knew about his sexuality.
A double bronze example of the Olympics has become a major LGBT movement activist and at the Australian Society Games this year called on countries not to criminalise homosexuals.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was fortunate to live openly without persecution and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man -- an American script, director and president of Dustin Lance Blake, who met in 2013 -- "it was unexpected for me."
Dale married the owner of Oscar, who was 20 years older than him last year, but, according to him, the difference in age doesn't matter.
"If you're going through this in such a young age," he said, "it was hard to find a rabbi who would survive such an ups and downs.
In June they became parents, their son called Robert Ray Black-Dale, and Dale said that his "perspective entirely" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that I need to win the gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are things in the world that are more important than the gold of the Olympic medal.
Robbie, this is my golden Olympic medal."
His son is also called his father Robert. His father died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Dale said that his father didn't accept the fact that he died and one of the last things he asked about was whether they bought tickets at the 2012 London Olympics – he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you won't sit in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he was not immortal," he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – jumping in water in front of my ballers in the Alpine games, it’s the best feeling,” he said.
It also influenced the choice of song -- the Proud of Hizer Small -- which found a guide in it in preparation for the Olympics and from which the ants are now running.
"Discs of the Inhuman Island" can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 in British summer time.
Mikelson, who is not in shape, stays on the bench of the spare in Ryder's cup on Saturday
American Phil Michelson will put a record on Sunday, playing 47 matches in the Rider's cube, but he needs to return the form so that this event doesn't get unlucky.
Michelson, who's going to play in this co-operation, which takes place once every two years, the 12th record, the captain of the team, Jim Furyk, has been sitting on the bench for the Saturday night.
Instead of being in the center of events, and he was there often for the United States team, the five-time Cup winner divided his days between the work of the cleaner and the coaches, hoping to get back in shape.
Even at the peak of his career he wasn't the best player, and now a 48-year-old golfer is not the ideal choice for an uneasy Le Golf National field, where there are severe beatings.
And if the field itself is not dark enough, Mikelson in the ninth match on Sunday will fight against an accurate British Open French Malians champion who won all four matches this week along with Tommy Flethwood.
If Americans who stay at four points at the beginning of the 12 single match start off with success, the Michelson match can prove extremely important.
Fury expressed confidence in this player, but there was nothing more he could say.
"He fully understood his role today, slapped me on my back, hugged me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Furick.
"He is very confident in himself.
He was taken to the Hall of Glory and gave a very many command in the past and this week.
Maybe I didn't plan it on two matches.
I was planning more, but I was working just like that and so we were thinking about playing.
He wants to be in the field, as well as everyone else."
Mikelson will beat the record of Nick Fald by the number of matches in the Rider's cup played on Sunday.
It could be the end of a career in Ryder's cube, which was never the same as achievements in individual games.
In Mikelson, 18 winners, 20 losers and seven-and-a-half, although Furyk said his presence brought benefits to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, with humor, he likes to joke about people and he's just a very good man who's good at the team," he explained.
"I think that the younger players with the pleasure of parading his jokes, too, this week, and it was good to see.
He gives command much more than just a game."
The Captain of the European Command Thomas B'ern knows that a big cut could soon disappear
Thomas Burne, the captain of the European team, knows from the experience that a significant break before the individual games last day on the Rider's cube, may easily disappear.
A Dutch debuter in the 1997 game in Valderam, where a European team under the direction of Seva Balesterras had the advantage of five points over the Americans, but ended with a minimum advantage of 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
"You always remind yourself that in Valder, we had a great advantage and won, but with difficulty, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where they lost," B'ern said after viewing how the Class of 2018 had won 5-3 and Friday, and yesterday, and counted 10-6 on Le Golf National.
"History shows me and everyone else in the team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow you have to play at all of the hundred.
Go out in the field and do everything right.
Until the points appear in the table, nothing's finished.
We have a goal, and this is an attempt to win this fight, and that's what we're going to focus on.
I say this all the time, I focus on 12 players on our side, but we understand very well that on the opposite side there are the best players in the world."
Satisfied by how his players played on the hard field for golf, B'ern added, "I will never consider myself in this.
Tomorrow will be a completely different game.
It's going to be individual games tomorrow, and it's going to be quite different.
It's just great if you're in a field with a partner and everything's going well, but if you're playing one, here's where your real golfer talents are verified.
That's what you need to tell the players that they have to show tomorrow the best.
Now you have to leave your partner, you have to go home, and you have to show the best as an individual player."
Unlike B'arna, his rival Jim Furick expects the best individual game of his sportsmen than the one they demonstrated in partnership, except for Jordan Spyt and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
Furik himself was on both sides of these matches the last day, playing in a winning team in Brooklyn and losing when Europe had a "Wood in Medina."
"I remember every word of it," he said, answering the question as Ben Crencho, the captain of 1999 set up his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we always want to have a quick start that you saw in Brooklyn and in Medina.
As the speed increases, the greatest pressure is on those who play the ball in the middle.
We set up a proper schedule and put the players in the way we liked it, and tomorrow we're trying to get some magic."
Thomas got the task of starting to play and speaking against Rory McCillroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Roose, John Ram, Tommy Flethwood and John Paulter would play against the populous golfers.
"I've put my players in such order, because I think I'm going to close it all," said B'ern about his choice for individual matches.
The start of a new German warship has been postponed
The new WMF Freight Germany was due to enter the rig in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but it will appear not earlier than next year due to inadequate systems and constantly increasing costs, according to local media news.
The launch of Rheinland-Pfalz, a major ship of absolutely new Baden-Wuerttemberg fractals, was postponed to the first half of 2019, as Die Zeit wrote, quoting the military representative.
The ship had to enter the building in 2014, but the problems that emerged after the construction hampered this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg military ships, which were scheduled for 2007, have to replace the old Bremen fractals.
They'll be armed with powerful gears, various anti-corrosive and Zenite missiles, as well as with some "Styles" technologies, such as reduced radar visibility, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among other important features – longer periods between telecommunications – more new frescoes may not enter their ports for two years.
However, constant delays mean that modern battleships, which can allow Germany to demonstrate its power outside the country, will expire until they finally come into power, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 fragment hit the headlines last year, when the German WMF officially refused to take the ship and returned its Verfi Bohm & Voss to Hamburg.
For the first time the Marine fleet returned the ship to the shore after delivery.
The reasons for the return were, of course, small, but the German media wrote about many of the “defects in software and equipment” that make the ship empty in the battle mission.
The lack of software was particularly important, because the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships have only 120 sailors -- half the crew of the old Bremen fleets.
It also found that the ship has a very large weight, which reduces its productivity and limits the possibility of further updates.
Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice the weight of the ships of the same class that used Germany in World War II.
In addition to the lack of cost allocation of the whole project, including team learning, there is also a problem.
The price reached $3.1 billion (€3.6 billion) -- although it initially amounted to €2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the new fractals are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the marine power of Germany is decreasing.
Early this year, Hans-Peter Bartells, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, stated that the IMF "has fewer and fewer ships capable of military missions".
He said that the problem sometimes increases because old ships are listed, and there are no ships to replace.
He complained that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg's frigates could join the IMF.
The nation's memory society has listened to the secret speech life
A new research that is being conducted in Scotland, aimed at finding out how the bats use the landscape in hunting for food.
Scientists are hoping to find something new in the behaviors of the unique flying dairy and to help in future actions to preserve these animals.
The research of scientists at the National Association for the Conservation of Shatland is done by small bats and also by long bats of Dabanton in the gardens of Inver in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be located in the main locations of this location to watch the speakers' actions during the season.
Society workers and walnuts will conduct mobile research using manual detectors.
The expert analysis of the sounds of all records determines the frequency of the speakers' calls, as well as what they're saying.
The map of life and the report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Slave Duar, a National Conservation Society consultant, hopes that the results will show what are the most important areas for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the advantages of creating habitats such as people, and how to support forests for the survival of bats and other animal-related animals.
The number of speakers in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and developmental work that affects and destroys the habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can be a risk, as well as sticky feed for flies and some chemicals for building materials, which are also threatened by domestic cats.
They're said not to be blind.
However, because of their nightlife, the ears spoke more sensitive than the eyes when the talk was about hunting.
They use complex elation techniques to detect bumps and obstacles along the flight path.
National society, which is responsible for more than 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land all over the country, is very serious about batons.
It's a team of ten scientists who regularly do research, check out the living places, and sometimes rescue mermaids.
The organization even created the first and only Scottish poet of the Talents in the Triune at Damfris and Galavey, where eight of the ten species of Talents live.
The head of David Thompson's coin says it's the ideal territory for speakers.
"Here, in Triv, we just have a great place for the speakers," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and a very good place to live.
But we don't know much about the bats yet, so our work here and in other monkeys will help us understand more about what they need for a better life."
He underlines the importance of checking the presence of the bats before carrying out the repair of the property, as it can unintentionally destroy one seat by killing up to 400 males and young bats, which will lead to the complete destruction of the local population.
They were told to be under shelter and they were forbidden to kill, scare, worry or destroy their seats.
Elizabeth Fair, a member of the Organization for Speaking in Scotland, urges the public to help in this matter.
She says, "We need to learn a lot more about our speakers, and we don't even know how their populations live."
Ranalda blames the rape, and his lawyers are going to go to court in German history.
Christian Ranald called his charges against the rape of the "face news," saying that people want to "advertise themselves", using his name.
His lawyers are going to trial at the German journal Der Spiegel, who published these charges.
The Forvard of the Congregation of Portugal and Yventus was accused of rape by American Catherine Mayorg in the Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Then if he had paid her 375,000 dollars for silence, he wrote on Friday Der Spiegel.
In the video Instagram Live 33-year-old Ranald addressed 142 million of his subscribers a few hours after the prosecutions were published, calling this message a "face news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's messages are fake news," said Gold Ball's five-time owner in front of the camera.
"They want to make an ad on my behalf.
It's okay.
They want to be known by mentioning my name, but it's part of my work.
I am a happy and good man," he added with a smile.
Jurists of Ranald refer the case to a court against Der Spiegel on charges, which have been referred to as "an illegal private suspect message", reports Reuters.
A lawyer named Christian Shertz said that a player would need compensation for "moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the violation of rights, and in recent years it may be the most serious violation of personal rights."
Since the incident took place in June 2009, the luxury of Palms Hovtel and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
Meeting in the nightclub of Ranald and Major would have returned to the footballer's room, where he would have raped her anonymously, as written in the documents of the district court of Clark County in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after that, Ranald withdrew and said that "99 percent" he was a "good boy" suffering from "one percent".
The documents confirm that Ranalda admitted that they had sex, but on the right side.
Major also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of the damage in the hospital, but then she agreed on a post-trial settlement, because she was "very afraid of revenge" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to reinstate the charge, because she feels a moral trauma in that case.
At the time, if Ranald had the case, he was going to go to Madrid's "Real" from Manchester Unity, and this summer he went to the Italian "Yventus", closing the deal at 100 million euros.
Britain's "always sorry" for the loss of carmakers
The Great Britain "will always regret" when it loses its world car leader's status after Brexit, said the Minister of Business Greg Clarke.
He added that his "disquieting" statement by Toyota UK to BBC about the fact that if Britain leaves the EU without any agreement, the company will temporarily cut production at the labour market in Bernston, regardless of Debbie's half.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer reported that a delay in the limit resulting from Brexit could lead to a contraction of jobs.
The factory in Bernston – where Toyota Auris and Avensis are made – released nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the Eurosause.
"In my view, when Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March, the production on our farm will stop," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Bernston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom raised the question of how a cross-border trade will be carried out when Britain leaves the EU without any agreement, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says he's going to close his Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main problem is that carmakers are talking about the risk of chain mails resulting from Brexit's unremembered.
Toyota's production line works on the basis of "precisely within a time frame", when spare parts come every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU for cars that are being ordered.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without a reminder, there may be a breach that will lead to delays and unnecessary parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to keep a job in Derby more than a day's spare part, the company said, so the production stopped.
Mr. Clark said that "The Checkers Plan" by Teresa May about future relations with the EU was "made exactly so as to avoid these border checks".
"We need a deal, we want to get the best deal that will not only allow the success of today, but also allow us to take advantage of this opportunity," he said in Today's BBC Radio 4 program.
"The information we receive not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, indicates that we must be able to continue the work of successful supply chains."
Toyota's company failed to report how long production would not work, but the future warning that added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and reduce jobs.
Peter Cowallarice, who works in Bernston for 24 years and is the coordinator of the trade union, said that the trade union members are very concerned: "I think if the jobs are cut off, they will not be renewed.
The president of the government said, "We have proposed an accurate plan of our future relations with the EU that deserves trust."
The White House states that the Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again
The very important meeting of Donald Trump with Assistant Attorney General Rodham Rosenstein could be "delayed for a week", while the fight against the candidacy of the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano said on Sunday, the representative of the White House.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Special Adviser Robert Muller, who is studying the involvement in the elections on the part of Russia, the association of Tromp's assistants with Russia, and the potential obstacle to justice on the part of the President.
To release the Trump assistant general's prosecutor or not, and thus to put Muller's independence at risk, for months, pour oil into the fire of Washington's flesh.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had considered the possibility of taking a hidden microphone to record talks with Trump, and the possibility of withdrawing the president from the passport with the help of 25 amendments.
Rosenstein oversaw it.
But last Monday he went to the White House in the middle of a rumor about what was going to fall off.
Instead, it was announced that on Thursday there would be a meeting with Trump, who was at the AAN headquarters in New York.
Trump said he "wouldn't want" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid encounters at the Senate's legal committee, where Cavana and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blyce Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation against Cavano, which further slowed the Senate's vote.
The Sara Sanders Trump's press release appeared in the Fox News Sunday Sunday Sunday program.
When she was asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "As long as it's not scheduled, maybe this week, maybe next week.
But everything's going to happen, and I always give the most new information."
Some reporters are ready to take a look at her statement: Sanders hasn't had press briefings in the White House since 10 September.
Leading the program Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the frequency of briefings is called don't ignore the reporters who "work on the public," even though she added, "I agree with the fact that they work on the public."
Then she said that direct contact with the Trump and the press would increase.
"The president met more with the press's answers than any president who was with him," she said, adding without specific facts: "We have studied these figures."
The briefings take place, Sanders reported, but "if the press has a chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better than doing it through me.
We've been trying to do this a lot, you've seen how we've been doing this in the last few weeks, and the meetings that you can ask the president directly, replace the briefings."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or takes part in meetings on the street or in press conferences with high external guests.
The president's own press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why, if free and sometimes extraordinary, he appeared in front of reporters.
Minister of Health wrote to EU workers in Scotland's health care system in front of Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to an EU health worker who works in Scotland's health system to express his gratitude for the country's name and to wish them to stay after Brexit.
Jean Freeman sent a letter less than half an hour before leaving the EU.
The Scottish government is already ready to cover the cost of EU citizens living in state services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "The summer talks between the UK and the EU continued on the way out of our country, leading to the expected decisions of this fall.
But the British government has also speeded up preparations for the script without a hint.
I know that for all of you this is a very restless time.
So I want to remind you how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee regardless of his nationality.
My colleagues from all over the EU and not only give valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health care service, also benefit patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay with us."
Christian Abercrombie carried out a transient operation after a head trauma
The Tennessee State Tigers Command Linebreaker Christian Abercrombie has carried out a temporary operation after he has suffered a head injury in a Sunday match, which his team has lost 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Master Coach Tennessee State Rod Rht told the reporter that the trauma of the player had received a break shortly before.
"He went over to the sideline and suddenly fell," said the Lord.
Trainers and doctors gave Abercomb oxygen still on the field before putting it on the ground and carrying it to establish a diagnosis.
The Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris from the WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there was no "further information about what trauma was" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the player got the trauma.
Aarcombi, a second-class sportsman, runs the first tennis state season after he leaves Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five full seizures, which gives a total of 18 seizures per season.
External British real estate buyers will pay for the bulk of their mail
According to a new plan of conservators, British real estate foreign buyers will pay a higher shipment, and extra money will go to help the homeless
This action neutralizes the success of the Corbin initiative by attracting young voters
An increase in the state's tax base is for those who don't pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance plans to get up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Today, Teresa May announce that foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher government mission, and additional money will go to help the unemployed.
This action is considered to be an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's initiative by attracting young voters, as well as providing affordable housing. It is directed to people with high income.
An increase in the government's post is directed at individuals and companies that don't pay taxes in Great Britain, and the money they get will go to the government's living-in program.
The expansion of the current state mission, including a higher level, taken two years ago, for the purchase of other houses and dwellings for rent, could amount to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to receive up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13 percent of the new builders in London buy non-residents in Great Britain, which leads to higher prices and a new buyer makes it hard to buy his first living.
Many of the rich regions of the country -- particularly the capital -- have become a "privileged" because a large number of buyers out of the border spend most of their time not living in Great Britain.
The new policy came literally a few weeks after Barris Johnson's call to reduce the government's mission for young buyers to facilitate the acquisition of the first dwelling.
He accused a huge construction firm of holding high prices for real estate by taking up the land and not using it, and called for me to cancel the quotas for the available dwelling to fix the "glorious location with the dwelling" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of residential reforms, including the monitoring of rents and the halting of the "unsubstantial" eviction.
He also wants to convey to local council more powers in the area of the building of the dwelling.
Mrs. May said, "Last year, I stated that I would devote my work to the presidency of the Prime Minister of Renewal of the British Dream - life for every new generation must be better.
This means improving our inadequate housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
But it's unfair that people who don't live in Great Britain and foreign companies can buy real estate as easily as British workers.
For too many people dream of having their own home become more and more unattainable, and the problem of unemployed remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My main ambition is to run the Scottish community"
The Sanderland coach Jack Ross said his main ambition was to ever become a coach of the Scottish congregation.
42-year-old Scottish performs the task of upgrading the club from the north-east, which is now in the third place of the First League, in three points from the first.
He went to this job in the summer, after he returned to the Scottish Prime Minister in the last season.
"I wanted to speak for my country as a player.
But it didn't work," said Ross in BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
"I grew up often sick of Scotland at the Hampden Stadium with my father, and something always made me come back.
But that's the chance to show up if I'm a successful club coach."
Among the predecessors of the Sanderland Coach Dick Advocate, David Mois, Sam Alardais, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kein, Gus Poye, and Paul Di Cany.
The former coach Aloa Atletik said he didn't feel afraid of such well-known names in such a big club, before rejecting the suggestions from Barnes and Easter Town.
"Now I'll be successful for me to answer the question, 'What can I do to get this club back to Prime Minister League?'
According to the structure and material base of the club its place is certainly in Prime Minister Lize," he said.
"It's not just to get him back there, but I'll only think of my job as a success if I can get back to the club."
Ross only worked as a coach for three years, so far he was an assistant coach at Dambarton and worked for 15 months at the Harts training station.
Then he helped Aloa come back from the third league and turn Saint-Mieren from a failure that almost hit the Championship in the victory of the next season.
Ross says he's feeling more comfortable now than in his career as a player in Clyde, Hartulpool, Falkirku, Saint Maryn and Hamilton Academic.
Reflecting on the work at Aloa, he said, "It was a really important choice."
"I really believed that training is what I need, even more than a game.
Sounds amazing, because I worked well, well earned and achieved certain heights.
But the game can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to do every week.
I'm going through it now when you talk about stress and pressure, but the training work is what you need.
I've always wanted to train and I'm doing it now, and it's the best time for me for my entire adult life."

The hot summer increased the income of British pubs competing for survival, but brought pressure on the network of restaurants.
According to the statistics of the baboon and bar group, sales increased by 2.7 percent in July, but sales decreased by 4.8 percent in restaurants.
Peter Martin of the CGA's consulting business group, which collected this statistics, said, "It's a long and sunny weather, and it's a long time before it's expected to be shared by the English community at the final of the World Championship, which means that what happened in July was what happened in June when the popes increased their sales by 2.8 percent, and the restoratives suffered even more.
Reduced sales in restaurants by 1.8 percent in June, only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars that mainly sell drinks until they show the best result in contrast to restaurants.
The popes who sell more food also turned up in the sun, although not as strong as the restaurant.
Looks like people just wanted to drink.
In pubs and bars, the sale of drinks grew by 6.6 percent, and the sale of food decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst on rest and accommodation, said, "These results are making a trend that we see from the end of beauty.
The weather and the impact of important social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales volumes in the public food market.
It's not surprising that the restaurant continues to compete, because sales have dropped by 4.8 percent per year, and it's very unpleasant if the cost keeps growing.
The long and hot summer has come at the most ceptic time for operators focused on food, and time will show that lower temperatures in October bring such expected relief."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including recently opened ones, put in July 2.7 percent, reflecting the release of fires.
The tool to track sales in British pubs, bars and restaurants is collecting and analysing the productivity of 47 active groups with a total turnover of 9 billion pounds, and it's an important approach to this branch.
Every fifth child has a secret account in the networks it hides from his parents
The study showed that every fifth child -- someone only had 11 -- has secret accounts in networks that they hide from parents and teachers.
Studying 20,000 high school students showed the increase in Facebook Insta pages
It's the news of fear that there's sex content.
Twelve percent of students say they have a parent account
Every fifth child -- someone only had 11 -- creates accounts in networks that keep them secret from their parents.
A study of 20,000 high school students found rapid growth in Insta's Facebook accounts, which would lead to Instagram's photo exchange site.
It's a piece of news that's filled with fear that there's a sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they'd run "clean" accounts to show their parents, and they'd also run private accounts.
One mother who accidentally found a secret site for her 13-year-old daughter learned that she had called on others to "ravage me."
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and a conference of independent school directors (HMC) found that 40 percent of adolescents between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them admitted that they had secret records.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said, "It's very disturbing that so many teenagers want to create places on the Internet where they won't be found by parents or teachers."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of sportsmen" in the Scottish Council of Light Athletics
Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Council of Light Athletics as a member of the Board of Directors at the annual general meeting of this body.
Doyle is the most titled lighthouse in Scotland and Highness Ien Bity described this event as a great opportunity for those who run sports to get a lot of benefits from her experience at different levels, which is an international figure for the past decade.
"Alied is used with great respect in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world's sports community, and we're sure that easy athletes in Scotland will get a lot of benefit from her work in the council," Bity said.
Doyle said, "I want to act as a sportsman's voice, and I hope that I will help manage sports in Scotland."
An American who won gold 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and two more gold medals at the other Olympics, and who is now an expert on BBC, can't walk after a microsult has survived.
He wrote on Twitter: "The month ago, I was hit.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it would only take time to see if I could handle it and to what extent.
It was a hard job, but I completely recovered, learned to walk again and now I'm practicing in the corner!
Thank you for the support message!"
A small pump advertisement where mothers are compared to cows, shared their views on the Internet
The small-pump production company divided its opinion by issuing an ad that compares feeding women to cows that are breast-feeding.
To mark the start of what they call "the world's first dedicated small pump," the consumer company Elvie released an Iranian music commercial on the basis of a video to show the freedom it gives to a nursing mother.
The four true mothers dance in the coves under the song, where they say, "Yes, I give myself, but I don't have the tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it doesn't wash, it's my chest."
She said, "Come on, I'm feeding my children, come on, come on, I'm giving my women."
However, an advertisement, which was posted on Facebook's page, triggered a hot debate on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments.
"It's a very bad decision to use knives to advertise this product.
Like us, they must stop and order to give milk, here's only their children picking in a few days," wrote one viewer.
Elvie's baby pump is indiscriminately hidden in a food brigade (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "It's understood in a traumatic way for both mother and child.
But why not use them for advertising a small pump for mothers with no children?"
Someone said, "That's an unplanned advertisement."
Others defended the commercial, and one woman wrote that she thought the song was fun.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd like to have this if I'd breast-feed.
Breathing the milk makes me feel a cow.
It's a little crazy commercial, but I liked it.
It's a great product," she wrote.
Another comment: "A very fun advertisement directed at a mother that detachs milk pumps (usually at the workplace or in the toilet) and hears themselves as "cows".
It doesn't approve of advertising and does not condemn small-scale industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women showed that they all danced with invisible small pumps hidden in the brigades.
The concept of a advertising company is based on the fact that many women who use small pumps feel like they're being killed.
However, the pump Elvie Pump is completely idle, has no rights, no pipes and is inextricably hidden in the brigade for feeding women, gives women freedom of movement, allows them to keep children and even leave the house while working on the device.
Ana Ballarin, partner and creative director of Mother's company, observed: "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a distinct and corrective start.
Conducting a parallel between feeding women and small cows, we wanted to pay attention to the sucking of the milk and its difficulty while at the same time showing fun and good manners how a new small pump takes an extraordinary freedom of movement.
It's not the first time that Elvie's tiny pump is in the center of attention.
During the London week, the mother's fashion of two children appeared on the floor in clothes from Martha James, using this product.
Hundreds of children-migrants without a rainy noise transport into a housing camp on a technical limit
Although the number of border crossings in the month has almost changed, the number of children in detention has increased sharply, partly because of the harsh rhetoric and politics of the Trump administration, which have hampered the placement of children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are illegal immigrants who are afraid to put their own home in the country, taking responsibility for the child.
The risks increased considerably in June when the federal authorities announced that a potential sponsor and other senior members of the household homeowners would have to drop their fingerprints and data would be handed over to the immigration authority.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a high-ranking immigration and nursing associate, presented a report to Congress on the arrests of dozens of people who were asked to sponsor minors without supervision.
Later, the agency reported that 70% of those arrested before had no jurisdiction.
"Approximately 80 percent of the individuals who are sponsors or members of their homeowners are illegal in the country, and much of them constitute aliens with a criminal past.
That's why we keep chasing such people," said Mr. Olbens.
For children to be treated more quickly, journalists introduced new rules that require some to appear in court for a month from the date of detention, which is, according to the workers of shelter, the standard period of 60 days earlier.
A large number of people are going to use video-relationship instead of being present in a private court.
Those who have no grounds for granting the aid will quickly be deported.
According to shelter workers and messages from sources in the system that have appeared in the last few months, the longer children remain in detention, the higher the likelihood of depression or increased anxiety that could lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
The lawyers say that in more massive institutions, such as Tarnillia, these problems are found to be much stronger, as the symptoms of a child being in a state of poverty are more likely to be ignored by the size of the facility.
They add that moving children into a residential town without providing time for emotional preparation or for development with friends may make the trauma worse, which many have already faced.
Syria requires immediate "occupational forces" from the United States, France and Turkey
In response to the AAN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mual has also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war that continues in the country for eight years.
The speech, which is also an intermediary of the Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces are illegally on the Syrian land, on the basis of a fight against terrorism, and that "they will be considered accordingly."
"They must leave immediately without any conditions," he said at a meeting of the Assembly.
The museum insisted that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people died since 2011, and millions of people had to leave their homes, “the war with terrorism is practically over”.
He announced that Damascus intends to continue "to carry on this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and "lovely illegal outside presence".
There are about 2,000 U.S. soldiers in Syria, who primarily play the role of instructors and advisers in the army of Kurds and Syrian Arabs, who are opposed to President Bashar Assad.
France's earthly contingent in this devastated war country is more than 1,000 soldiers.
With regard to refugees, Mulalem stated that the conditions for return were friendly and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading ironic fears" that include refugees abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organisations to pass on their return," he says.
"They're policy-makers on a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped to rebuild until a political agreement on the end of the war is reached between Assad and the opposition.
The AAN diplomats report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last major resistance of the Idlib rebels created an opportunity for political talks.
The Russian-Turkey Mining has prevented a wide range of Syrian forces supported by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Mulam stressed that the agreement had "adequate terms", and hoped that military action would be directed against the khazist, including the number of bees associated with Al-Qaeda's Nurser front, which would "be destroyed".
AAN Staffan de Mistor's mission is to call for the first meetings of a new committee to be held by government representatives and opposition to develop a constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
The author stated that the work of the committee should be restricted to the "view of the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why the Trump would go on a second term
On this basis, Mr. Trump will win in the 2020 elections if, as many liberal viewers hope, the impimpication and the scandal do not eventually complete his presidency.
And this will, of course, be "the only dramatic end of the presidency for all history!"
At this point, there is no sign of fatigue in the audience.
From 2014, ratings in the premium have grown more than twice – up to 1.05 million per CNN and almost three times – up to 1.6 million per MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in the period, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC channel's "The Rachel Maddow Show" broadcast brought 3.5 million viewers to the screen and exceeded cable television ratings in the evening when the headlines were broadcast.
"It's a fire to which people are drawn, because we don't understand it," says Neil Barr, director of the ABC drama "Peremnik" about the Cabinet member of ministers who become president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
In Nelli Scowell, the site of the screenwriter comedy and the authors of the book "A couple of funny details and some harsh facts about the breakthroughs in the Hollywood boys' club," there are other theories.
She mentions a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he's making me happy," said Mrs. Scowell to me.
Chaos is still precious and that can be entertaining.
Of course, unlike the rest of the TV, the federal lines that come out of Washington can become as definite a future as the case of Ru v. Wade, depending on whether the families of immigrants can unite and healthy the world economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged viewers.
And yet, when you look at the sixth hour as a group of experts considering the use of Bob Woodward's "not print information" in the book "Strach", the manor of Paul Manafort for $15,000 with a fluorescent skin (responsive of pride, as written in The Washington Post), and the consequences of the severe descriptions of Storm Daniels, um, Mr. Tramp's anatomy, it goes beyond simply the desire to be in the chair.
I, for example, will never look at Super Maria just as before.
"Sometimes what he does makes you feel like you're looking at the reality of the show he shows every evening," says Brand Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and creator of the Pawn Stars about the changing art of the Tramp show and the constant turning of the club ("Sparing" with the NFL, approval by Kim Chen.
You can't let yourself miss even one episode, or you'll stay out of the trend.
When I spoke to Mr. Flass this week, behind the windows of his house on the north coast of Kauai stood a hot sunday and 30 degrees hot, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC while writing CNN.
He could not give up, not when Brett Cavan got up before the Senate's judicial committee, considering the future of the Supreme Court, which was hanging on the bench.
"I remember the girls when we released these crazy shows, and people said, "This is the beginning of Western civilization," said Mr. Fles.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out that they were right."

External cash flows fall into a severe pre-selective race of temporary elections in the representatives' chamber
No wonder that Pennsylvania's 17th election district has created a cash market, thanks to the change in the boundaries of Congress' districts, two candidates participate in the elections for one place.
A recently repatriated suburb of Pittsburgh is surrounded by a democrat, a member of the Chamber of Representatives of Konar Lemba, who won his place in another district in the past spring.
Lembo opposes another acting MP, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely in line with the new 17th.
The cards were repatriated after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in November, stating that the voices of the old areas were unconstitutionally counted for the benefit of the Republicans.
The pre-election race in the new 17th district led to a decline in the funding of the company by major party groups, the Democratic Company's Congress Committee (DRC) and the National Republican Company's National Committee (NRC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory over a wide-lit selection in the 18th district of Pennsylvania in March.
This place has been occupied by the Republic for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump has won a 20-point strike.
Political experts have a small advantage over the democrats.
The United States appreciated Salvador's support for China and then withdrew
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already supported the position of Beijing, despite minor opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump met with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Warela in June 2017 and settled in a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Tromp Command.
Representatives of the State Department decided to respond to US diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with "the recent decisions on Taiwan's non-recognition," said Hezer Nawert State Secretary at the beginning of this month.
However, sanctions were considered only in relation to El Salvador, which received approximately US$ 140 million in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include a reduction in financial assistance and targeted restrictions on issuing visas, would be painful for the country of Central America with its high level of unemployment and murder.
As far as the completion of the internal meeting is concerned, the North and Central American representatives have postponed the conference to a high level, dedicated security and economic prosperity, which would continue to be an analogous meeting in the past year, which has been assessed as a step in preventing immigration in the United States.
But by mid-September, the senior officials of the administration were still aware that they wanted the conference to take place and actually stopped the discussion of the question of the punishment of El Salvador.
According to diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pension will now take a conference, which will be held in mid-October, in the sign that the administration is in charge of entrepreneurship.
And three U.S. envoys without a rainstorm returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new cruel envoys or punishments from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debates that were described by three American officials, including the number of two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues while maintaining anonymity.
Their messages are confirmed by others, close to the administration of analysts, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
Learn History
The next step can be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Muller on possible obstacles to justice by Mr. Trump, for example what is currently very difficult evidence in public documents.
It is reported that Mr. Muller has taken note of the investigation into the possibility of a campaign by Trump and Russia in an election attack.
When Congress changes the master, Mr. Trump lies before the face of responsibility before this body, just as he dares to speak before the electors again, and perhaps eventually before the jury with the number of his colleagues.
There's a lot of kali, and I don't want to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, just like he's in Europe.
All of us, on either side of the Atlantic, have to make a choice that determines how long the struggle will take.
In 1938 the German officers were ready for the coup against Hitler, if only the West had supported and opposed him in Munich.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the coming years of bloodshed.
History revolves around such broken moments, and the unmistakable march of democracy is accelerated or postponed.
Right now, Americans have faced a few of these break-ins.
What happens if Mr. Trump disengages the mediator of Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls Mr. Muller's fate?
Rosenstein found himself in a difficult position since the paper wrote about what he had suggested last year to write down the president's words in secret and pondered his propriety.
Mr. Rosenstein says the translation "The Times" is not correct.
"How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation of Brett Cavan's case is not universal or fair, or if it is confirmed in the Court of Human Rights, despite the fact that the charges of sexual violence and inconsistencies are well-relianced?
And first of all, will we vote in favour of Congress, which will attract Mr. Trump to responsibility?
If we don't go through these trials, we're going to have a long winter for democracy.
But I do believe that we will not teach thanks to the lesson I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Hebrew who was deported to Asvenci in the same Nazi regime that once bought my peacehouse.
She survived, played in America, and after 60 years she sent me to light the Saturday candles on this table with a satchel.
With such a legacy as I can't be an optimist in relation to our future?"

Grem Dorans of Rangers is an optimist-oriented front-end of Rapid Vienna.
Rangers take Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after an impressive night in Spain over the Williams at the beginning of this month will allow them to safely leave the G League of Europe.
Trauma's knee prevented Grem Dorans from reaching 2-2 in the season, but he believes that Rangers will be able to use this result as a tramp.
"It was an important match for us, because "Villareal" is a strong opponent," says a 31-year-old footballer.
"We started the game, thinking we could get something, and earned a point.
Maybe at the end we could kill the ball, but the whole night also became a good result.
They looked better in the first time, but in the second we took ourselves into our hands, and we had the best half field.
Thursday will have another important one for European football night.
I hope we can earn three points, but it'll be a complicated game, because they've shown a good result in the last game, but considering the crowd of spectators on the courts, I'm sure we can handle them and show them a good game.
Last year was a difficult one, both because of my injuries and the change in the club itself, but now we have a confidence factor.
Good command, and the boys really get the fun of the game; training is productive.
I hope we can move forward, win the last season and make a success."
Women lose their sleep out of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the members of the question had an accurate understanding of what they wanted to care for, a few of them talked about it with members of their families.
About half of the people who participated in community research reported that they talked to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their kids.
"People want family members to take care of them, but they don't take steps to discuss it," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Agency.
That's what it's worth to start with.
Consider it with your husband and children: your family will not be ready to help you if you do not listen to your wishes in advance.
Work with the consultant and the family and consider where and how to get medical help, because this choice can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Draw a focus on the financial consultant. It can also help you to find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of funding for long-term supervision may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that helps cover these expenses or you can self-secured your life – provided you have money.
Deal with legal documents: get court battalies.
Get a period of time on medical care to assign a period of time to control your medical care and to ensure that specialists do your wishes if you can't talk.
Consider, too, the possibility of relying on financial management.
Select a certain person to make financial decisions and to pay your bills if you are inactive.
Don't forget about the details: imagine that your elderly father needs immediate medical attention, and he's on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about forbidden drugs and the presence of allergies?
Write down these details in writing to be ready.
"They not only have a role to play in financial matters but also in the professionalism of doctors," Martin adds.
"What medicines are needed?
Who will take care of the dog?
You have to plan everything."
In Ilfracomb, the man was shot several times with a pneumatic rifle.
The man got a couple of pneumatic glitches when he went home at night.
For 40 years, he was in the Oxford Grove District of Ilfracomb, Devon County, when he was shot in the chest, live, and hand.
Police officers described a shooting that took place around 02:30 at local time as an "accident."

His trauma is not a threat to life, the police ask the witness to contact them.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to the official, at least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that swept across the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, and is expected to be the number of deaths.
Because of the disconnection of the relationship of journalists engaged in humanitarian aid, they couldn't get any information from Dongal's regency, the area north of Paul, which is closer to the concentration of a 7.5-ball earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Pala, after a stressful disaster.
Here are some key facts about Paul and Dongal on the island of Slovenes:
Palo is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 people for 2017.
When the earthquake occurred and the tsunami came, the city celebrated the 40th anniversary of its establishment.
Dongala is a regent that is located more than 180 miles (300 km) on the north-west coast of the island of Sulawesi.
Regent is an administrative unit below the government, with 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and the rural host are the main economics of the province of central Slovenia, especially in the coastal region of Dongal.
The acquisition of nickel is also important for the faith, but mainly concentrated in Moravia, on the opposite coast of Slovene.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Reduction, Paul and Dongal have been hit by tsunamis several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed in Dongal, hundreds of homes were destroyed.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Dongal in 1996, resulting in the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is in a seismic-active Pacific fire ring and its regular rocking of earthquakes.
The following is a list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: a strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indian Ocean in the north of Sumatra on 26 December caused the tsunamis, which swept across 14 countries, resulting in the deaths of 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in the Ocean.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March-earth of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nis, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 magnitude occurred south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, causing the tsunamis that swept across the south coast, resulting in the deaths of some 700 people.
2009: In the town of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra, a 7.6 ball earthquake occurred.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-ball earthquake took place on one of the islands of Mentawa outside Sumatra, calling for tsunamis up to 10 meters, which destroyed ten villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Poor Earthquake turned against the Regent of Susie Jay in the Acheh province, causing riots and panic, as he reminded people of the desolation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunamis.
This time the tsunami didn't come, but more than 100 people died under the ruins of the buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes have turned against the tourist islands of Indonesia Lambok, resulting in more than 500 deaths, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists without being able to leave.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence in the family
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice-president of Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
The 29-year-old Pauline from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, which countered the domestic violence and opposition arrest published on Saturday by the Alaskan state police.
According to the police report, when one of the acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he picked up her phone.
According to the KTUU, Pailin is located in the next island of Matanusko-Sustainable under $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he reported to himself "precisely innocent," when he was asked if he would admit his guilt, the network reported.
Palina's been charged with three violations of Class A, which threatens to free him up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He's also indicted for Class B crimes, which is punishable by the release of the day-to-day freedom and fine of $200.
This is not the first case when the charges against Palina were brought.
In December 2017, he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to tell her about the alleged attack.
The matter is currently being examined by the Alaskan Veterinary Court.
In November 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, with reporting domestic violence and with the storage of arms in the state of alcohol abuse in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had hit her face.
Sara Palin has been criticised by a group of vets in 2016 for her son’s harsh behavior with posttraumatic syndrome, which he was called upon to serve in Iraq.
Earthquakes in Indonesia, tsunamis: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died as a result of an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Slovenes on Friday.
The Earthquake of 7.5 balls called the tsunamis and broke down thousands of houses.
Electricity and networks are not working, and the number of victims is expected to grow in the next few days.

The Federal Prosecutor's Office requires a rare death sentence for a suspected terrorist in New York City.
The New York Federal Public Prosecutor's Office is charged with a death penalty for Saifula Saipov, a suspected terrorist in New York City, resulting in the death of eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipaw, a 30-year-old man in October, was used by the company Home Depot to ride on a bike along six West-side in Lower Manhattan, beating pedestrians and bicycles on his way.
In order to justify the death sentence, according to a report of the intention to punish the death penalty that occurred in the South District of New York, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "slowly" killed eight people and "slowly" caused serious physical injuries.
According to the court's materials, for both violations, the possible punishment is like a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury of Assalamyl Saipov's next indictment of 22 points, which included eight charges in the murder to support the missile; this item is usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of means of transport.
According to the prosecutors, the attack required “old and deliberate planning”, and describing the Saipov crimes, they used such phrases as “aggressive, harsh and dissuasive”.
"Syfla Habibulaevich Saipa has caused trauma, has caused damage and has caused the loss of his family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ana-Lóra Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlie, Erna Ferro, Erna Diego Mendez and Alejandro Damien Pignuk," the report states.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
Since the last start of a criminal case with a sentence like a death penalty in the South of New York County, it's been ten years.
The defendant, Halid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug addicts, but eventually he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
For the last time, the death penalty in New York for the federal case was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple, who were sentenced to two years earlier for being convicted of spying for the benefit of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
A couple of Rosenbergs were sentenced to electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipaw, an exit from Uzbekistan, according to the court documents, demonstrated that there were no objections within days and months of the attack.
According to the police, he stated the following that he felt satisfaction from his aunt.
According to the accused's imprisonment, Saipov informed the authorities that he was inspired by the video viewer of the Islamic State on the phone.
He also asked for permission to hang the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital, reported to the police.
He won't be guilty of a 22-point conviction.
David Patan, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were "unreasonably disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to impose a death penalty, rather than a profit-free release, is only to prolong the pain of these events for all participants," Patan said.
Saipov's defence team has previously asked the prosecutors not to demand a death penalty.
A member of the Torah Parliament says that Nigel Faraj should mark talks on Brexit.
Today, during a protest at the Tora's conference, Nigel Faraj said he would "mobilize the national army".
Former Ukip leader said politicians should "sympathize" with Eurosceptics – as one of the members of the Teresa May parliament offered their candidacy for talks with the EU.
A member of parliament from the Peter Bowe Conservatory party said during a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have "exited", if Mr. Faraz had borrowed the estate of a scrotum on Brexit.
But the problem faced by Mrs. May, trying to imitate her different supporters, was even worse when the Tora, who advocated the preservation of EU membership, faced a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain a compatriot checker agreement under constant pressure on the part of the supporters and workers of the exit, as well as the EU itself.
The allies insist on trying to close the deal with Brussels, despite a negative reaction, and want to force the Eurosceptics and the Labrasists to choose between the package and the "unsatisfied" package.
Mr. Bown said at a meeting in Salihale, "Leave Means Leave," which he wanted to "get the Checker out of the board".
He suggested that Mr. Faraday do the same and set up duties for talks with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would have gone out," he said.
A member of Parliament from Velingbor said, "I'm for Brexit, but we need to get out of the Czech Plan."
Addressing the EU, he said: "We do not wage world wars to be dependent.
We want to enforce our own laws in our country."
Mr. Boun rejected the assumption that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their opinion and want to stay is not entirely true."
Brexit's supporter and Thoreau Jenkins was also on March, and in conversation with reporters, she said, "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to people.
"The Czech plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and activists who actually go out and pick us up.
Please turn down the plan and start listening."
In a sharp turn to Miss May, she added, "Prime Ministers stay on the passport when they keep their promises."
Mr. Faraj said that politicians needed to “sympathize with discomfort” when they were going to betray the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a matter of trust between us – peoples and politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "It won't come out of your hands."
In return to the crowd he said, "I want you to make those politicians who are willing to betray Brexit feel uncomfortable.
"We mobilize the national army of this country, which has given us victory in Brexit, and we will never be calm until we become independent, self-righteous, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the exit officials went through Birmingham before they had two hours of meeting in the center of the city.
Several activists blew the Tories Against Brexit (Tori against Brexit) banners after the group was launched in these outputs.
The Liberian Per Lord Adanis has come across the conservators with the opportunity of the security problem they faced because of the evening program at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can be ready to use the IT system and all the technology for Canada plus, for free trade, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
Such a thing as a good Brexit. There is no such thing as," he added.
Warren plans to pay close attention to the President's round-up
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the election in November, she "has shown keen interest in the President's sit-in process."
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts told of his future on Saturday during a general march in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is going to go on a re-election, to face her as a member of the Republican Jaff Diell, who was an elder of the Trump company in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the centre of the debate as the potential opponent of the Trump in 2020.
From the moment the Trump entered the planting it was already the 36th meeting with voters in the form of a general east, which took place on Saturday in Haliyak.
One of the participants asked if she was planning to talk to the president.
Warren replied that the time had come for the woman to go to Washington to correct the broken government, and for this to be the head of the woman."
Archival took place after the death of the basketball player Sims from Louisiana State University.
The Baton-Russia Police, Louisiana State, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the murder of a basketball player, SHL Wade Sims, was arrested on Friday.
The Baton-Russia Police Department reported the 20-year-old Dietan Simpsan's arrest during a press conference that took place 11 hours in the morning of the East.
On Friday, they published a video of the shooting with a request to help identify the person who was painting on it.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot at the campus of the South University on Friday morning.
"Wayd Sims has had a gunshot wound in his head as a result of his death," reported the officer of Murphy J. Paul's police officer, a journalist on the 247sports channel on Saturday.
Wade stood up for his friend and was shot by Simpson.
In the course of a question, Simpson admitted that he was at the crime scene, was armed and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson did not resist in the army and was taken to the custody of the police station in East-Bonton-Russia district.
A sportsman who grew up 6 feet, 6 inches (201 cm) in Baton-Rose, Sams last season played 32 games, 10 of which were on the square from the beginning, in the middle of the street 17.4 minutes, dropped 5.6 points and took 2.9 teams for the game.
Gran Pri Russia: Louis Hamilton approached the world champion after having gained victory over Sebastian Fetel at the internal court
From the moment that Walter Bots stepped up on Saturday on Louis Hamilton's qualifying car, it became clear that the instructions within the Mercedes team play a significant role in the race.
Bots pulled a good place out of the trenches and almost left Hamilton at the will of fate, while he defended his place on the first two saws and invited Fetel to attack his friend by command.
The motel first went to the pit stop and left Hamilton kneeling at the end of a common crowd of thugs, which was precisely this manoeuvre had to become decisive.
The Mercedes pilot went to the Pittsburgh round and went out behind the Fetel, but Hamilton went out after several round-to-round maneuvers, which forced the Ferrari driver to leave the inner space free, risking being held after the double maneuver to protect himself on the third turn.
Max Ferstopen on his 21st birthday started from the back of a network and was at the end of the first round in the seventh place.
Then he led most of the race, while the dogs were holding their horses, for he wanted to quickly finish, hug Kim Ryconen and take the fourth place.
As a result he went to the pit-step of the 44th round, but could not increase the speed of the other eight rounds, so Ryan took the fourth place.
It was a difficult day, because Walter had all the outgoing speeches fantastically and had expressed himself as a true gentleman if I were allowed to say so.
"The team has done excellent work to take the first and second places," Hamilton commented.
It was a really bad body language
President Donald Trump laughed Senator Dean Finnstein at a meeting on Saturday because she insisted that she was not the source of the escape letter of Christian Blaise Ford, in which she accused a candidate at the Brett Kawan Supreme Court of sexual violence.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not direct himself to a statement given by Ford before the Senate Judicial Committee, but rather commenting that what was happening in the Senate showed how people could be "slow, hostile and unfair".
"The only thing that can happen is that it's beautiful what's going on in the last few days in the Senate, that's if you see anger when you see bad people, bad people and false people," he said.
"If you read about press releases and escapes, then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diana Finnstein, is that your escape?
Remember her answer... you lost the document - "oh, oh, what?
No, no.
I had nothing to do with it."
Wait a minute.
We let go... no, we didn't,' he added, advising the senator.
Finnstein sent a letter in July with a detailed statement of the charges filed against the Kawan ford, and he ran away early in September--but Finnstein denied that the escape had taken place from her office.
"I didn't cover Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't let her history run," said the Finnstein Committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked for the story to remain confidential and I satisfied her request."
But her refusal probably did not like the president who so commented on this during the Saturday meeting, "That's what I'm going to tell you, it was a really bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
As he continued to defend his candidacy in the Supreme Court, accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that the democrats use charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to return their power by any means.
You see the authority, the measure, and they're the ones they're hurting, the one they're going to have to go through to get power and control, -- the president's words, Mediaite.
Elite League: Dandy Scart – Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Duyer killed two sharks for the Giants in battle against Dandy.
Dandy Stir played for the five-year-old defeat that Belfast Giants had brought against them in the elite league, winning a 5-3 game back in the domestic match on Saturday.
Thanks to the beating of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Baville Giants, they led on to two sycamores in the beginning.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney leveled the number before Dwyer renewed the leadership of the Giants.
François Bushar from Dandi leveled the number, after which Lucas Lundwald Nielsen won the command of victory with two heads.
This turned out to be a third defeat in the Elite League for the Adam Kiff team, which won Dandi with the number 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
Commands met four times a season; in the previous three matches won the Giants.
The first goal for the fourth minute of the match (03:35) killed Douayer from the fall of Kendall McFol, and still in four minutes Babilé doubled the number after the fall of David Rutherford.
In the first period (13:10) Sullivan opened a number on the part of the masters of the field, and then Cún raised the number after Matt Markhardt's transmission (15:16).
The Dawyer secured the Giants of leadership on his way out for the first break, killing his second crew at the end of the first period.
Taking the side, he regrouped, and the Busher reassessed the bill, killing the Shib at the numerical command (27:37).
Coun and Charles Carcoran helped Nilsen drive Dandi to the leader for the first time at the end of the second period, and he won the victory together with the fifth team number in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five meetings, are playing the last match on the home street against Milton Kanes on Friday.
Airshipman gin, rescuing hundreds of passengers from the earthquake
An airman in Indonesia, Heroes, died, ensuring a successful flight of hundreds of passengers on board.
Over 800 people died, and many disappeared without news after a massive earthquake on the island of Slovenes on Friday, which caused tsunamis.
Strong underground pushes continue, and many people are buried under the clouds in the city of Paul.
Although his colleagues fought with the escape, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his residence at the high school, which the wilder was climbing to the airport of Paul Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
He remained in place until the ship of 6321 Batik Air, which was at that moment in the airfield, did not get rid of the earth.
Then he jumped out of the hospital floor when he decided that she was breaking up.
Later he died in the hospital.
According to the Australian ABC News programme, the Air Navigation Indonesia representative, John Syreit, may have saved hundreds of lives.
We had prepared a return from Balipopan to Kalimantan, which had to be carried to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the return to Paul.
"Our hearts are broken," he added.
However, the country's authorities are careful that the number of victims can reach a few thousand, while the agencies to reduce the danger of stressful disasters claim that access to the city of Dongal, Sigi and Boston is limited.
A representative of Sotopa Purva Nugroho's agency said, "Perhaps the number of victims is going to increase, as many bodies have not yet been able to escape from the debris."
The waves, which reached six meters, devastated Paul, where a mass funeral would take place on Sunday.
Vulnerable and commercial aircraft are carrying humanitarian aid.
Russ Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, reported "Sky News": "Every minute the car "fast" brings the body.
Clear water does not touch.
They're making stores everywhere."
Hen Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said, "CNN," "Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help those who survived, but we don't know what's waiting for them here.
It's already a tragedy, but it can all get much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Jack Ododa, arrived in Pala on Sunday and told the soldiers, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
Are you ready?' says the CNN.
Earlier this year, in Indonesia, she suffered earthquakes in Lamboka, where more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: According to Air Niguini, one man went missing after a plane crashed into the lagoon
The airline that made the trip, which made an accident landing in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, had previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew were fortunately evacuated from the plane that was flying, and now reportedly disappeared without the information of one passenger.
The Air Niguini company reported in press release that on Saturday's condition it could not report the location of one passenger-man.
The airline reported that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and the following to find a man.
The airline did not immediately report details about the passenger; for example, his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the rest of the passengers and the crew after the plane was landed on the water while trying to land at the airport of the island of Chowk.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people were in the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday; they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the breach, and the exact sequence of events, remain undiscovered.
According to both the airline and the U.S. V.S.A., the plane landed in the camp without moving to the residential area.
And some of the witnesses said that the plane jumped in the parking lot.
According to American passenger Bill Janes, the plane flew very low.
"It was very successful," said Janes.
According to his words, he and the others were able to walk through the water into the crash exits of the plane, which had already danced.
He said that the shipowners had stumbled and began to scream, as well as that he had got a small head injury.
The U.S.A. reports that the sailors, who framed the crash of the dock, also helped rescue using an inflated boat to transport people to the shore until the plane sank at about 100 feet [30 m] deep.
According to the Air Safety Networks, 111 people were killed when they violated the aircraft registered in Papua New Guinea in the last 20 years, but none of them belonged to Air Niguini.
An analyst restores the movement of events at night when the woman was burned by the animal
On Saturday, the prosecution completed the presentation of evidence in the review of a man's case, who was accused of being burned by a resident of the state of Mississippi in 2014.
A U.S. Ministry of Justice analyst, Paul Roulette, for a few hours, gave evidence as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described the jury as using cell phone records to recognize the move of 29-year-old Quentin Tellis and 19-year-old victims of Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
As The Clarion Ledger reported, Roulette said, he received information about the place from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, that he was opposed to his previous statement.
When it was reported that his cell phone was near Chambers' phone while, according to his statement, he was with his friend Michael Sanford confirmed, the police were directed to invite Sanford.
Leonardo gave a statement on Saturday and confirmed that on that day he had not been in the city.
When the accused party asked whether Tellis was telling the truth that Sanford was in the van that night, he claimed that he was "misleading, as my van was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was Tellis' claim that he was familiar with Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone records showed that they knew each other all week.
According to Roulette, after some time after the death of Chambers Tellis, she deleted her messages, calls and contacts from her phone.
"He scurried her out of his life," said Haley.
The side of protection must begin the conflict of sides on Sunday.
According to the judge, it is expected that the case will be referred to the jury later that same day.
The High Breed: What is a known hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio intends to overlook the negative view of this genre, filling his music with stable institutions.
The High Breed, a group from Bristol, says that the hip-hop has distanced itself from its sources: political statements and horrific questions.
They want to go back to his roots and make the conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as Akala and Lowkey returned to a collection such as The Fugees and Common, popularity in the United Kingdom.
Another blacksmith?!
She from New York goes to court for a "racial" post post-exam.
She from New York falls before a marriage couple for a discriminating dismissal after receiving a random text sent by her mother with a complaint that she is “one more black.”
The couple denies that they are racists, balancing the call to "emergency."
In 2016, Lance Plasca-Flixman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment, finding that the new bride, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived on her first day of work.
"NEEEEEEEEE, ANOTHER EARNING," wrote Mrs. Plaska-Flacksman in her husband's message.
However, instead of sending his husband, she twice sent a message to Miss Morris.
As New York Post reported, understanding the error, Plasca-Flacksman's disability was dismissed by Ms. Morris, claiming that the previous girl, who was also African, was ill at work, and that she was waiting for her Philippines.
Miss Morris paid the day's work and sent home to Uber.
Now Morris falls into court and wants to get compensation for dismissal according to the conditions on which she was initially hired, even without contract: $350 a day for six months with her life.
"I want to show them what it is not possible to do," she said on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejected the charges of racism, claiming that the dismissal of Morris was a reasonable solution, considering that they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent her what she shouldn't have said.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said the husband, Joel Plaska.
"And would you trust your children because they were rude, even by accident?
Your niece?
Is it not?"
The plane evened the call to "demnification" and reported that his wife had been born only two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
"And will you be able to persecute a man in such a position?
It's pretty hard," added the investment-banking specialist.
Although the judiciary is still ongoing, the public opinion quickly condemned a couple in social networks, subjecting them to harsh criticism of their behaviour and logic.
The editors of the Sugtan have warned that readers will not be opposed to the bear that speaks in a new sheet
Bond's daughter Karen Yunkel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, wrote about the letter: "The difficulty is putting herself in the place of the one who reads it first before it is published.
So interesting it is to read, already knowing of the great success of Podington."
She said that her father, who was a BBC operator, had been careful to write a book for children about a small tidal bear, was optimistic in spite of the fact that his work was not accepted and added that the 60-year-old edition of the book was "serious-sweet" after his death last year.
She added that her father quietly was proud of his final success, speaking of the Podington, whose description she describes as "a very important member of our family."
"He was quite a quiet man, and not quite a provocative," she said.
"But since Podington was so real to him, it was almost parental pride for a child that was demanded: thou shalt be proud of them, though it is indeed not thy merit.
I think he's been looking at the success of subjugated precisely in such a key.
Although it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always gave up the right self-substance."
My daughter died, and I had to develop with her on the phone
After her daughter was sent to Nica Louis Pastera's hospital, where the doctors fought hard for her life.
"Now she phoned regularly to tell me that everything was really bad that she didn't stand," said Mrs. Eden-Laperuz.
"Then I called Nad to say that she was dying for the next two minutes, and I had to develop with her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tash, I love you so much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors gave to beat her heart, slowly left her body.
She died a while ago, and it was the end.
I just had to sit there, knowing that everything was unfolding there.
I could neither groan nor cry nor cry because there were family and people around me.
I had to hold on."
After all, Mrs. Eden-Laperus, who had survived the loss of her daughter, had a village on the plane with other passengers -- and they didn't know at all what she had to go through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I bowed my head and with my face all the time flowed with tears.
It was hard to explain, but it was in the field that a feeling of compassion for Ned caught me.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how he loved her."
Women who are sad enough to draw cards to avoid being killed on a bridge
Two women who lost their dear people who ended up suicide do everything they can to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey draw cards on the hot words and phone numbers that people can get on the bridge in Wales.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he started depression, and at 18 he ended his life with suicides.
"I don't want other parents to feel like I do," she said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Lidney, said her son was a talented boss with a contagious smile.
"The woods knew his smile.
People said that his smile would light up any room."
However, before he died, he quit his job because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11, found his brother’s body when he finished his suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly worried that this could be an unpleasant outcome."
Mrs. Davis has created cards so people know that there are people in the world you can talk to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay silent, you need to talk."
Mrs. Hasfres, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her partner, who lived with him for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say that he was sad, or that he was depressed, or something like that," she said.
"For a few days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
On the solemn day he was very depressed: when the children opened gifts, he did not even look at them."
She said that his death was a great injury to them, but she had to live with it: "In the family there was a huge hole.
It's just killing us.
But you have to keep on living and fighting."

Future Brett Cavan is uncertain, as the FBI is investigating
"I thought that we could have what he wanted – limited in time and in the field of research – we could get a little unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the committee was "dissolved" because of what actually happened in the sample.
Why doesn't Mr. Kavana and his Republican supporters want the FBI to do the investigation?
Their wish is sometimes interpreted.
The interim elections in five weeks, November 6th -- if the Republics are expected to suffer at once, then they will be weakened in their efforts to choose the highest court for them.
George Bush called the senator to discuss Mr. Cavano's support, who worked in the White House during the Bush presidency and through him met his wife Ashley, who then worked as a personal secretary for Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Until you realized if Mr. Kavano would get at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Vice-President Mike Pens to solve the problem of the equality of votes and to confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean winners has fallen under Kima's leadership
The number of North Korean runners down in South Korea since Kim Chen came to power seven years ago, a South Korean journalist said.
Bo Sun Park, bringing data from the South Korean Ministry of Uniting, said that last year there were 1127 winners, and in 2011, 2706.
Mr. Park stated that the main reasons for this are strengthened border control between North Korea and China and the higher costs that had been incurred by the smugglers for the reconstruction.
Phen'ian didn't comment on it at all.
Most of the winners from the north with what they get in South Korea's citizenship.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Korean residents illegally crossed the border after the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most of them run across China, with the longest border in North Korea. It's easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans, which is highly protected.
China treats refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often necessarily reports them.
The relationship between North and South -- which is technically still in the war -- has improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenyan to talk about denuclearization.
This happened after the historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Jin in June in Singapore, when they agreed in common terms to work fully out of the Caribbean nuclear weapon.
But on Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea Yan Ho accused American sanctions in the absence of progress since that time.
"Without trust to the United States there will be no assurance in our national security, and under such conditions we will not be going to disarm the first," said Mr. Riya in a speech at the AAN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelozy called Brett Cavano "a hysterical," she says he shouldn't work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the Chamber of Representatives Nancy Pelozy called a candidate at the Bret Cavana Verheu Court and stated that he did not fit for work at the Verheuuard Court.
Palosi said this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Ostina, Texas.
"I couldn't get rid of the idea that if a woman did that to herself, she would be called a "hersister," said Pelozi about her reaction to the Kawano speech before the Senate's Legal Committee on Thursday.
It's been emotionally charged with sexual harassment to Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were still teenagers.
During his lecture, Cavano was very emotional, sometimes even shouting and couldn't talk when his family and the older classes were discussing.
He also strongly accused the democratics in the committee, calling charges against his "gratcal and organised murder", organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential election in 2016.
Palosy stated that he believed that the Cavano speech showed that he could not work in the Military Court, because he clearly showed that he had the advantage of being against the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with his statements and the manner in which he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Palosy prevented when she was asked if she would try to impress Cavano when he was selected and when the Democrats got most of the representatives in the House.
“I will say so – if he does not speak the truth in Congress or in the FBI, he should not only work in the Divine Court, but also in the Court where he works now,” said Palozy.
At this point, Cavano is the judge of the District Court of Appeal of the District of Colombia.
Palozy added that as a member of the Democratic Party, she was concerned about the potential decisions of Cavano against the law on available medicine or in the case of Rowe against Wade, because Cavano was considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing on the testimony of the Cavan's passport, he did not answer the questions, whether he would cancel certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for aesthetic, indiscriminate persons to work in court and expect us to say, 'How wonderful,'," said Palozy.
And a woman must be able to do it.
It's a justified prosecution speech, months and years of anger are just pouring down, and she can't remember it without tears.
"We cry when we're angry." 45 years ago, Mrs. Stein told me.
"I don't think it's that rare."
She continued: "I was very helped by a woman who worked with the director in a certain way, and who said that when she got caught, she was crying, but she was working on a technique of behavior, and when she got caught up and started crying, she said to the interviewers, "Perhaps you think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And she just kept talking.
I think it was great."
The tears are allowed partly as an exit of the sum, because they are absolutely misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories of the first work that I had once cried out of unexplained anger, then I was caught by an elderly woman, the restrained chief, who always frightened me a little, and dragged me to the stairs.
"Never allow them to see you in tears," she said.
"They do not know that you are angry.
They think that you are sad and will be glad to give you."
Patriot Schroeder, at the time the Congressman-Democrat from the state of Calarada, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential company.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt got married on a train called Monkey Business and got out of the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder's very angry thought that she could participate in the presidential company herself.
"It wasn't a very well thought-out solution," she laughed and said 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, and I didn't need them.
Someone called this a "Bellow and Seven Dwarves."
Since the company had been running for quite a long time, it didn't have the resources, so she said it wouldn't take part in the election unless it took $2 million.
It was a bad situation.
It turns out that some of her adherents who sacrificed $1,000 to men gave her just $250.
"They think I'm going with a gun?" she thought.
When she made a statement that she was not going to participate in the election, she was so deeply touched by the emotions – thanks to the people who supported her, the system that made it so difficult to obtain money and targeted the voters rather than the candidates, and the anger of sexism – which took over the breathing.
"You might think that I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Schroeder's reaction to the press on her condition.
"It was possible to think that my corporate sponsor was the producer of Kleenex paper yarn.
Have I ever thought they'd be writing on my supermoulded stone?
"She cried?"
Why a trade war between China and the United States can be good for Beijing
The first wave of trade war between China and the United States was overwhelming, and since war is far from over, in the longer prospect of misunderstandings between countries may be for the benefit of Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump shot the first warning at the beginning of this year, taxing China's main export companies, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week, when the new tariffs covered the total amount of $200 billion (150 billion), actually taxing half of the goods that occur in the United States of America from China.
Each time, Beijing responded in the same way, rising recently from five to ten percent on American ships at $60 billion.
China's fans of the United States are symmetrical, and the second, by the size of the economy, will hardly cause the eye.
To force Washington to retreat, we need to step into demand, but the public tendency towards the U.S. is practically unacceptable to China's leader, Si Xinpina.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes the right use of the situation, the pressure of the U.S. war trade in a distant perspective can sustain China by reducing the interdependence of these two countries.
"The fact that a rapid political solution in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will start a sharp economic downturn, much more dangerous than observers have thought before," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant who specializes in Asia, in the research-analytical centre of new American security.
Grey 'prepared' to return refugees, said the Minister of Foreign Affairs
The Syrian states that he is ready to return to the refugee camp and calls for assistance in the reconstruction of a war-damaged country that has lasted more than seven years.
Referring to the AAN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure, thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The state continues to renew the areas destroyed by terrorists to return to normal life.
Now we have all the conditions for returning refugees to the country that they were forced to leave because of terrorism and targeted economic measures that were directed towards improving their daily lives and means of living.
AAN believes more than 5.5 million orphans have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem stated that the Syrian regime would gladly receive help to rebuild the ruined country.
However, he stressed that the country would not receive help in exchange for certain conditions or assistance from the countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe has won the Battle of Rider in Paris
The European team won Kubak Ryder in 2018, winning an American team with a final number of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National field in the province of Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost six times on European soil and has not won the Rider Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe has won the crown even though the Dutch captain Thomas B'ern's team has won 14.5 points to win over the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who most of all competed in the tournaments, threw his ball into the water for 3 pairs of 16th-holes, setting up this match of Francis Malinara.
The Italian golfer Malinari played well all around, making one of the four players who went through this field with the number 5-0-0 from the beginning of the tournament in the current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Schree was defeated by 5 and 4 players with the lowest ratings in the European team, Tornb'ern Olsen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's most famous player, lost 2 and 1 Ien powderer from England, who was probably playing in his last cup of Riyadh.
A veteran with eight cubes of Rider Spanish Serhia Garcia has become a player who has won more than all of the tournaments with a career of 25.5 points.
"Normally I don't cry, but today I can't be afraid.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas, who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad to return the cube.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad it could help," said the disturbed Garcia after the European team won.
He handed over the esophagus to his countryman John Ram, who on Sunday lost the legend of American golfer Tiger Woods in a single match of 2&1.
"I am very proud of what I have won in Tiger Woods, the man who has been a career for since childhood," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four mothers in France and now my record number is 13-21-3 in Ryder's cube.
The amazing statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 main titles and is left on this indicator only by Jack Niklaus.
The American team fought with themselves, except for Patrick Ryd, Justin Thomas and Tney Finns, who played the whole tournament of high-school golf.
American captain Jim Fury said after a desperate game to protect his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they're the battles.
This morning we sometimes showed Europe what we could do.
We fought.
Let's take off our hats in honor of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the U.S. Gulf Association and our Riyadh Cube Committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Take the hat off before them.
We've been moved."
