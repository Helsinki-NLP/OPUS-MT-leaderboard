I can't explain it to you.
He's afraid of a dog.
There was a lot of girls at the party.
I didn't even know you had a girlfriend.
How did you impress Tom?
What does he hate me for?
Enough to piss him off.
He knows her from high school.
Tom made it look like nothing happened.
I promised myself I'd quit smoking.
Stay here with them.
Avariya didn't cost him his life.
He cut off the bottle.
We're home.
You haven't returned those books yet?
I met him at the club.
I didn't agree.
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
I hope you don't get me back.
Why are you so secretive?
You're just running away from life's problems.
Out of the snow.
When did you see her?
I've been waiting for you for three hours.
I failed the exam.
Eat while it's hot.
That's why it took three hours to sell.
What are you offering me?
Tom thinks Maria's an idiot.
I told you to wait for me.
I couldn't answer all the questions.
I didn't know you were coming, either.
Last week, I hit Boston on Tom.
Tom's beautiful.
Tom didn't know Mary liked to prepare.
I said 'cause you're busy.
Tom was surprised to see Mary in Boston.
You want the anecdotes?
I wanted to do more.
Tom is our best pilot.
Are you sure you know what that means?
I can't just ignore him.
She's riding to school on a bicycle.
I'll pay now!
Would you like to sit down for a role?
I've been busy all day yesterday.
They're equivalents.
There was a coin under the table.
She's empty.
Help the window.
Don't think I didn't try.
You stay here.
Tom risked his life to save Mary.
The caravan of fifty camels was speeding up the desert.
You must be ashamed of your ignorance.
I've been in touch with Tom's place.
Tom went to the park alone.
You're a teacher, aren't you?
I won't try to convince you.
I knew Tom was about to lose.
Tom told Mary he wanted to drink.
Why are you smiling?
Tom didn't say how he was going to get there.
Didn't I tell you that I'm allergic to peanuts?
I know how old you are.
I'm not going to show it to anyone anymore.
Tom won't sell his house.
I didn't mean to make Tom bitter.
I'll teach you.
I have food.
He came to her.
I wouldn't do that.
Tom tried to drown Mary.
I decided to try again.
Tom won't let you win anymore.
The cosmonauts are wearing caphans.
Algeria is buying artillery weapons from Russia.
To tell me about what happened?
I'll give you something.
Why should Tom apologize?
The results were shocking.
This room is empty.
Tom sent Mary a telegram.
Can you believe that?
We spent the night under the open sky.
Don't shut the door.
When are you free?
Didn't Tom have to do that on October 20th?
I have to go to work now.
Who is this woman?
I want to talk to you about this report.
When does it start?
Circumcision is one of five feelings.
What's wrong with you?
They're afraid of him.
Tom at work.
Tom's hiding something from us.
He didn't even touch him.
Have you made a name for a newborn?
I want you to help me with my homework.
I'm not a specialist.
I got cold from him.
I like Brazil, but I'm still going to Ukraine.
I made you breakfast.
I didn't think you'd let me do that.
I'll see Tom almost every day after school.
The Great Burial will correct.
Soup's so hot it can't be.
Why is she so popular?
They declared their innocence.
Where are you so badly hurt?
I don't think they're friends.
I made a deal with Tom.
I thought Tom and Mary were friends.
I was expecting good news from them.
Distilled water is tasteless.
Father's in the garden now.
Harry's working a full day at the local supermarket.
It's unlikely I'm late.
I told them to be in the traps.
Tom said he was totally tired.
I used to dream of being a millionaire.
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.
Tom's planning to break up with his girlfriend.
Where are you tonight?
Tom closed the door in his bedroom.
I've known Tom for a few months.
You're desperate!
Tom plays very well on the script.
No one's accusing you.
The following year is the year of Crolica.
Tom almost always takes the bath before dinner.
I can take you home.
What did you learn?
Please write down what I say.
Now I'm adding the last lines.
I can't forget Tom.
I don't have any books.
Tennis is the only kind of sport Tom has in his possession.
Come to the skeleton.
Let me help you.
I was very tired, so I fell asleep.
Tom is my favorite singer.
Remember that I love you.
As they say, he's a killer.
Mary didn't want to trust Halloween in an open suit, so she decided to dress like a lady-maid.
Tom put the hat on.
Tom's been waiting three hours.
Mary said she didn't want to drink.
You knew Tom better than I did.
Maybe people like us should not have children.
I'm not going to be like that anymore.
I go shopping every morning.
The baby's pushing.
Tom refused to sign the document.
Tom didn't even stop.
I don't want Tom driving anywhere without me.
I've been watching how you do it.
He's got the ability to do math.
Careful, on the way out.
He's a newlywed father.
Men were men at that time.
Swiss banks are very secret.
Once you finish your mission, you can drink as much as you think.
I'm the only one who can help you.
I hate winter.
What do you think Tom will say when he finds out?
Christmas is coming.
You want us to do this together?
All our attempts have been abandoned.
He poured himself another glass.
Please pay attention, I'm now going to go to the patient's hearing, make sure that you have the correctness of the procedure - you will have to use it tomorrow.
Please, salt.
She spent all her money.
Tom slept in the barn.
You're taking your eyes off.
Tom was tall for his age.
Did you notice what Mary had in her mind?
You're gonna be late for school again.
What's your favorite movie star?
That's why I didn't have to ask twice.
You need to come to Boston.
I was moved with joy.
She's rich, young and beautiful.
Do you love your country?
I rarely see you and Tom.
I'm pretty tall.
From a practical point of view, there are many shortcomings.
This is the house I live in.
I'm going to school with him.
It seems to you that you disagree.
Tom didn't kill Mary.
I don't know what I mean.
I went to Harvard.
You're like a sporty plastic.
I can't let him go alone.
It's Tom's window.
Jesus, by allowing rage to enter the flock of swine, demonstrated the continuity of God’s Law on unclean animals.
I'm the captain.
I think we're gonna be okay.
We had to come.
I was wrong about that.
Today is my birthday.
We need to tell people what they need to do.
If she's not precious, I'll buy her.
I told you what to do.
She didn't drown.
It was a good movie.
Are you a promo?
I'll never let you forget it.
Tom told me not to talk to you.
Who were you going to sell it to?
I don't want a divorce.
I grew up in Australia.
Tom gave the will of anger.
The missing boy was known for his clothes.
I've got good reflexes.
Tell me what it looked like.
She's probably refusing to follow his advice because she doesn't like him.
Did you write it down?
I know you're working on them.
I hope I can help you.
Does your parents know about this?
The officer put a white skater on the table.
That day I stayed home because it was raining.
Is there a pharmacy around here?
I read it.
Tell me where I can find her.
Why is Tom looking at me like that?
I called the police and told them that my car was stolen.
We can discuss this later.
That helps a little.
The bones in ancient Egypt were sacred animals.
Can I speak in public?
I work for an oil company.
Why don't you find someone else who needs your help?
Tom applied a wet coat to Mary's orb.
He hurt his left hand.
Is she Italian?
We want to go.
The population of this city is reduced every year.
Dan didn't want to be obsessive.
Couldn't you tell me anything about you?
Did you find the difference between these two photos?
I've never seen so many books gathered in one place.
You look a little depressed.
Don't forget to call me.
She's got a sheer tongue in her pocket.
I would never do that.
Fix him, please.
You need to apply the ice pack to reduce the swelling.
I could show you the city.
I know Tom's sick.
You didn't do anything wrong.
Take another liver.
I want to sleep!
You must be an idiot.
Tom in the park.
I didn't think you'd be here today.
"Who are you people of nationality?" "Argentinians."
Why are you sad?
I can do a lot better than you.
Don't forget!
I really think so.
The sun is breaking.
Tom brought his room in order.
Did you file a complaint?
I don't like Tom very much.
So we're going to have to change our plans.
Someone tried him.
You want to know something else?
Tom said he wanted to see us before he left.
But I don't have the money.
How's your new salary, Mary?
There was fear on his face.
If you don't tell her, I'll tell her.
Can you trust a secret?
My mother died in an accident.
London is the capital of England.
Her mother was a singer.
Should we call her?
I asked Tom to explain.
It's your fault.
Tom told everyone he was adopted.
Tom promised he wouldn't say anything.
Something's changed.
It's not the only key.
Ask Alex.
It's just money.
Take her somewhere.
I was just there when it happened.
Her origin is unknown.
Suck it.
Tom wakes up from a deep sleep.
You're big.
Where did you see him?
I don't know why you want me to do it.
I hope I see him Monday.
Are you sure you want to sell your father's guitar?
There's no girl on the Internet.
They'll find you.
I'm trying to figure out why this happened.
We'll send them an opening.
If you don't want to answer, you don't have to.
Look to the left and the right before crossing the road.
Tom was my friend, too.
I didn't know her then.
We've heard these promises before.
What did you and Tom do after dinner?
I'm very unhappy.
As often as that happens, Mike is late for the meeting today.
Tom told me that Mary had a new boyfriend.
We won't let that happen.
These fools violated the law prohibiting the violation of the law.
It's not done yet.
John spoke so loud that I heard him on the second floor.
Tom checked his vision.
I didn't give it to Tom.
That's weird.
I know you're rich.
Bill put a hundred dollars on his way.
He served in the fleet.
Who taught you to dance?
Tom's got a nose.
I wouldn't be surprised.
Seriously, I'm not.
You knew them better than I did.
None of us want this to happen.
How much more wine to buy?
I won't waltz.
He sat in the car and left.
Tell me about everything that happened here.
I'm looking for my phone.
He shared his soup with me.
All models are wrong, but some are useful.
I don't have time to do my homework.
It's a big step forward.
Pray for me, Tom.
We still don't know the side effects of this medicine.
Tom's got a toothache for three days.
You seem to know everyone here.
Hope dies last.
That's the girl who came in yesterday.
I'll give you a new one.
You said it was yours.
Where did he buy those boots?
Don't make me do it.
Why are you laughing?
Tom usually goes to work on the bus.
Fadel went to school.
I've been working with Tom before.
Tom and I are partners on the team.
Leave him alone!
My heart beats more every time I see her.
Do I think so?
Everyone's got a hat, except Tom.
She gives him everything he asks.
Is it sold?
I'm getting worse.
Do you have that much bigger?
It's legal.
Do you like your name?
We can't afford to buy a new car.
That only exacerbates the problem.
Tom told me he saw Mary tonight.
Tom heard the sound of a snoop in the bathroom.
I called the door.
Tell him I'm sick.
They're gone.
Can you take your car for a while?
You can't stay here all day.
I saw Jessie standing there.
They're very close.
You're wet.
There's some sugar in the package.
That's what I did when I was a kid.
Something really good happened today.
What are you talking about?
Don't go into any other business.
Who's in the blue football?
Tom's got an American accent.
I don't have the money to buy a dictionary.
Why are you so surprised?
It's good to see you.
I want you to tell me everything.
She looks good for her age.
If I knew her address, I'd write her a letter.
She kept herself married.
We need to talk to them.
I'd like to talk to you.
Tom took care of it.
It's the third one now.
The lion is strong.
I needed to make sure he was coming here.
She said she didn't know the rules.
Education is one of the most important aspects of life.
The boy fixed the hat.
Maybe we're having a party?
He's capable of math.
I'm glad you told me about her.
He's afraid of the cat.
I hear you're playing a good gang game.
Did you read them?
I said 'cause I'm not gonna help him.
Tom's sorry he left Boston.
I don't like this store.
Tom speaks more French than he does.
I don't remember how much I paid for it.
You're not eating with us?
Tom lives in Australia with his wife and three children.
I could barely sit on the train.
I don't like to argue.
You like science fiction movies?
I'll make her happy.
Just tell him I called.
I don't want to get up.
His home behind the hill.
It was Sunday, and I didn't get up early.
What a lunch!
Mary, are you in a good shape now?
I made a mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom made 20 cuts.
I'm sure you can handle the job.
After Mary gave the encouragement, she poured a bottle of wine through him, and she went out of the restaurant with a hard walk, and a dead silence ensued.
You're young Tom for two years.
We've met them.
Tom's gonna have a good time tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary alone.
You don't mind, do you?
I think you'll need a loan.
Tom's father, in prison, never writes Tom.
It's expensive.
I haven't heard from him in a hundred years.
I didn't know Tom couldn't swim.
I thought we all had a long time to meet.
Everyone's interested in Japan.
Tom's getting out of here very easily.
Please, just do everything like me.
Stay there.
I disagree with him.
That's what it's called success.
It was so dark in the room that I had to go through a hole.
How many planes in the U.S. Army?
Is she your teacher?
Get back together, Tom.
What are you hiding from me?
Tom realizes he doesn't need it anymore.
Tom was in the garden.
The young plants are placed in the bush in winter.
I have French.
If that sounds too good to be true, it's probably not true.
Leave it where he found it.
Tom had to tell Mary.
Why is everybody looking at me?
Tom kissed Mary yesterday.
I'm not afraid of him.
I'm very proud of my father.
I told you it would work.
It all seems so strange.
Tom decided to go.
You've taught me a lot.
How long are you sleeping?
Bring in the garbage.
Tom apologized to the audience.
Tell Mary I have her keys.
Did you buy some candles?
Canada is a hockey family on ice.
The brain is a very complex organ.
They'd agree.
Your Japanese good.
We're going through a window.
The spiders are disgusting little things.
I want to know where it is.
Kiss without lips like soup without salt.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where are the others locked up?
That's all that happened today.
I saw the car hit a man.
We accepted their invitation.
Tom worked with Mary.
I'm tired of dying.
You know what your kids are doing now?
You want her to stay?
He misses her.
Please tell me I'm right.
We saw the castle in front of us.
Tom kept kicking her.
Six goes in front of the family.
Today I went to the grave of my grandfather.
Tom couldn't believe someone was trying to kill him.
Tom didn't dance with Mary.
I saw a man who ate from a garbage dump yesterday.
I think Tom lied to me.
She took me under her wing.
Tom and Maria stopped laughing when they noticed John crying.
I have to meet Tom.
Tom lost his thumb.
Did you sign the contract?
I said 'cause he needs to talk to a lawyer.
They're not on that bus again?
Let Tom go home.
I'm not hungry either.
He's got a lot of company.
This area has changed completely.
Tom's anti-Semitic.
What is your strongest side?
Tom doesn't like it when they push him.
Interestingly, when Angelica Agurbash sang a song on the words of Nekleeva, could she imagine that he would be bowling in the presidents?
There's yogurt in the fridge.
Can you tell us what's going on?
Tom's always being honest.
Foma's got to be there by two thirty.
Show me Boston on the map.
Tom said he was extremely tired.
Tom wasn't in his room?
Why aren't you looking for him?
They survived, even though the building was destroyed.
I don't want anything better.
Tom wants a popcorn.
My favorite restaurant burned down.
John's not being careful, he's making a lot of mistakes.
Tom took Mary's interview.
Tom is my personal assistant.
Who's this guy?
Keep your children away from the wig.
Let's talk about it tonight.
I have to do it.
They don't know French.
Take it!
I knew what Jacksons were doing.
You don't have to apologize to me.
Tom and Mary have one granddaughter and three granddaughters.
He wants peanut butter.
You're so lucky.
Tom's getting a little drunk.
I barely understood him.
He ran away from the hostages.
You can live in a large house and still not feel naked.
I expect Tom to tell me what to do.
I'll see him tonight.
One plus one is two.
Red's better.
The universe is endless.
I'm not ready to do this yet.
Thank you for your visit.
What did you mean?
I wanted to spend more time with you.
Can you tell me about Tom?
Can I have Tom for a few words?
Don't sound like that.
When was Tom arrested?
We're going to six.
The olive has become a victim of the lion.
Tom didn't want to go.
Tom's a little younger than your daughter.
I did everything I could to save Tom.
Try to get her to help us.
Are you with us?
Contaminate your wishes.
Tom's alive.
It may be in the water for ten years, but it won't be a crocodile.
Tom made a point that he didn't understand that Mary was trying to tell him.
I saw how it happened.
I don't think there can be any other reason than that.
I'm very happy now.
My apartment was robbed last week.
How do you always get to be so energetic?
Put your signature here.
What an ego!
So you bought it?
The man is as old as he is, and the woman as she looks.
Wisdom comes with age.
Remember what you told me?
There's been a lot of snow in the last year.
He tried to cross the river.
Everything seems to be nice.
Tom told Mary to tell the truth.
You don't want another daughter?
I like to play along the river.
You can come with me.
This word is a great gift for us.
"How long before dinner?" "Five minutes."
Tell her.
Mary spent all her time at work.
Tom sat on his motorcycle and took him.
Did you ever have to live in Scandinavia?
Can I open my eyes now?
I don't want to play cards.
I want to keep working here.
I live in Latvia.
I've been waiting for him till ten.
Tom usually says the first thing in his head.
Why do you want to leave?
How's it going to be more French?
It wasn't worth it.
What about the computer?
We were both busy.
I'm fine.
We're not going to fire you.
You really think Tom can swim?
How are you going to spend so much money?
Mary likes to hang out with bad guys.
It is often said that the world is going to disappear in one language each week.
She has a little advantage.
I thought we talked about it.
How sad my parents would have been if I had failed.
I feed the basket every morning and every evening.
Hold your tongue, you won't get it.
You must take into account all the consequences before you make any changes to the existing code.
I can't bite.
I think you did great.
Last night, we had a lot of rain.
What did Tom bring?
That's exactly what I was looking for.
Tom noticed that the door was open.
That's when I hurt my granddaughter.
I'll tell you more about him.
What choice did I have?
You should stay upstairs.
Come home early, Bill.
She sat on the table and read the magazine.
From this point on, it's forbidden to cry.
If I knew that, I'd tell you.
This is where he lived.
I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to the hangar.
Eat my chocolate? Don't even think about it!
Beautiful in white, the house looks bigger.
I had difficulty finding the original quote.
I had no idea you were familiar with her.
What's the point of doing this?
Which dog is yours?
You have to give it more time.
You didn't tell me what Tom said in French.
Tom is returning to Boston next week.
Why don't you help me?
I watched a movie in French with English subtitles.
I'll eat.
In my opinion, Tom played well.
He only blames others, and he never does.
You guys can play a gang?
Tom came to Mary and hugged her.
"When are you coming back?" "It depends on the weather."
How many turtles do they live?
How safe is it?
Your message has been received.
It took me three years to complete my house.
I was upset.
Don't talk to your mother like that.
We'll see if we can do that.
Tom didn't want us to attend his party.
I just realized what was going on.
She said she'd be late.
Your parents still live in Germany?
I need her today.
Tom, he'll probably win.
What do you want Santa to bring you?
Why doesn't Tom want to see me?
Where's your spirit of adventure seeker?
What are you mad at me for?
You can leave if you want.
I see you've already met.
Something tells me you're right.
It's not my cat.
The captain ordered his men to shoot.
Sit down there.
He hasn't done it yet.
Tom became a father.
Tom's been asked about my daughter.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
It's hard to be a woman, to think like a man, to act like a lady, to look like a girl and to work like a horse.
Let me talk to her first.
I tried to convince her, but I couldn't.
I thought you were Canadian.
Why are you sitting on my chair?
Sounds simple.
I can't afford to buy it.
I've never seen you in a trap.
Put him on the pole.
I thought you found someone else.
On this road there is always a huge number of vehicles.
You lied to all of us.
I don't think Tom has any brothers or sisters.
He must love you.
To pretend foolishly that you make me believe that I believe in what you don't believe!
I think that would be a big mistake.
Tom and Mary have a son.
I've been forgiven.
I appreciate your support.
You think that's possible?
In the end, he's sick.
You think Tom's locked?
If that's true, she's better than me.
I'll take good care of Tom.
Tom, looks like he didn't recognize you.
I refuse to help Tom.
Can I sit with her?
Leave him alone.
Are you reading anything other than the Bible?
Read me the statement of the accountant in the cat.
What does this gentleman do for his life?
Why do you think that's why you like it?
Your parents know that?
Is that what they're talking about?
Tom's waiting for you at the conference room.
The main thing in Tatoeb is not to say thoughts above your stomach and below your knees.
He paid him four dollars.
I had to cancel my trip because of the ambush.
I don't know your name.
How many trains are coming to Boston?
What are the words of this song?
Mary likes to hate her brother.
The law on my side.
So we had to find where he lived.
Tom was with Mary all morning.
The publication of the article was given on the day of the Professor's birth.
You had a phone call several times while you were in the spirit.
She went out for him because of the money.
No bird can sing.
I bought him a magazine.
I don't think Tom hates you.
Tom doesn't respect them.
It's just superstition.
Tom must make his own decisions.
Count, please.
Your shoes must always be clean.
You're on your birthday soon.
Take care of it.
I don't like those boots.
Tom had been married to Mary for a long time.
It's just a picture I jumped on the Internet.
I think that's why less than thirty.
Have you had a drink?
No doubt, he is the best suited for this work.
You're making my work easier.
Tom said he saw Mary do it.
Tom can't just leave.
I love it.
You don't seem to be very busy.
Delleen's gone.
You look a lot like me.
You know from those men?
Tom came out of the room, didn't tell anyone a word.
That probably didn't happen.
Have you finished the chain yet?
Tom and Mary talked for no less than an hour.
I want you to stay with us.
He was trying to save her.
If you push this button, the door will open.
How much do you need?
I'm back to help you.
Tell me more about them.
Did you hear the last words?
I'd show you how it's done.
I asked Tom to come.
You've got a steak.
Mom taught me not to waste money.
We could walk.
She ended up yesterday at the second half of the day.
I can't grow our daughter alone.
He took a seat for me.
I wanted to talk about it.
I yelled for help.
Can you explain your answer?
I know it's important to you.
They all knew her.
We'd better stop.
I'm not gonna be late anymore.
I'm terribly hungry.
I live close enough for you.
Tom tends to the horses.
Why doesn't Tom agree with you?
I have to go back to Australia.
Usually people die if they're killed.
They locked Tom out of the life insurance unit.
I didn't know what I was talking about.
I'm sorry about my French.
What did I do now?
Tom and Mary have a lot in common.
Tom wants to go to the beach.
They won't let me go.
They wouldn't tell me the truth.
We always tell each other.
I've never been satisfied.
Tom's got two of you.
Tom closed the roof.
I'll marry a lawyer.
Another interesting source of energy is heat that can be obtained from radioactive waste.
He's smarter than me.
Why did you say that first?
Your grandmother is a charming lady.
He wouldn't dare do that.
The 12-hour trip has been confusing me.
The baby woke up in the middle of the night.
I said I was tired.
Who's the boss of this company?
Nobody saw us do it.
He came back two days later.
Tom was in the morning.
We need to be home soon.
When did you move to Boston?
I know Tom and Mary have been asked.
Eda!
So you helped wash the window?
It's out of my jurisdiction.
It was yesterday.
I'm starting to love myself.
Who wants to be your son when he grows up?
I'm too busy here.
Don't tell me what really happened.
I'm not just gonna give you this.
What are you gonna say?
Did you talk about your hobby?
Get down here.
Why can't I see her?
I showed my friends these openings.
Tom didn't realize he made a mistake.
I dropped the ball.
I'm a singer.
Tom apologized to us.
He read this book yesterday.
Where did Tom find this photo?
Tom gave me both the money and the advice.
What do you want to hear from me?
Please open the door.
Tom said he doesn't want to sleep yet.
She married him at the age of 20.
I can't give anyone that word.
Give me that box.
They say his father died in a foreign country.
Take mine.
I know Tom's above Mary.
I didn't have time to do that today.
Mary said that she would help him.
Multiplicity of ‘person’ is ‘people’, not ‘persons’.

Tom thinks I'm in Boston right now.
Tom didn't want to buy a new car.
We're teachers.

I found this book interesting.

I'll be late.
Your children know French?
Tom yelled and ran out of the room.
This soup gives you fish.
There's a lot of girls in your room.
He's talking too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in the coffee.
You didn't know I was teaching French in Boston before?
Tom was very surprised.
They were trying to make time.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, who lived among the people, spoke dreadfully, in the eyes of the Jews, the Galileo dialect of the Aramaic language instead of the irritant, thus showing the inability of allegations of the existence of any sacred language, which is especially close to God in prayer.
Tom changed his mind.
My opinion is slightly different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
That's why they paid three hundred dollars for it.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom will do.
Weather forecast is not correct.
Tom obviously doesn't know anyone.
I'll ask Tom to prepare you something to eat.
I'll go find Tom.
I don't have any more books.
I want you to read this book.
Tom didn't wear a tie.
That's my answer!
I heard him sing in his soul.
You remind me of a young man.
Tonight, Tom's on duty.
I'm always busy.
I'm playing for the piano a little bit.
I thought you were a ghost.
Tom got up fast.
Please tell everyone I'm sorry.
Tom told me to stay in my room.
I've taken a break.
Have you called Lucy yet?
A good idea came to her head at the last minute.
In this room, there's a lot of air.
Why aren't you in the sweater today?
Pound is a weight unit.
I wouldn't talk to him in your place anymore.
Japan consumes a lot of paper.
It's very difficult.
You betrayed me.
Tell her I'm sick.
Tom, looks like he's very busy.
And I'm so glad to meet you.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
I can't help it.
Is that my book?
Strika is a routine job.
Who else do you have on the list?
So don't give me my phone.
I've already decided who I'm going with.
I'd like to know what to tell them.
Tom's kids must miss him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you should talk to them.
He's reading physics in Oxford.
He hid this fact from me.
Is that what you saved me?
He's been horribly snoring in his sleep.
What's your favorite browser?
Tom recognized Mary by the voice.
You don't even look at me.
Tom's too lazy to do that.
Please stop arguing.
Grandpa always said there would be days like today.
I didn't tell her that.
I want to live in Australia.
No one could help them.
When did you meet her?

We should get to know each other better.
Someone said something, but I didn't get it.
Someone needs to talk to him.
I never worried about them.
Tom was able to get to the hospital on his own.
I sat next to Tom.
Your voice is upset.
You've always been so egotistical?
I think this medicine will be of great benefit to you.
Tell him to be here by half a third.
It's not a god who knows what science is.
Tom suspected that Mary was using drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you don't need to talk to her.
I'm afraid it'll rain.
Would you like a beer?
Where did you see him?
The poor cat was on the brink of a famine.
I've learned so much about my mistakes that I'm thinking about doing a few more!
My favorite color is blue.
I've made some corrections.
You don't know what you're talking about.

Where do you want to go for the next exits?
How wonderful is that?
I'm tired.
Tom wasn't hanging out with Mary.
Get out of my office.
This car's a good sale.
I need to work on these exits.
You can't do that to us.
His words bothered me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know that's why I had to.
Give her my regards.
Was that a lie?
Tom's answer to everyone's shock.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom in return?
It's time for me to go.
Where was your son?
I saw it in the store.
Peace is cruel.
I've got a good dream.
That's why no one cares about anything but themselves.
I'm from Sydzuoka.

Don't forget us.

Tom yells at Mary.
It's my favorite song.
Do not leave the active engine.
I don't know what's in the box.
Tom kind of said that Mary from Australia.
She knows you?
Tom was arrested in October 2013.
You're very smart.
Again and again, there are obstacles in our lives, some call them problems, others speak of opportunities for growth.
Thank you for taking him on a fishing trip.
You won't have that problem.
I prefer to spend time with friends.

If I had the money, I'd buy a computer.
Tom smiles?
She went to Paris.
Tom's in school right now?
Please let us know.
Tom snuck in and went to the door.
It was just a joke.
Try proving I'm wrong.

Do you have any pain?
He couldn't leave because of a lack of money.
Let me explain how this works.
Open the door, or we'll break it!

I brought the oven.
The following year, Tom will teach French.
I heard it all the time.

I heard that phrase on the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her in the arm.
You don't speak French?

I'm sorry he did this without you.
You have blood coming out of your nose.

We can't just ignore that.
Where did you and Tom meet?
Where's the nearest supermarket?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't know Mary.
I don't think I like it.
Even if you are a liar, join in.
Tom wanted to ask Mary for forgiveness again.
Tom's been thinking about it.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I can't swim.
He never was.
I really want to go with you, but I can't.
It's never been like that before.

Let's go faster, and you'll be late for school.
Have you ever written a book?

Mary took Alice's new plate.
It was difficult to make that decision.

I got what you asked for.
He said he'd do it.
That's why I didn't have to leave.
Mary got better after the illness.
I didn't know where you were.
Where did Tom get this?
Eating meat is harmful to your health and your environment.
You're telling me you don't know anything about this?
What's your plan, Tom?
Tom can't get the pleasure of life.
I want you to say a word for me.
I don't like anyone.
I'm sorry I don't know Tom's phone.
"Tom in the course." "Yes, you told him?" "No, he knew it all."
Your explanation was very understandable.

I don't see any difference.
What are you studying?

Someone's not enough.
I'll tell her myself.
When are you leaving?
Look, don't hesitate.
The mountain is green.
I have my own theory.
I just had a conversation with your teacher.
I'm used to sleeping early.
Don't you think I'd help you?

Why are you so direct?
Go to your father and ask him.
You still want to go?
The teacher wrote a brief comment on each letter.
It's hard for you to take seriously.
The tribes moved along the river.
I'll do it.
I said let them go.
When did it start?
No one cares what she thinks.
I don't think that's weird.
"Where did you get my phone?" "Tom gave."
When are you gonna take the wheat off?
Tom told Mary he was willing to do it.
Does that make sense?
Why are you closing the door?

We can try.
Give it to her.

I love traveling around the world.
Tom understands.
Tom's not tall, but strong.
It's cold this morning, isn't it?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She made dinner.
Please find Tom.
He'll give it to you.
This proposal is not clear.
What would you do?
He's gone to the crowd.
What, you don't understand what's going on?
I'm glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
You think you're fat?
Tom married Mary last year.

Are you happy?
It's not gonna happen.
I'll order it later.
You didn't know Tom was going to Boston?
It's our school.
I've been free all day yesterday, and I work today.
Take your coat.
If you think about it, I really need a cell phone.

Let me talk to Tom.
Last summer they went to a mountain resort.
You're not going to tell me where the nearest church is?
Stay out of here.

Can you come closer?
She's slowing down.
What kind of action do you expect from Tom?
She seemed quite calm.
Push the button.
Tom went to the museum with Mary.
Tom was intrigued by what's happening.
Mary carried the frogs to her knees.
It's a lie.
I'll follow them.
She said she was cold.
The road inspector was extremely rude.
Tom wants to follow his father's feet.
I don't see any problems here.
I don't have to do this tomorrow.
He lost his sunglasses.
It's awfully bitter.

The network is huge.
You got me!
In my view, we should pay greater attention to the current situation.
I know what you told her.
I just fell asleep after two hours of night.
Mary did not suffer from thirst.
So it was not as difficult to sleep as he thought.

Tom said he wasn't waiting for permits.
It's time to finish.

My house is not far from here.
I don't care about money.
There are no invincibles.

Are you having fun?
The man was sentenced to death.
Was it snow yesterday?

I'm trying to solve the problem.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.

I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
The power in Tom's hands.
I learned to do and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me for?
Nobody's gonna blame you.
I'm not busy right now.
Children like to play more than to learn.

What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Guess which language I speak.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My boyfriend's a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who insist on politics.
Is it red or white?
We're not afraid of fear.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
I'm going!
Do it until it's dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.

Bring your wife.
What, are you in a fashion all of a sudden?
Tom said he wouldn't want to spend so much time on it.
You're bitter.
Our granddaughter was born last night.
Tom's suit is the pirate.
It's pure truth!
Let's go get some straw.

It's my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom must be here for 15 minutes.
Tom hopes that Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll get you.
We are proud of our achievements.
That's why Mary had to be invited.
Tom had to be punished.
You're adorable?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not a girl.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I'm going out every day.
She became a postman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop beating the cat!
What were you going to say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime have you committed?
How do we know that this man is the one for whom he betrays himself?

You have to get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last few days have been very hot.
He's wearing a black coat.
I forgot to pollinate the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
Then Tom never saw Mary.
You can't be in this room.
Did you have any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.

His bag was badly damaged.
He got hurt when he fell.
We're impartial.

I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you following your weight?
Tom's playing trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I want her not to be in my house.
You probably can't do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.

Do you have any idea?
Do you like these spirits?

Put it down, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come with us to Boston.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I've got a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Maria.
They want the best.
Tom works as an officer.
Tonight's gonna be cold.
She says she'll be waiting for us.
Why do so many suffer from self - esteem?
Was it too simple?
What Alice faced, waiting for the answer, was a sudden war, it was a loud noise, it was so sharp to break her drums, and it was so loud to reach heaven.
I lost him in the crowd.
We talked about Jim when he went into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to leave his job.
That's why you can't go there.
Tom helped Mary bring things in the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did was wrong.
A lot of books are published every year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked for.
What do you hate her for?
My steering car broke down.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I've been trying very hard to solve the problem.
You should have done your homework.
I spoke on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This rock was so heavy I couldn't lift it.
Why didn't Tom sleep?
The way it wakes up, the way it wakes up.
We took the canoe.
Have you ever tasted banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom remarkable?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look at the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his zont.
How do we explain it to the kids?
I didn't even know your names.
The bee went to the tree.
The language I'm learning is very complicated.
Your child can walk.
Is that all Tom's doing?
I'd rather not marry her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm getting married.
Are you really the only one alive?
I told you I'd be back.
Tom's my youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The President is in office for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have?
Couldn't you solve that question?
And Tom and Mary here.
Why would you do that?
In the twenty-storey building.
If you don't go, I won't go either.
You don't know when Tom's coming back, do you?
I don't have a picture of Tom.
Can you wait a minute?
Are you going to give something to that for Christmas?
She won't let him go.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes this singer.
If he were to follow my advice, he would now be a rich man.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There was a strong wind.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to push the parachute.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you are.
We're not as young as Tom.
How much time do you plan to be home tonight?
The sum is empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's as direct as he is.
I think you can put it on.
She knew she wasn't right.
It's so cool!
Tom had a feeling that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I came home, he watched TV.
Tom was talking last night in a dream.
Tom's ready to protect himself.
You're never right.
Don't say that again!
I called him, but I picked up some girl.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell you 'cause you called.
Tom's very strict with the kids.
How are the negotiations going?
He's ready for the worst.
The beginning of history was interesting.
I thought Tom was interested.
I mix mayonnaise with ketchup.
They're always complaining.
Tom's got a little hive.
Did you understand what she said?
You're kind of dissatisfaction.
Don't hurt her.
I'd better stay.
That's why a brilliant idea came to mind.
She's breathing now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this a place of need?
I didn't know why Tom's late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and tidy.
I suspect that's why we have to go to Boston next week.
Don't go to another land.
Tom was terrified.
The face of Tom's beautified.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stop?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How's your new class?
You're afraid of your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept for him; he always had enough food.
The hall needs a new yard.
Can you stay with them?
Tom came early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, there was rain yesterday.
Looks like he's asleep.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of the crisis?
How far do you want to go?
She had legs.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to discuss something important for both of us.
We need to take you to the hospital.
What's the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom did it a lot.
I hope we don't do that anymore.
How many times have you helped to do that?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These precious treasures.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get it, it's time to open up.
I'm not sure what size she has.
He was also good to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the bell and walked into the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll leave as soon as the rain stops.
Foma's gone from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't think of Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary had been widowed.
Who doesn't admire them?
We cried with him.
You don't want to try again?
Wait a second.
What'd you break up for?
You can make oil, cheese and a lot more from milk.
You don't have the authority to do this.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you her relative?
When you drink water, don't forget the one who's been drinking the well.
Did you know Tom had a son?

I wanted you to win.
I felt like an uninvited guest.
Are you popular?

He's in the middle of an answer.
Tom said Mary was enough.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You'll get it if you try.
You didn't mean to ask Tom for help?
Try standing up.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Couldn't you say that in human language?
No one was hungry except me.
Tom's very excited.
No snowdrop in the snowdrop is considered to be a fault.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I'm going to solve this problem.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When's the shop open?

Try to stay positive.
I've had it all wrong.
She suffocated him with a pillow.
Look at him.
Is it gonna hurt?
The girl had a big red hat.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom's been cheated.
I called you here to ask you a question.
Who are you playing with?
I need a light coat.
I'm done with my job.
It's a cat.
Please tell me it's not true.
You're not coming in?
I repaired his radio.
That's a very bad idea.
Tom is above you.
Tom found work without work.
This book in public access?
Please, can't you talk louder?
I'll tell him to contact Mary.
I helped them.
He looks like a girl.
Please address me, not like Jacob Matveevich.
She's not alone anymore.

You did it on purpose!
You won't need it.
Tom rarely goes to parties.
You're not my mother.
Tell them we're going.
I look like a guy who wants to marry?
I closed the door, but I didn't lock it.
So you should be careful not to kiss Mary publicly.
Can we help them?
Thank you for calling me back.
They're happy.
Please don't be so harsh with me.
Now I'm in charge of the council!
People, good for us all year.
I'm not sorry.
I know Tom won't give up.
I don't really like her.
He's gone.
You're very smart.
Tom and I are planning on getting married on 20 October.
She thought I'd cheat on her.
I'm living in Boston now.
Tom brought his secret to his grave.
You really want to put your money in that bank?
I don't think anyone else wants to do this.
We're teachers.
I'm sure you like me very much.
Why are you so worried about her?
I'll never do it again.
Are there any comers?
Emily wants to be an electrician.
These books are better than those.
Do not try to memorize every sentence in the text, it is almost impossible.
He's been teaching French for eight years.

Tom paid Mary a very decent salary.
What do you think?
Let's have a quick breakfast.

I thought you were right.

Where's Tom's keys?
Am I right to say your name?
No one saw her leave the room.
Wa-bank.
Tom will never find him.
All women are the same.
He allowed them to play in the garden.
I don't have a crusade.

I'm a married man.
He bought his son a camera.
Shut up and eat.
I gave you everything.
I dedicate this song to you.
I like her more.

You've got time.
I'm not coming.
Tom doesn't spend much time thinking about money.
That's why we should go with Mary.
It's interesting what Tom's doing here.
You can't.
I don't think I can go faster.
Tom's got questions left.
Are you looking for someone?
Tom's hand tasted the murena.
That's why we didn't have to hide.

Didn't I warn you not to go there?

It's not a bug, it's a bug.
You got a car problem?
At the tourist information centre, the map of the city was given to all those who wished.

She's in the hotel right now.
What's going to happen to me?
He was so interested that he paid attention to it.

In our library a lot of children's books.

I hate driving.
They're fake.
When you're back, I'm gone.
Did you talk to him today?
I thought you stopped seeing him.

Actually, his name wasn't Tom Jackson.
Is that sarcasm?
Don't do what you'll regret.
Do you envy her?
I hope I can stay here for a long time.
Payments will be made according to experience and education.
I think Tom's right.
You don't have to do sports.

I thought I wouldn't stay.
I can't wait for you and your family.
Did you change her?
I told you I changed my mind.
Why did you say that?
You have to work hard if you want to succeed.
There's no exception in the esperant.
If you need help, say it.
Can I go home early today?
You wouldn't survive for anything.
Tom didn't think Mary would ruin it.
There's a trade area nearby.
Mary thinks she's the smartest.
Use your fist.
Tom doesn't know exactly where Mary lives.
I remember you.
It's interesting news.
Tom is a bitter drink.
We don't even know her.
Tom made a few suggestions and checked them out on Mary before hitting Tatoab.
I know where you keep your money.
The school's finally over.
It's a long drive.

What are you doing here?
Something's bothering him.

Firemen couldn't hold fire.
Help finally came.
It's a horse.

I had no idea you could do that.
Tom's been unloading the car.
Tom knew about Mary something John didn't know.
No answer.
We need to call him.
Are you busy?
I raised my head negatively.
Tom, they're calling you.
You promised you wouldn't drink tonight.
Are you ready for tomorrow?
We checked.
Come and see what Tom's doing in the garage.
I don't think that's how it works.
I didn't do that.
Tom told me he'd come back.
How long are you coming tomorrow?
Open box.
Did you talk to Tom about this?
Is that a flying mouse?
She'll take you to the airport.
Tell me what else I need to know.
You can't make me marry you.
That's pretty weird.
The leaves are yellow.
I woke up, and she's not.
We have a lot of food today.

Why don't you go with her?
Why didn't you just tell them?
I can't rule it out.

I need to get back to Boston.
Sit down, please.
Wake up, Tom.
Here's the map.
You should have stayed with us.
Let's imagine we're inplanetian.

I have nothing to say to you.
I'd rather you didn't tell me about it.

She was only on the train just to be late for the train.

Are you a pig?
I went to the army.
Why can't you take me as I am?
The bear is black.
Tom doesn't know what Mary did.
I don't know who's gonna be at the meeting.
It's hard for the president to come.
If you're hungry, eat.
I was terribly scared.
He's no longer a member of our club.
I'll do it right away.
I don't trust her.
Six is equal to eighteen.
‘Scala’ is an anagram of ‘please’.
I've never seen Tom help anyone.
Dan took part in a meeting against racism.
You did it fast.
I'm gonna have to spend two minutes in advance.
He's on her side.
I didn't forget your betrayal.
I think you did great.
She danced so gracefully that she surprised all of us.
This is where she worked as a secretary.

Her manner of speaking makes me nervous.
Eat what he likes.
And then what happened?
Do you think he likes me?
Tom agreed to help Mary do that.
He prefers not to talk about it.
I let them sleep until noon.
I just wanted to go back to my old life.
I'm sorry she yelled at you.
I've already told you everything you think you know.
Health gives a person freedom, which most people do not realize until it is released.
Does that matter?
I know Tom's secret.

That's not surprising.
The rabbit's got blood coming out of his ear.
Postmodernism differs from modernism.
I've already read this book.
Damn it!
He's showing great enthusiasm.
Maybe you should call the police.
Did you report this to the police?
You really think Tom's sick?
I'm not afraid of that at all.
I don't have much money you think.
I'm selling clothes on the Internet.
I could've done it faster when I was a kid.
I wasn't worried.

You'll know him?
I was, in general, anyway.

I didn't have to come here.
Don't make such an acid face!
The white one?
Tom came first.
The strange stories were about them.
That's amazing.
The sky is covered with battles.
This bird is under threat of extinction.
You've made her very happy.
How do you live?
Like Tom, he felt like he was having fun.
I'm all tied up in my throat.
You said it was important.
He said he'll be back right now.
They have a lot of information.
Everyone in the village called her Green Shapeck.
I don't want to.
It's time to put the kids to sleep.
This work can be done.
I've had a lot of time to rest.
Tom won't object.
It's okay.
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.
Did you take the medicine?
Many people believe in the corruption of officials of our country.
Did he take his pants off?
I can't distinguish him from my brother.
We can count on it.
I'll go with her.
Did the phone wake you up?
I really need someone to bite.
I don't think Tom has any experience.
Come on.

Pets allowed.
Tom's half-hope.
He spoke French, as well as of course English.
Get that rock out of here, please.
"He's getting married." "And who's the lucky picker?"
I've been thinking about you all day.
It's good news.
I can't pay you.
That's what I found in the cave.
I think I made an impression on him.
The train will be at this station for about two minutes.
Grow up, Tom.
I want to sleep with your wife.
What do you think would be the safest place?
I know your father.
I heard you scream.
He's the guy who drew this picture.
"Call up" means calling on the phone.
Who'd notice?
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.
Do you have a question?
They went into the woods.
I'm talking too much.
You show me the way.
Light shines the sun.
The coral reefs are alive.
Tom said he knew that Mary was planning to do it.
You never wanted to talk about it.
We hope for the best.
I didn't expect Tom and Mary to be here.
Last night the temperature dropped below zero.
"You cannot carry it." "Why not?"
Tom did a bad job.
I knew Tom wasn't in Australia.
My eyes are the ocean in which my dreams are reflected.
In a big city like Tokyo, I prefer walking, not driving.
As it turned out here, it's not possible to know now.
Now Tom has his own room.
I didn't know her first.
A large number of votes were produced.
You lied to us, didn't you?
I don't think Tom can help you right now.
He'll probably be here soon.
He didn't really realize that this was a differential equation.
I know that's probably it.
Be an adult, Tom.
Can you distinguish Tom from his twin brother?
I don't get paid for it.
Tom had to clean up the sex boards by breaking them.
Don't make it up to me.
How did you know where Tom was?
She says she'll do it on Monday.
Tom's too fast.
The popularity of the phone has led to fewer people writing letters today.
I think we're almost ready.
The woman came to our town three years ago.
So you're not going to help us?
My puppy died, and I'm terribly upset.
She's above the sister.
I have a pink car.
So quiet.
In the most beautiful colors are the sharpest spikes.
You better hide.
Tom's in line.
That's just not gonna happen.
They can't afford it.
What colors do you like?
She says she feels very tired.
It doesn't matter.
Tom had a happy childhood.
I just got back from Boston.
Why did Tom run away?
Tom doesn't know what Iraq is different from Iran.
That's why they told me not to.
Two days ago, I caught a cold.
I was waiting for him.
You don't have to do this.
Let's have a cup of coffee or something.
You have something in your pockets, don't you?
Ask Tom, he'll tell you the same thing.
I saw that helicopter myself, and I took it by the hand.
I'm with you.
You want to end up like him?
I thought about him.
I'm waiting for someone.
Are you going to the theater tonight?
You have to protect yourself.
There's no conditioner in my house.
Tom and Mary are studying French together.
My boss is very happy today.
They blocked his proposal.
I admire your courage.
Tom hoped that Mary would stay in Boston for a while.
Don't make me do this again.
Soon your turn, Bashar!
You're worthless.
It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
I visited Boston.
I'm sorry, couldn't you repeat the question?
What do you think they're doing to Tom?
Ask Tom when Mary's gonna do it.
I don't want anyone to.
Tom's gonna be working on these exits.
Give her the phone, please.
No one could see us.
I knew I'd find you with Tom.
The President's efforts to put in place more stringent arms control were accompanied by powerful weapons lobbys.
I think we know each other.
You're underestimating Tom.
Don't worry, Tom.
I'll try to express it in English.
Give it to me, please.
We need to talk to her.
Time is enough for you.
We should have been more careful in planning.
You need to sleep.
I'm proud of my father's good fortune.
Anything else you want to tell me?
Foma tried to explain the situation to Masha.
I told her it was a mistake.
He's her manager.
Tom didn't have it.
Nobody paid attention to me.
So there were thirteen at the time.
I'm going to Boston on a bus.
Tom wants to try a new shampoo.
Tom grew up in these places.
You have to pay in advance.
Did you make coffee?
You could tell the truth.
She's just thinking about herself.
You usually talk too fast.
We both speak French.
Look at yourself in a suit like that.
Who told you where to find me?
Who likes Tom?
That's definitely not what I wanted.
How did you break your shoulder?
Tom hid the fact that he was in prison.
We're better than Spartacus!
That's how he was celebrating his birthday.
Why did he need it?
It's a capital investment.
It's really bad.
Time didn't catch up with that.
Did I say something funny?
Where's the ring?
Meg didn't even look at me.
You promise?
I know you did it on purpose.
It's time to find out.
I have to call him.
There's a lot to think about.
You've always been a winner.
Network!
I used to live on Park Street.
Try to be there on Monday.
I've already read it.
That's thanks to you.
Until certain conditions are met.
She's not like everything.
Social networks allow you to find a lot of information about a person before you meet him.
What really happened in the last exits in Boston?
What Is the Meaning of Learning?
These Persians aren't very sweet.
I don't think these black Fridays can be pulled out.
I told you everything I had to tell you.
No, I didn't.
Let me pay her.
I can't forgive his lazys.
Tell me you're kidding!
I'm a realist.
I heard Tom was expelled from school.
Tom said he was very lonely.
I didn't tell my friends I was going to Australia.
Kim's four years older than me.
Why aren't you in shape?
Tom just wanted to make sure that's what you meant.
Tom sent his daughter to sleep without dinner.
I'm coming with you.
They've cleaned the streets from the snow.
Tom and Mary have to do this together.
They offered us their help.
Tom was determined to kiss Mashu.
Are you very hungry?
What's going to happen to him?
Tom and I are friends with each other.
Where do you think you're going?
I had blood in my urine.
You can't always win.
It's some kind of celebrity.
Jimmy knows everything about cars.
I've seen them all.
As everyone knows, he's a genius.
The painting hangs on the walls.
Mary said she'd win.
I want this dog.
Tom with you?
The boy is afraid of the dark.
That's why I made dinner.
Russia has become a second superpower.
I'm worried about them, too.
He went to the post office to send a letter.
Drain this powder into a glass of water.
Are you going with her?
Let's take one of those ready-to-be meals that are sold in the car.
Tom tried to kill them.
She says she's happy.
You want to go abroad?
Don't blame the government.
Put him in place.
How did it happen that you knew each other?
Who sent this letter?
Drop the guns.
What happened to the money?
The average rent per apartment in Manhattan is about $40,000 a month.
You won't find them.
Tom is the only one who survived.
Are you going to buy this car?
You're talking like my grandmother.
I don't have any relatives.
Let's see something else.
You think that's the exact translation?
I know Tom kissed Mary.
We both wanted to be there.
So there's nothing here to do.
Try not to worry about us.
Stop here!
You're very helpful.
Don't stop at the door.
You should take his age into account.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forgot you didn't like pizza.

Tom wants you to help him do that.
She's got a very tense schedule.
Tom also speaks more French.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
In the garden, the tiger lilies are warm.
I told her not to.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do it.
We've come to wish you good luck.
Do you remember his name?
Tom put toys in a toy box.
I don't want you to ride.
He said he'd come.
"Doctor, I'm being ignored." "Follower!"
He has one purpose in life: to earn money.
He gave dogs a piece of meat.
Let's write to you.
Uncle Tom couldn't read.
I'm not a doctor, I'm a teacher.
She said she liked him.
Should I go with you?
Give him the microphone.
Tom spent the night at the hotel.
I explained that to her.
Tom's indecisive.
The nuclear baton!
I'll take my leave if it rains.
It's gotta be real.
There's something else I want to talk to you about.
It's the tallest building I've ever seen.
It'll cut my ears.
What are you doing tomorrow night?
Are you a musician?
It's been ten years since my mother died.
The mixture of three basic colors is black.
Take it easy.
When would you like to meet?
She doesn't like the new job.
I didn't want the neighbors to see me naked.
The operation was successful.
Will Tom still be in the hospital for a long time?
I want you to be with her.
I'll make him pay the money.
You must respect them.
I'm waiting for you in Turin!
You didn't look tired.
I'll pray earnestly.
What will you do if the war begins again?
Tom said he'd do the same.
I'm not going to Australia this year.
The most famous gold shrine is the California Golden Shrine, which began in 1848.
You know why Tom doesn't trust Mary?
Show me your picture.
I get to know new people every day.
I want to go see him.
You cheated Tom.
What are you doing in my room?
We miss it so much.
He answered his parents.
Tom, have you eaten yet?
Who did you give it to?
I held him as a crow.
Nobody's asking you to do this.
I forgot that this is the first April.
Please stop singing this song!
Tom tasted the dog.
I know you're out early.
Tom's been doing this all morning.
I'm aware of the consequences.
To the east and west, the city divides the river.
Why are you coming?
Do you know anyone who speaks French?
That's why it was scary?
Tom invited me to stay overnight.
I don't think Tom's fault.
I'd love you to stay.
I'm impressed by your French.
We both want to do it.
If the ice warms up, it grows.
We could have done that.
The doctor said that's why we need surgery.
I just changed my toothpaste.
Here's something for you.
It's your bedroom.
Tom is realistic.
Who's knocking at my door?
When and where did you meet Tom?
I'm here to let you know.
I feel like an amphibian.
Our team returned home with a triumph.
I went alone.
Tom married an older girl.
I heard him.
Why don't you go to bed?
Did he come to you with a guarantee?
Can you take a picture of us?
I heard you cry.
Show me how to do it!
Everybody shut up.
Let the dust sink.
Why are you so stubborn?
He became a Chinese teacher, but with all these hormones, he became a member of almost every meeting.
I'm glad to inform you that I'm completely cured.
I've written a lot of suggestions to the expert.
I like the watermelon more than the pastel.
I can't make an exception.
He's picturing fast.
I can find them.
I'm here now.
You have the right to a lawyer.
Don't sit too close to the TV.
I'm my head almost every day.
To my surprise, he didn't give up.
Did you steal it?
She must be mad at me.
You don't understand, Tom.
My father likes a fish like me.
Hey, it's me.
Dan showed himself to be a champion of the white race.
I'll try to get them.
I like the color of your shirt.
It's not me, I swear!
I don't think Tom speaks French.
My parents wouldn't understand.
I don't know what to do.
She asked me if she could use the phone.
Tom's better ready than I am.
He's floating like a tortoise.
Tom didn't tell Mary what he needed to buy.
She brought the mallow.
"Tom, turn around." "I'm going!"
I have a big problem.
We're not partners.
We have already faced this problem.
I'm trying to say it in French.
I'm not like everything else.
I managed to get two tickets to the concert.
He likes to boast about his father's successful car business.
She's in the sunscreen.
Come on, Emily, your father's waiting for you.
How many hours can you sit in front of the computer?
Tom can barely walk.
Minus per minus plus.
In the basement.
Please make a donation.
I really need to talk to you.
Tell me something.
I prefer to travel alone.
Ankara is the capital of Turkey.
I went to the barn.
I prefer a simpler approach.
They're cool.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
Jane's kind words hurt us a lot.
I'm trying not to read the news.
What am I supposed to tell him?
You're looking amazing.
I'm grateful for your help.
He couldn't hold a smile.
Wait a minute, did you say "girl" or "pearl"?
I didn't try to kill them.
Education is learning that you didn't even know you didn't.
Tom agreed to help Mary.
You should have thought well before making her pregnant.
Tom says he's not getting married to Mary.
I got two fish.
I think Tom's sick.
Tom's fainted.
I'm not poor.
Professor Hudson is my father’s friend.
Can I come too?
Does Tom make enough money to live in the city?
Question over.
Please turn off the radio.
He said he wasn't sure about his answers.
I heard about Tom and Mary.
Take your jacket if you're warm.
So many of them.
He couldn't follow the principles.
Mary says she's lonely.
You're probably gonna have three hours to go.
That was an easy decision.
Mary said she'd come sooner.
I want to open my own restaurant.
You still buying lottery tickets?
That could be anyone.
One language is never enough.
Mary told me she was a Canadian.
You seem to be suffering.
Tom forgot to tell Mary about the party.
That's what people don't understand.
Tom has a rich imagination.
Finally, she solved the problem.
The main thing is to tell the truth.
I don't want Tom singing at our wedding.
It's all about work.
I had nothing wrong with it.
Tom maintains purity in his room.
These three books belong to Him.
He jumped from one topic to the other.
It's a truce.
Did you tell him I was here?
Tom's coming in.
It's not cold today.
I mistakenly put Tom's shirt on.
It seems that the bank's robbery was planned even before the mill.
So he didn't like it, but he bought it anyway.
Wake up a little.
I want to talk to you about something.
The bank is empty.
Why didn't you show her Tom?
Isn't the weather wonderful?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I was swimming in the river.
Tell them to take off the tube.
Can you tell us what it is?
Say "no" racism.
Tom's a meatball, isn't he?
Don't make me kill you!
What do you like more?
They don't respect him.
No choice.
I want you to be my girlfriend.
Don't hurt us.
You can't answer.
Tom's got a lot of books.
Can you distinguish the alligator from the crocodile?
Wait, is that what?
My grandfather built this house.
Do you want to take advantage of this opportunity?
You can't stay here.
I did it for the first time today.
I came to Australia when I was a child.
You really want me to say 'cause it's you who killed his father?
Your teacher called me.
I'm your father.
Can I do it myself?
All the people were touched by his speech.
Do you know how dangerous this is?
He's running.
He's sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
Can I take a shower in the morning?
Yes, everyone, listen, please.
It's made of wood or metal?
Excuse me!
I think Tom is my friend.
In view of being ignorant and free, the nation is counting on what has never been and will never be.
Tom's barely breathing.
Dogs don't change colors.
Tom poured water out of the bottle before filling it with fresh water.
Dogs are faithful animals.
Tom's house was almost completely destroyed.
You're so stupid.
Tom knows you can't speak French?
Two boats on the lake.
I'm not gonna call you her name.
I knew it was a lie.
It's better to be one than in a bad company.
It's a false data.
There is a difference between them.
I know some of you think Tom's lazy.
You have to tell 'cause he doesn't do that anymore.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he's making a show.
Come closer.
We stopped at Hilton.
That's why it's worth telling Mary the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.
Tom wanted to open the box right away, but I offered to wait for Mary.
She kept complaining that there was no money left.
Don't you think you should call that?
There's something you need to do.
She gave him a present.
Mary's in her room.
Attention!
At the same time, I fell in love with this language.
He's safe, isn't he?
That's what you ordered this pizza?
I need you to help me with that.
Tom's my close friend.
Don't do two things at the same time.
You didn't have to go into the woods alone.
No one sees my tears.
Tom slept again.
She likes you so much.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are multiple.
Tom's never kissed anyone before.
I'll tell them you're in.
I'll listen.
I haven't been home since October.
I'm so happy to meet you.
I didn't forget about the congregation.
They had a wedding last autumn.
He's helping me.
Hands up!
Everybody knows we didn't.
I thought Tom was never in Boston.
She learned to swim when she was five years old.
We complained to the noise manager in the neighborhood.
I'm not gonna let you do this.
I don't think they heard us.
I thought you might need it.
Honesty is one of the righteous.
As soon as you meet him in the new year, you'll have to do it.
There's no book in the library in French.
Any combination of dangerous, especially such.
You could have stayed in Boston.
There's no one there.
Can you write this to the surgeon, please?
We don't think it matters.
No one understands you as much as I do.
Take your age accordingly.
Do you know how to jog?
Did you kill your wife?
We exchanged greetings.
Tom still wants to come.
I thought they wouldn't come.
I don't bear the kind of animal suffering.
I think Tatoeba's braking today.
Sally had her brother clean the toilet.
Mary's apartment is full of mess.
The conference room is now busy.
Potato chips are harmful to your health.
Mine's not as good as yours.
I look forward to Christmas.
I've never seen you so happy.
He made a deep breath.
I think Tom's right.
It's gone.
You see the star?
Ask Tom.
Grab the belt!
That's how you used to say it.
Tom says he's not hungry.
That's always the way it was.
Can't we fire her?
The artificial satellite was taken to orbit.
I'm totally serious.
Are you sure you're sick?
It's too simple.
What happens to our children if a nuclear war begins?
I told them the bank isn't working.
Tom and I soon became friends.
He has a question.
I thought Tom was your best friend.
I'm very sorry about that.
There's nothing to tell me what to do.
Documents on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know that.
Tom didn't tell us how upset he was.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I'm not working today.
That's what you said last time.
I know it's better than anyone.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
I knew it was something like that.
There's nothing to hide from you, is there?
You're lying to me.
Tom was very young.
The account shall be paid to the first number of next month.
My French freak.
We need help.
You're scaring her.
For me, Boston is a cold city, not Chicago.
Tom was a victim of temptation.
I can't talk about colleagues.
Tom lives far away from you?
Why didn't I die?
The fight's over with a dragon.
I didn't take it.
Tom came here yesterday.
I'd like to leave a message.
You chose not that man.
They took a great risk.
We have a white cat.
Maybe you'll never be able to walk again.
He used to be better.
Tom wants to see us.
You weren't home yesterday?
If anyone can do that, then Tom.
The meeting was canceled because of typhoon.
Tom was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2013.
On the way, she was riding with the mules.
Tom speaks French with his grandparents and his parents English.
I don't think Tom's got enough money to buy a ticket.
Tom wasn't easy to find.
They're dancing!
I live with Tom.
This is where I met them.
You're not wasting your time.
Your problem is you don't have enough patience.
Several events marked the appearance of the 20th century.
Stop doing this, Tom.
Tom said he wasn't planning on doing that.
This university was founded by Mr. Smith.
I told him to come to Australia.
I think you could do that.
Tom said that there can be no talking about it.
He's out of bed.
Trains follow schedule.
I paid for Tom.
There are many people who think it's impossible not to be confused in languages.
Why is Tom avoiding me?
The exam will be today?
What motivates you?
I gave Layle my computer.
Swallow your sleeve.
I was hoping you'd come back.
Do you think Tom will agree to meet us?
They say anyone in America can become president, but it's probably not.
Tom never forgot Mary.
The first one on the list is Tom.
What else have you missed?
Mary tried to calm down.
How long is the train coming?
How long is this train coming to Boston?
Didn't you see that?
I need you to call me.
Tom never suspected that Mary and John met each other.
When I get rich, I'll buy a farm.
I burned his liver.
It's the neighboring country.
I called my son.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
Where can I sit?
You can't believe Tom told me!
I'll give you some more time to think.
Make it French, please.
Take the ice cream!
She needs a cab.
The crowd was growing rapidly.
Mary told me she loved me.
That's what Tom told me about what happened.
Bones and rubs.
I'll find her.
Did you think about what I said?
I'm very cold.
We're looking for you!
She loves everyone.
Compare your answers to Tom's.
In Tom's weak heart.
So she'll have to pay for it.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you lend me a carnival knife?
Tom took off his heavy beard.
Did you see my dog?
Don't even try to do this on your own.
Nobody saw you take it.
I'm half Japanese.
Tom says he'll fix it.
You have to come back.
We've already spoken.
I can't believe I finally did it.
Tom didn't know why Mary was sad.
Don't worry!
Why don't you just tell me?
What month is the thirteenth?
I don't know what book to choose.
Tom didn't understand anything at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's wearing a white boy's shirt.
It's a garden.
I'll have to wait.
It was Sunday yesterday, not Saturday.
Is anyone here to meet them?
They're watching you.
How much time do you need?
I think Tom remembered me.
We can do that.
He knows his shortcomings.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary is dressed in black.
We had dinner at the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks for help.
Tom didn't say that, Mary.
It's okay.
There's a lot of opportunities in this town.
What are you wearing?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to get married next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find a hotel.
She's not stronger than me.
You haven't said that yet, have you?
She's got a double arm.
We can't make people do that.
Let me carry it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I can't stand that color.
They sleep together?
We're very grateful for that.
He can't believe he's still not married.
I didn't even know you knew.
I won't let her in.
Our neighbors complained about us.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I never talked to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust that.
She's in a lot of trouble.
I wonder why that's why it's necessary.
That seems suspicious to me.
I'll make it look like you didn't say that.
What are you doing on Friday night?
Tom's not the only one here in Boston.
Will you hold me?
Why don't you like this plan?
I thought you were at work.
That's what you have to decide.
Are you ready to have fun?
Is it you or the enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
Winter's about to end.
The titles and awards don't mean anything to me.
Where did you even find him?
The meeting is delayed.
I'll meet you.
Have you had a good weekend?
Tom's drinking beer.
You don't want to do it, don't do it!
Tom had a good job.
Is that good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need cash.
Bring it to me for a drink.
What do you want to eat at these exits?
Get up!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She smiled at me.
He's afraid we're going to go wrong.
I can't call him home.
You should have apologized to Tom for your rude conduct.
Tom didn't tell me they were married.
The boy ran to his home.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a cab driver when he lived in Boston.
Tom seems to be an optimist.
He's not buying a camera.
I did everything I could to help Tom.
I'll join you with her.
She received the highest scores.
Tom can blow up.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color do you have in your childhood?
I'm out of here in a hurry.
I work for the benefit of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do it.
I was a little scared.
Tom took advantage of the full - time domcrat.
I'd like to come in.
You owe me a note or something.
I want to relax in front of the TV tonight, and I don't want to leave the house.
He'll be here today.
Like death.
Now only half the ninth?
Tom went to the store to buy milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I don't mind if you smoke.
It's safe to swim in this lake.
I cut my finger yesterday.
Tom wanted to have dinner with me today.
Tom doesn't look very good.
She put herself on her hands to warm them up.
Tom said he was glad you came back.
My car's covered in blue shit.
Tom doesn't know about my existence.
Tom found Mary's door open.
Lori's home?
I decided to marry Tom.
I'm not gonna make that mistake anymore.
I don't care whether we stay or not.
I've arranged to marry her.
I've been waiting my whole life for that day.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the exam?
The plane went into a trap.
It wasn't him.
Do you have any friends in Indonesia?
You may need to help her.
Mary lost consciousness.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Will you come with me to the concert?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had the time, I'd be happy to let you know.
I don't know her phone number.
Where are your zoners?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do this for you.
"Hello," said Tom.
Where are you?
I didn't die yesterday.
I'm in pain.
She had no food.
I don't think Tom knows how long.
They're running away.
The road does not match the number of cars passing through it.
You seem to be afraid of my dog.
In the attack!
Look at the price.
You don't have to come to the congregation.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new proposal as a message in a bottle.
You can't find work here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
They loved you all.
We're relatives with him.
I have your granddaughter.
I'm sorry I dumped your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I never worked with her.
She started to grow up in her new office.
Let us take care of this.
I think you're sitting in my place.
I planned to do this yesterday.
It's been a while, isn't it?
My parents don't like my manner of dress.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
That'll be interesting.
I hit him hard and hard.
Because worse?
It's not worth it.
Can I take your hand?
He's green.
Tom heard the noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom wasn't lying all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about cellulite.
The series needs to start watching when all the seasons are off!
Road accidents occur every day.
Where'd you go to jump on the sledgehammer?
You were in the parkmacher?
It's a fascinating prospect.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the scarf.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I haven't slept for two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You should find another way out of this situation.
Disappeared.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's take a picture together.
I failed my exam.
They've already known about it.
You'd better go help her.
The footballer made a huge mistake.
They're coming, too?
She's sleeping like a baby.
Tom forgot to let go of the brakes.
This song reminds me of a girl.
Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
Blow up the whole building.
Tom kissed Mary, and they got dressed.
It's my cat.
Do you already have children?
Tom didn't want to have breakfast.
They like Tom.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
Tom is a hopeful idiot.
It won't let me sleep at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I think you need help.
Don't look at me!
I came to Boston last month.
Let go of the cat.
I know you're all rabbits.
Tom thinks it's a sin to get rid of the products.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place disappears to the right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I don't doubt it.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let's go to church.
Tom's strong whiskey.
Was it hard?
He's responding.
I've never met him before.
How much was he worth?
I need to see you right away.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
The sharks eat fish.
I'm the same as I was before.
Do you know the boy who's crying?
No one knew about it.
It's just amazing.
He said he'd never do that.
The thief will steal the cow.
Tom doesn't swim very well, does he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was just tending to the past.
How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom really doesn't want to go to Boston next week.
Don't let them in.
It's all happening.
What day is it today?
Let's give that another chance.
I just want you to take me as I do.
I'm a regular guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Did Paul kiss Lily in the mouth?
Why don't you go there?
Tom didn't say he'd come with us.
Tom died the day after.
Tom and I should stick together.
I've only heard good about him.
I don't work here anymore.
What do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
You're not going to compare with us.
I saw the car exploded.
The window's here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'll never throw out my Plaston.
I don't want Tom to see me like that.
Stay calm!
What's your favorite TV show?
You want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Comedy Tom's empty.
Oh, my God!
I'm afraid you'll lose.
I like to go to school.
I offered to help.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thank your son for me.
Looks like her father's a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
Your dog.
What do you mean?
You can't do anything about it.
Tell him I'm going to go home today.
They need you.
It's orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Don't you see what happened?
I didn't want to bother him.
The officer took courage from his men.
Tom will never find her.
In any case, I'm thinking about trying things like that.
I don't understand much about hunting.
For the first time, I'm going to make a home of meat on a grill.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do that?
Tom would have apologized to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many zonts do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
It was already known.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You don't have to lie.
I know Tom's gonna pay for it.
Mom, look what I found.
It's interesting what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I never met Tom.
Maybe she said that.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw him look at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom must be home.
She was the one I was thinking about.
Tom showed the police his driving rights.
I snuck up every month.
I told you I don't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
It's an acid apple.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new directory.
That must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go too.
You're taking the job home?
According to mythology, Prometheus has taken the sacred fire from the gods.
Welcome to the world of physics.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All the passengers were able to get off the bus before it was burned.
I want to help you understand that.
You speak French better than me.
There are many talented people in our town, but Tom doesn't belong to them.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We're taking checks.
My bike's gone.

We don't know what Tom and Mary know.
I want to be happy.
You're going to lose.
We've seen it before.
How many legs did you buy?
We never leave hope.
What happened to the book I put here yesterday?
Don't even talk about the price. I'm not going to pay for it.
I want to know who started it.
I didn't think they'd punish me.
Write it as a quarantine.
We didn't build it.
You'd better go help him.
Is that okay?
Tomorrow morning they're selling tickets to Shakira's concert.
It was better today.
I know Tom's a brave man.
I got married early.
It's not a rat.
I don't want to scare you.
Tom told me Mary wouldn't want to go.
Have you spoken to doctors yet?
No one's seen it.
Mary is an outstanding artist.
I think he's right.
Everybody likes money.
They went astray in the woods.
When's the last time you ate?
My heart hurts.
My father won't let me go to a movie.
I saw a ton boat.
Instead of going to work, I spent the whole day at home.
I'll back you up.
I didn't talk to Tom.
They decided to work harder.
It's not sold.
Who's your neighbor?
My father usually watches the TV after dinner.
He's drinking wine.
Please cut yourself a apple pie, I've prepared it for you.
I don't think Tom understood the question.
You have to stop her.
You'll make it if you leave now.
There was no special problem with Tom.
The darkness didn't hide it.
I invited him to dinner.
I'm sure it'll be easy to find a place.
I took two aspirin tablets from the main pain.
You're in my heart.
He took me to the last dig.
Don't laugh!
Love doesn't obey anyone.
If you come to Tom right now, you'll probably stay on his television.
I saw you in the park with Tom.
I didn't mean to offend them.
I'd better go find them.
My motorcycle broke down on the road.
Tom made himself without a shirt.
In what kingdom was this church built?
Soon we'll be able to put you in jail.
I'm starting to think you're serious.
I'm not coming back anymore.
I'm sure Tom would like to help.
It's Joanna.
I made so many mistakes.
How can people do such things?
That's why I'm really sorry.
I like your eyes.
The rainwater runs through this tube.
I always thought Tom was a close friend.
I'm one of those girls who're more friends with guys.
Don't worry, I have insurance.
Tom will be here with me.
My dad's having a hard time letting go of it.
Nobody's suggesting you do this.
He works in this company from Monday to Sunday.
Mary forgot to shut down the car.
I'm old.
Tom left Mary.
Tom started laughing.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Tom has telepathic skills.
Who is he by nationality?
Tom was sitting in one of the cameras with John.
I didn't want to swim.
He drank beer.
In our time, it's harder for a man to be... alone.
I'll never talk to him again.
Sh-sh, Tom, wake up!
I'm wearing my toes.
I did what I promised to do for them.
I'm a new teacher.
They're all children.
She went out and yelled at me.
Have you taken your medicine?
The rabbits are very nice.
She doesn't trust him.
Time on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
You like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
Did you want to tell me something?
I doubt Tom's still angry.
You'll be better in the morning.
What do you want to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you feel the smell of burnt resin?
It didn't happen here.
When will your father come home?
I understand.
Tom screened Mary's book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of my mind.
Tom patient.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary are not married.
Tom's trying to escape.
You're obviously tired.
We're champions.
Tom is deaf.
Tom said it wasn't enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring the salad to the party.
Her hair is wet from the floor.
I only buy a soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom sat in the middle between the door and Mary.
How do you know how much it's worth?
The pilot is a master of compliments.
Tom's married to Mary, isn't he?
All the rocks in the park were busy.
Someone needs to tell her that.
I've got it all done.
Vermont is on the border with Canada.
He had to live in one room with his brother.
I'm not an imbecile.
You're gonna do it, aren't you?
I don't know how to hunt.
He has a brother in Tokyo.
Dynamite invented Alfred Nobel in 1857.
We need to get involved.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
You can come up if you want.
I know you don't have to do this.
I suggest you let them go.
Take my eyes.
I've already spoken to this student.
What is the chemical sign of bromoic acid?
We have a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in the haystack.
I asked Tom.
That's why we need to talk to a lawyer.
I think you should do this.
The key!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed as a court man.
I respect his views, although he disagrees with many of them.
Neboskrben is in the center of the city.
Who sent you?
She tied him up with a sweater.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to go to Boston with you.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
After nine calls cheap?
You don't have to go.
Put it in half.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her not.
He didn't say anything.
You don't use them, do you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We didn't have a chance to win.
Are you planning on staying long?
We had an emergency, and then we left.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You're straight.
Careful, don't push yourself into the leg.
Start each meal with soup.
I'm afraid to be alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you call him at all?
He didn't stop the car.
He was sitting right across from me.
The ring was open.
It's my fault.
I'm unpopular.
It's his first day at school.
I want to meet you before I die.
She's beautiful, too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I suggest another strategy?
They're dead.
Big apples.
You didn't know Tom was living in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about it.
She's driving?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.
Tom listened with interest.
I think they're happy.
You understand, Tom?
Let's go to the car.
You're messing with me.
She wondered how his lips would taste.
A good coach is training this team.
The tree's sick.
The train was stopped because of heavy snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
Why did you take that I didn't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him he was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It must have been you.
Mary left me in the locker room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
You live there?
What would you have eaten?
You don't know her?
I didn't ask if Tom was planning to do it or not.
I'm falling.
I wasn't able to come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom's wearing a new shoe.
Last year she learned to ride a bicycle.
Help us.
I don't have to thank you.
Since it was winter, he didn't go out on the street.
I'm going down the street. I saw my friend.
How many houses on your street?
The elephants are made of ivory.
I'm not a kid anymore.
"What's your life, Mike?" "My name's Tom."
Her native language is French.
It's a pretty weird coat.
She stopped smoking.
Tom was married then.
I bought this book.
Naïveness is its only positive quality.
My hobby is collecting insects.
Tom lived in Boston as a child.
I haven't eaten for six days.
Can I tell them about this?
She's been quiet all day.
It doesn't matter what he can say, don't believe him.
I'm on my way.
Tom and Mary hope their next child will be a boy.
Mary is always very welcoming, and she has a nice smile.
I won't let her die.
In all cultures, babies fall asleep under their knees.
It's the best restaurant I know.
You could know a lot of them if you just listened.
What was I supposed to do in that situation?
I'm sorry I upset you.
A person who has never left his country is a prejudice.
It's amazing how quiet it gets when the snow falls.
Tom's helping a woman.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd come back.
For many people in India, cows are sacred animals.
I've got an idea.
I thought we could do that.
My mom was against me driving alone.
I'm sorry, I didn't get it.
You know what you're doing, right?
You can't trust a car transfer.
She hit me, not him.
You won't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
The river is full of fish.
His success was nothing but a miracle.
We're partners with her.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms?
Locked free.
What, they said, did it happen?
Couldn't you leave the door open?
It's gonna have to wait.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's twice my height.
Tom knows they made a mistake.
In Japan, it's a soft climate.
Check again.
Don't condemn Tom.
My mom finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let him do what he wanted.
He replaced the traumatized game.
Tom said he doesn't believe in it.
Our trip was very smooth.
It's inevitable that one day I'm going to France, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
Tom's only getting sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
Tom's watching.
The rain stopped, the window could be opened again.
It's never been like this with me before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was going to leave when I called.
I don't have to endure this.
Always get in the way of the right-hand man.
We're asked to be presented in turn.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
Maybe she's nice, but I don't like her.
I can let you go if you want.
Tom told Mary she was wasting her time.
You still have a problem with that?
I never asked her.
Nothing relaxes like a hot tub.
I really don't have that much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's an open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I totally forgot about that.
You have nothing to regret.
She's my lover!
The sound of your voice like a melodic song is for me.
How can we be married?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why Mary didn't like it.
My fingers left on a glass of prints.
The chemical is a remarkable science.
I feel like my French isn't getting much better.
How can I best get a passport?
Maybe you're in a position to help Tom.
Tom is the best drummer I know.
I didn't know Tom was your boss.
He needs you.
They're ready.
Tom didn't pay attention to Mary all day.
Tom's got fat hair.
Tom doesn't want to sell a house, but he doesn't have a choice.
There's more light outside.
I gave my sister a speech.
It's my father's car, but she'll be mine soon.
Did you forget his name?
If I had time to do this, I would.
Do you see Tom's boat?
What's the big fam?
This medicine will help you.
Stop the noise.
I'm in pain.
Do you know how busy I was?
Tom's busy.
I can trust someone.
She's a "Sex in the Big City" fan.
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Talk to him well.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do that?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
Christ works, stop it!
Nothing compares to a glass of beer after a long working day.
What happened?
Tom left his bag.
Here are some interesting facts.
How much time do you need?
Let's move over here.
You're in new shoes?
You can leave if you want.
Did you find the book you were looking for?
That's what my mom said.
She cut the makeup when she saw the dog.
He's not above me at all.
Smoking is strictly forbidden.
That Persian is beautiful.
You see?
Tom's not in the mood for that.
You didn't have to go to such a dangerous place.
Good job!
You used to say that yourself.
Here's a few letters for you.
It is virtually unthinkable that a scientist would make such a fundamental mistake.
He has no evidence.
You look bad.
He was very good at swimming when he was young.
I'm writing to my friend.
He's very good at playing tennis.
She led the students into error.
She said she was a Canadian.
Don't talk to anyone.
And when were you going to tell me?
I didn't want to tell you that.
I filled the bucket up.
Go straight.
I'm too tired to think about it right now.
Where do you live?
I told them it wasn't nice.
What do we live for?
Will it rain today?
We know about her.
You could have helped us.
I often drive a car.
That's why I don't like the movie ending.
Just get in there.
Just ask him to forgive me.
I'm trying to protect them.
Tom did a great job.
I'm two of you.
I didn't know it was legal.
I love adventures.
Tom's in the library.
Did you go to school then?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who it was.
Why didn't you wait for us?
I didn't know.
Why didn't you dance with us?
Are you enough?
I've decided to forgive Tom.
I'm starting to enjoy myself.
Tomorrow's gonna be a big snowfall.
We decided to postpone the meeting on the next Sunday.
She thinks she can prove it.
When was the last time you played golf?
Are we poor?
I don't know the name Tom.
We have the same dentist.
Not all Brazilians like carnival.
I don't think Tom knows what's going on.
To whom did Tom sell his car?
Tom's moaning.
I have to make money to buy a computer.
Don't laugh at strangers.
I don't know them.
If you could choose genes for your children, would they?
So Mary and I have to rest.
It was easy to sleep.
It could've been worse.
Tom did his part.
Tom doesn't know where Mary's keys are.
What book are you looking for?
I'm sleeping a little.
You'll get there sometime.
Tom's fine with Mary.
"You have to pay me." "No, you don't."
He went up and stood on his knees.
You don't have to go there if you don't want to.
This song always reminds me of my childhood.
Tom did this for you?
I don't think Tom knows I love Mary.
He says he's rich.
Tom works three times more than Mary.
I drank milk.
It'll be snow tomorrow.
Is Life Not Wonderful?
When it comes to getting ready, no one compares with Mary.
You haven't been yourself lately.
Tom lost his leg when he attacked the shark.
I burned it for you.
We'll do it as soon as we can.
Next year, I'll be your senior three times.
Can you tell me what happened?
Show me your stamp collection.
It'll take forever.
Tom's a little bit more famous than Mary.
He looks like no one knows.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
How did you know who to give it to?
This tissue fits your skin.
I fell in love with you.
It's almost winter.
I think Tom lied to me.
We're all very proud of her.
Tom's parents told him not to.
Tom and I were surprised.
It's okay with me.
Tom decided to give up his professional guitar game.
I'm married now.
It was just a couple of times.
This time you've gone too far.
It's working.
Are you going to see Tom before you leave?
No wonder, Tom answered.
We want to take the apartment out of town.
They spoke more French.
It's extremely expensive.
He's no longer a poet.
I didn't know what else to do.
They haven't woken up yet.
Tom's a couple of inches above Mary's.
I'm glad you suggested that.
It's hard to answer your question.
You don't believe her?
English is a world language.
Sounds simple.
Can I get a copy of these?
I just told him to leave Mary alone.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston when he was a kid?
Tell them what I told you.
Tom's looking for a job.
Why do you need milk?
Stay with me, Dad, I'm afraid of the dark.
The situation is getting worse.
I choose where to bite.
Tom decided to buy a supported car instead of a new one.
I just wanted to wish you good luck.
She's breaking up.
I'm not gonna let you take my kids.
Don't give it to him.
Run away, and that'll arrest you.
Mary said she was very tired.
Tom made the rule to meditate every morning.
Have you checked your bills?
He tried to make a short story.
A bookless room like a body without a soul.
Why did God hurt us so much?
What's your brother doing?
We need a volunteer.
Why is Tom so sure it won't happen again?
I haven't seen you in a hundred years.
I called Tony yesterday.
It's easy to make an impression on her.
You're old enough to do this on your own.
The Archduke believed that the Earth was the center of the universe.
It's interesting that Tom actually meant it.
No one understands me.
There's so many stars in the sky, I can't read them.
They all came back and looked at us.
Let me see.
White bears live in the Arctic.
I told you I was the best of all.
I told you Tom wanted to go to Boston.
Tom doesn't have to ask me to do something a couple of times.
Let the dish be washed today by the one who loses the paper stone!
What a failure!
I would never do that.
You ever been to Boston?
He said Russian — at least, he told me.
Tom's a third grader.
Will you stay long?
I'm not a woman.
She's got a tall father.
The train was overloaded.
The house is red.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
You don't know Boston, do you?
The orchestra started playing.
Mary was in a pirate's suit.
It's not my wife.
Why didn't you mention it before?
Tom didn't want to be a knocker.
He was born at seven a.m. on 5 June 1970.
I'm afraid your plan won't work.
Jane and Kate are twins.
Tom's just white meat.
Thank you for helping.
We only have three rules.
She bought one of herself.
Security didn't see Tom.
In recent years, Tom has made a remarkable observation.
I helped carry those bags.
They have plenty of time.
Fifteen per five is equal to seventy-five.
I live in this hotel.
I don't want to know anything anymore.
You still don't know what he's gonna say.
My hands are up.
I've been stealing women all the time.
Finally, she did it.
It's disgusting nonsense that they weren't insured from the fire.
We've got a lot of money.
The examination was broken down into two parts.
When are you gonna tell them?
Tom didn't want to talk about his illness.
Hey, you're so bored here!
Let's compare the book reading with the journey.
Tom saw Mary come into the store.
Why aren't you there?
Tom said Mary would probably win.
The Japanese would never do that.
I don't care so much about Boston.
She keeps writing letters.
I don't know who to consult.
Turn left at the corner.
Tom taught me to do it.
We can do a lot more.
Give me one, please.
I'm not bringing in disobedient children.
That's what Tom bought me.
What you said, everybody was upset.
You're too small for that.
My parents have been married for thirty years.
She showed her talents.
I wish it were possible.
I guess you can't do that.
I'm lucky I'm alive.
For the first time at Bob's next school festival.
You must stay in shape.
I've been sucking seeds all day.
The accent is that I realized he's an American.
Maybe it's a problem.
Was that a joke?
Forgive me!
Tom has submitted.
All the people of my generation think about it the same way.
I live for it.
Do you know how to jump on the sledgehammer?
Duke reigns in many lands.
Well, they're having fun.
He told me he was very happy.
My dad's getting better.
You'll feel at home.
It's not gonna end well!
He looked like he didn't eat for a few days.
I didn't ask you to go there.
"Who is Norman Finkelstein?" "American politician."
Get out of here!
If it's not selling goods at home, then maybe it's a new way to get to know girls?
Tom improved the coin.
Why didn't you get out of your room?
If there is no God, it's all allowed.
Both of us are Mary.
I knew I had to marry him.
Are you still at work?
New?
Don't take anything for granted.
You're in time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please follow the belts during take-off and landing.
That was why and Mary.
We both love seafood.
I've waited a long time.
I rejected the proposal.
You want to come with us?
Tom, not El.
I'm going to have too much time to explain why it doesn't work.
Nothing has changed.
Did you build all of this yourself?
I look forward to the summer vacation.
Can we make this a different one?
That's where he looks.
Dried homes are easily lit.
So let's have a party.
The dog's still alive.
I'm going to college.
I know you lied.
It's very convenient.
I'll report this tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's undercover.
I want to hear your side.
I'll wait here for him to come.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know the size of Mary's shoe.
I need to think about it.
The meeting was scheduled on Tuesday.
My name is Jose, we're friends.
You forgot to mention it.
We don't need that anymore.
Can I have something to eat?
Tom can do this without our help.
Everybody's ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who arranged the meeting?
I'm such a bad guy.
Tom wants to fix it.
I'm not going to have fun tonight.
Mary was the only girl in the jube.
What bird can't fly?
That's what we need to put an end to.
Tom didn't respond right away.
Tom died at the age of seventy.
Life is a gift.
Tom also speaks more French.
The invention of the transistor marked a new era.
I'm not in love with Mary.
Did you hear what she said about Alexie?
You look like a girl.
Here's a few photos.
What's going on on the tenth channel?
I hate spinach.
Mother's getting ready for lunch.
Tom's a fireman.
What can I do?
Her son is a genius.
I know you've seen terrible things.
I know a few Canadians.
He's willing to give the emotions.
We were shocked by the news of his death.
Why didn't they go?
I didn't see you.
You're just noticing obvious.
He had cancer.
You're the one responsible for what happened.
It's like hours.
I know where you're going.
You're taking it all for a flight.
Let's get him out of here.
Let's leave it till tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he tells us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do that.
I don't like doing that.
The janitor stopped the conversation.
On the writing table, the cat.
I don't want to be late for work.
You don't get sick anymore.
Tom was a busy chicken.
Tom gave me a ring.
It's hard to talk to Tom.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he was worried.
Tom's not used to the weather.
I wonder who's gonna help him decorate the snow?
I still don't know why Tom did it.
Do you believe in family souls?
What's that noise?
My son has inherited a disease.
That's disgusting.
Is it snow?
I'll call you back.
He dropped the glass.
I don't know if there's a country where you can marry your dog.
Better protection is an attack.
She's getting married this autumn.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it'd be easy.
Can we help you?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
When are you ready to go?
The investigations began last year with the confiscation of human computer archives from the German city of Magdeburg.
How's life?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
What did you decide you couldn't do?
We went back through Boston.
Who will believe that?
Thank you for the correction.
She's got it with her mind?
The stars appear at night.
Where did Tom take this scarf?
They wanted proof.
Tom's on his plate.
Tom can't ride a bike.
I'm not talking at all.
Why did Tom leave?
Why would you want to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild beasts.
How much more money do you need?
Mary laughed at the tears.
I spent $500 a day.
Tell them to go home.
That's where it's good to be.
They didn't make it in time.
Now seven thirty.
I see you're awake.
I want to know who said that to me.
Tom got up early to see the light.
The dinosaurs died a long time ago.
I usually get up one by one.
Tom's got another year.
I'm around the station.
Tom's a very good boy.
Are you drinking?
Are you from Boston?
Put it on my desk.
Tom, get out of the water.
I was so proud of it.
You were ready.
Do you know Brother Tom?
All oats can lay eggs.
You'll pay for what you did.
I'm out of my hands today.
I asked them to stay away from this.
Tom only learned to drive in thirty.
I'm glad he didn't get hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed in so long.
The kitchen knife was not strong enough to cut meat, so I took advantage of my wig knife.
Honey, I can explain everything.
You'll soon be able to adapt to village life.
Keep the air in the water.
You're not a child anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We're all right.
The river is deep.
Thank you very much.
I told you that a hundred times.
I'm very cold.
I guess you should tell him.
They're dead.
Tom and Mary kissed.
Writing words separately in cases where they are to be written in the same way is a major problem in Norwegian.
What are you doing with the leftovers of the prepared rice?
It's been ten years since her death.
Tom met Mary a year ago.
Do you need anything else?
We left soon after that.
This book must be read.
Tom and Mary did lessons for dinner.
I don't want to drink your tea.
You're always so romantic.
A woman is not a frog — you can't get off her feet.
I'll come see you at 6:00.
So I teach French.
I love learning other languages.
Mary's having a look.
I'd like to know how long Tom is planning to be in Australia.
You didn't know I couldn't do that, did you?
How did you feel?
Let's give that a chance.
I like fruit.
Tom broke up.
He's trafficking cars.
You're still in touch with her?
"Do you think he'll come?" "I hope he won't."
Tom didn't expect Mary to win.
I hate hospital food.
I ate a tortoise.
They shot me.
She knows her husband's psychology.
We have to check.

He couldn't believe his eyes.
They first got on the bus.
Let's wait till Monday.
Does anyone know them here?
There must be a mistake.
He can't afford to take a vacation.
I'm used to smell.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How was the day?
It's your fault.
I told you when to come.
Of course, I kept my promise.
Our friendship remained strong.
Have you ever talked to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get closer to the case.
Tom was sitting on the stairs.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes a mole beats twice in one place.
I don't brag.
Leave it behind.

Tell me frankly.
I'll come in whatever it is.
You don't mind making another cup of coffee when you want it?
I'd like to go back to Tokyo through Honolulu.
You're not telling me anything I don't know.
I couldn't help them.
Tom left last time.
Tom signed the petition.
Did you try to talk to Tom about this?
You scared them.
She insisted on her innocence.
We don't know that much about Tom.
How was the day?
Don't worry about my dog.
Now I understand.
Give me time.
You want them to help?
Tom's nowhere to see.
That's why I told you to come here.
Find out what they said.
Apples are the best fruit.
Couldn't you close the window?
Tom didn't have a ticket.
We can meet again in the near future.
The trees calmed me down.
He's a boob.
I've been sleeping for a while.
Hold on to me.
You have the right to your opinion.
Mary told me she was buying it.
I made breakfast.
I'd like to buy two marks for forty-five cents, please.
I'll give you a bike on your birthday.
Tom began to suspect that something was wrong.
There's beer.
I don't think that's why it's gonna like it.
I thought he was innocent.
I'll wait for you here.
I'd like you to talk to him.
You said she was yours.
Tom's been doing his research.
Look at that cat.
I'm divorced.
That's very interesting.
Don't be late.
That's what we're working on.
Everybody's having fun?
Tom's watching a digital TV show.
We're gonna have to sleep on the street tonight.
That's what Tom showed Mary, how's it going?
Amazing, isn't it?
I cut the rose.
The school's only five minutes from walking out of here.
Tom put a bed in a carnival.
It's the only thing you care about?
Do you see the rose?

People often complain about the weather.
I just need you to sign it.
I felt like something was wrong.
Tom swallowed a beer.
I'll tell you what to do.
The man who was born in France is French.
I'm not used to it.
It's a gift from her.
Do you have a house?
Don't feed the wolf.
Hey, it's me.
Now tell me something about you.
Tom was the only one in the pool.
I'm studying French on my own.
Tom couldn't answer all Mary's questions.
Tom is teaching my children French.
Tom says he didn't eat for three days.
It doesn't look like Tom's having fun.
There are some non-sticks here.
I had to tell him to get up there.
We're gonna finish it.
I know you're in love with Tom.
Dick handed me a photograph.
You said you'd help her.
Did you really expect Tom to tell you the truth?
I couldn't look her in the face.
This could happen.
Someone sent us a gift.
Tom and I have been married for three years.
It's hard to live with Tom, right?
Have you ever seen Tom dance?
Tom asked for my advice.
Tom started crying.
She's wearing an ashtray.
He never would've lied to me.
She wasn't sick.
I tried to be nice.
He deliberately slipped away so that he wouldn't kill me.
You think I'd change my mind?
Tom is an Australian citizen.
Did you buy them?
Tom just looked at Mary and laughed.
I gave them my old coat.
Tom called for Mary's help.
Are you a liberator or a conservator?
We don't know exactly why this is happening.
The presence is mandatory.
I took Leila's photo from my computer.
There was rain in Boston on Monday.

How many do you want?
They say Venice is a beautiful city.
You should talk to Tom.

At first, I didn't like him, but now he does.
I forgot the money.
I'm on a eleven-hour train.
I can't dedicate you to my plans.
I broke it.
Is that why you said that?
Tom and Mary know each other very well.
You bought a precious coat.
Scientists explain that differently.
What are you doing here?
Do Germans have any other concerns in their lives than consumption?
Does she have a brother or a sister?
Hey, what are you doing?
They sell shoes.
The card's very cheap.
Why?
It's my favorite project.
We don't have any water.
Don't you want to introduce yourself?
Don't worry, even if I drink, it doesn't affect how I drive.
Tom told me he'd stay home.
I lived in a three-bedroom apartment in Boston.
Don't look at it.
On the contrary, our school is a bus stop.
That's exactly why more than thirty.
Tom's wearing an umbrella.
"Oh, I'm dying," said Pierreette, kneeling down. "Who's gonna save me?"
After I sat on the train, I noticed that I forgot the paper at home.
How long after Tom died?
Are you playing guitar?
We hope we don't have to do this.
We have a situation under control.
Who's there?
Today's payday?
That's obviously inevitable.
It's your fault, not me.
I wanted everything.
We'll do it tomorrow.
Shut up, you're talking too much.
Don't trust him.
What search system are you using?

Tom told me he didn't want to move to Australia.
Tom promised he wouldn't cry.
So I told you all about what we did yesterday.
I'm so glad.
I need to feed my baby's chest.
Drinking is a food that is suitable for modern living.
Do you know where the dog is?
Tom said he wasn't mad at Mary.

Tom would never do what you accused him of.
Tom's not the only one late.
