Barack Obama gets as fourth American President Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will fly to Norway's Oslo for 26 hours to take over the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth American president in history.
Diploma, medals and cheques for $1.4 million, among other things, will receive exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House will fly to the Norwegian metropolis in the morning with Michelle's wife and will have plenty.
First, he joins the Nobel Institute, where he first meets with five members of the committee, who elected him from 172 people and 33 organisations in October.
The president's couple then have a planned meeting with Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonjo.
In the afternoon, the visit will be followed by a celebration ceremony to which Obama will take the prestigious award.
He gets it as the fourth U.S. president, but only the third one who gets the price right in the office.
The White House has already warned that Obama will speak of the Afghan War when receiving appreciation.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he realizes that the price is being taken over as the president who is currently fighting in two countries.
A few days ago, war effort was even increased by sending another unit to Afghanistan, which will not forget to highlight any of its criticisms.
Obama also receives gold medals, diplomas and cheques on ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
You're going to give for charity, but he hasn't decided on a specific charter yet.
The President-in-Office's programme will then set up a banquet where, apart from the king of Norway and the queen, the Prime Minister and other 250 guests will also be invited.
Obama's been building himself more persistently from the beginning to the price.
For example, he said he felt he didn't deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it is not just the price for him, but for all those who strive for the same values as him.
Shortly after the announcement, he said it was "a call for action".
Protection of the nature of the accused of extermination
The Lithuanian police accused the President of the Civil Society of the Lithuanian Nature Protection Society of the extermination.
In a number of cases in the past year, he appealed to some construction management, demanded that the investors be withdrawn for their benefit, said Lithuanian police spokesman Alena Romová.
The President of the Lithuanian Nature Protection Society is Lubomir Studnička.
He's now in custody and he's been threatened for up to three years.
Brno's class containers don't hurt too much
In Prague, ordinary people can class their drinks packages, and in the South Moravian villages, you will meet each step of the class containers.
And in Brno?
There to win a few minutes before you can find the right buttocks.
I don't want to say that the waste in Brno wouldn't be handled at all.
But it turns out that we're the second largest city in the Republic, the council is not interested in this problem.
Brno is not only in the waste classification washhouse, but as citizens here we can still throw paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers, but above all the number of garbage on such waste.
Have you ever tried in the center, for example, to throw PET sheets into the collecting basket?
It's a good piece of cake, especially it wants time and nerves.
The only place I've ever met is in Moravian Square across the Potrefene House.
Don't let Mr. Onderk and his colleagues get mad at me, but I don't get to hell.
Do not mention that there is no honey in other parts of the waste classification.
A number of my friends don't handle waste like that.
It's slow.
They've got it far to the ashtray.
I don't admire them.
I offered myself after the celebration to throw out some glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colored ashtrays on Kounico Street.
Luckily, I ran into the right place on my way to the border.
However, the waste ran out of it.
It's still the center of Brno, which probably represents the city most, right?!
But ecology and some aesthetics probably don't care much.
These cities would rather buy a hockey extralige that would make us ashamed of the whole Republic than buy a few containers and offer to classify other raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I could have confirmed official statistics after a moment of browsing the Internet.
According to ECO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole of South Moravia.
"Paroubkov" budget took money on pensions and sick
After the left added, despite the opinion of the government to farmers or officials, it must not be in the budget of money on income, hospital or construction costs.
But also for government debt interest or international court disputes.
It will create problems for those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the social Democrats and the Communists promoted a rise in some groups, they assumed that the government would lend more to sensitive spending, income or illness. "It's just putting the problems into the future, putting the mines away," Janota says.
The amount of money borrowed is as high as possible and sometimes has to be returned.
There's no way to choose where to take it.
If it does not reduce social benefits or costs at the expense of the state, it must raise the tax.
To all that now the left hand gave he to the firemen, and to the teachers, and to the tillers.
And later on, their kids.
About the pension or the sick, whose account has gone missing 1.8 billion, people don't have to worry, they'll get it.
However, at the price of the state's more debt – next year it will not be less than 163 billion, but more.
In spite of this, I am trying to make Minister Janota grow as much as possible, along with him and the interest costs.
The State will need money on its payroll and will no longer be sufficient to increase VAT or reduce the maternal rate, as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
Because of the money transfers in favour of several groups of volunteers, five billion will also be missing next year to supply roads and railways.
It is mainly about the already depleted and arranged sections that are not redesigned and, where appropriate, decommissioned.
At the most, it's not free, either.
This means delaying or suspending the thirty major buildings, which are also threatened with the use of European money, warns the spokespersons of Karel Hanzelk's transport ministry.
ČSSD has proposed that the balance of the money will resolve the shaamounsky – it will fall to the dividend of ČEZ, which is mainly owned by the majority, and from which the transport fund will fall.
The problem is that the amount of dividends is never certain, and it's no longer a pointless source.
Last year, from the Czech Republic to the 18 billion budget.
Each year, the dividend is paid for the disposal of environmental damage, the pension account is supplemented or served as a reserve for a future pension reform.
In addition, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the actual budget deficit by 5.7% of GDP.
But that's not the end of the movement.
Nearly three billion were spent in the budget for various damages to the victims of communism and criminal acts or for the costs of judicial disputes, even for construction disputes.
If you don't have the money, it's not sure.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we'll have to pay it anyway, says Janota.
The Minister will then have to save money inside the resort or, in the worst case, reach the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing from the two billion-dollar state treasure project already under way, which is intended to allow online monitoring of what individual agencies are losing.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister didn't find money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, the sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will manage two operating systems
The Americans to the future are counting with the mobile phone on which the user will press the single button to switch between different operating systems.
Revealed plans sound like a promise.
Just press one key and from Windows Mobile you will be transferred to Android in a few seconds.
This is precisely what the American company VMware aims at, focusing mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to run two user profiles at once.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into household and work.
Both will work in one and at the same time, Srinavas Krishnamurti from VMware in the computer world magazine interview.
He was presented in November last year and was first presented a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully submitted a smartphone test sample to journalists with two operating systems.
It was nokia N800 with RAM memory of 128 MB size, on which the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems were running at the same time.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full stream.
VMware now cooperates with European and American operators to test the virtualisation of smartphones and the devices should be delivered to customers during 2012.
Lack of snow on the mountains afflicts hotelers
The high-ends don't just worry about the crocodiles.
Lack of snow also reflects people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, free rooms are still available in Krkonosha for all winter periods, including Christmas and Silvestra.
We've got a lot of visitors on our pages.
People go through offers, find prices, but so far they're afraid to order.
And if they call us, they'll be wondering if we think this year's Christmas will be on the snow or on the mud," said the information portal operator Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Whoever wants a silvestrovski stay in Špindler's Mlýn according to his ideas should no longer weigh orders.
Whoever gives priority to money savings and the quality of the accommodation is with him to the second place, he can still try to wait a few days.
Špindlerovš hotels are currently offered on Silvestra mainly only weekly stays.
I think they'll try to marry them for a while, but then they'll let and go for a little while.
And then the free rooms will die quickly," Jandura estimated.
The free bed in all winter terms is still offered by the Ingtours travel office.
Now we're most interested in the Christmas week that hasn't been sold yet.
That's how half of the place in our offer remains free.
That's why we've already found some cheaper holiday stays at the last minute," Ingtours Director Petr Schiefert said.
Silvestra in Krkonosha can also offer the top travel office, but there are fewer free places.
Good for the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter terms are sold on average.
This year’s interest in winter stays has a negative impact on the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for him to attack.
No one wants to spend the rest of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the snacks are snowed during the week, Christmas is also sold," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, something better than February can be contained in the rooms of the Hotel Horizont in Peci under Snow.
We're about five percent better.
We've got the last few places on Sylvestra and Christmas.
It is of great interest to Polish holidays in January and is well sold in February," said the director of the best hotel Karel Council.
Of the 80 percent have silvestrovic stays and the hotel Omnia at the central parking lot in Janský Lázni.
On the contrary, at Christmas, there are still half of the beds available in the most recent Janskolasen hotel.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by the ice, which is now about 60 percent.
It's a little weaker until February, but as soon as the snow hits, the interest in staying in Krkonosh will certainly rise, the hotel manager of the Omnia Erik Sporysch.
However, for the greater variety of snow, the crocodile hotel has to let go of taste.
It's supposed to cool off on Thursday if there's any hits, so there should be snow on the mountains.
But then he was to come warm again, he informed Jiří Jakubský from the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute's headquarters.
USA: Repeating is a mother of wisdom
He is rather comical, with what school effort Barack Obama, president of the most intelligent, repeats in the Afghan question of his predecessor's strategy, which he himself considered to be the dumbest.
When he finally drowned his eagerly anticipated Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had taken it over a copy of Bush's Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only in the text itself, he repeatedly uses the verb "as in Iraq", but he does not even dare to use the name Bush's January 2007 declaration as the name of his own declaration: "New road forward".
But three years ago he himself criticised Bush's idea of sending fresh military forces to Iraq with civil war as "unsponsible and in its consequences of disastrous decisions".
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy based on the recommendations of the full commanders was the only possible and most successful one that is not currently being discussed in the report reports on Iraq.
Bush did not improve his reputation, but he objectively left his successor a much more grateful background than was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
He was again asked to increase the military contingent by full commanders, in particular the Chief Chief of the Afghan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticised the heavy shooter in the White House despite his subordinary habit.
He asked for 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president weighed three months, but he didn't get any better, and at least he slammed the generals with 10,000 soldiers.
He has been able to demand the commitment of the next 5,000, even though he had originally counted at least 10.
The most problematic on the whole Obama strategy seems to be his intention to start downloading troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and end this process in three years. The entire Obama doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that half an increase gives the same fruit as the one in Iraq.
Even in recent years, the Iraqi society has been relatively well organized, its leaders honor the agreement.
The Afghan situation is marked by a different sign - nobody can be relied on and no agreements are complied with.
Under these conditions, Afghan security forces are being prepared to change the gentleman every day according to how they fit.
The political institutions, although formally founded, will remain only a dark village, followed by patriarchal tribal relations.
The exportation of interests of different ethnic groups is unusually difficult due to the lack of transparency of the circumstances that further complicate the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even building "a state of action", which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation, does not seem to be too real.
Obama's strategy's time horizon is invading its volunteerism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the verge of an explosion.
To believe that soldiers sending to a war cry for the purpose of "fast return home" causes a miracle done here, can only the soul truly romantic, reality unattainable.
From a political point of view, the date of the deployment of the army is completely irresponsible, as the Taliban will consider it an indirect recognition of the US defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that the Europeans' willingness to participate in war operations in Afghanistan is headed for a decline.
European politicians do not have and do not want to explain to their wishes how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindukush sub-region.
Another factor that is able to deal radically with the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions on Iran do not work, the United States will face an overwhelming question, whether to try to solve the military problem.
It will have to be answered at a time when, according to Obama, America will move towards a successful landing from Afghanistan.
Any such solution, however, will also mean a dramatic turn in the Afghan situation.
The only obstacle to Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years remaining in the presidential elections, and therefore there is still enough time to come up with another strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Bank managers Goldman Sachs no longer get cash rewards
The senior executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash in this year.
She announced this to the company that reacts to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 front managers will get money instead of shares that will be available in five years' time.
In addition, shares may be taken by managers in case they are over-risked.
Goldman Sachs thus, according to the Reuters agency, makes efforts to connect the rewards on Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to be issued, the former investment banker JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in detail, he added.
The Goldman Sachs Bank became a target of criticism after it paid nearly $17 billion (about CZK 300 billion) in the first three quarters of this year.
According to the Reuters agency, the total amount of remuneration in the company for this year is likely to exceed $20 billion, despite the measures announced today.
High wages in the banking sector have become a hot political issue in a number of countries as a result of the financial crisis.
On Wednesday, Britain announced that the bankers’ bonuses of over 25,000 pounds (about 712,000 CZK) intend to impose a lump sum of fifty-percent tax.
Similar steps are being made by France.
This year women won the Nobel Prize in all except physics
The record of five women in Stockholm today took over from the hand of Swedish King Carl XVI. Gustafa this year's Nobel Prize in professional categories and literature.
Among them were four German writers of Romanian origin Hert Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded by two American biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their countryman Jack Szostok, for research in the field of chromosomes.
The price for chemistry was received by Israel's Ada Jonathan along with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of fisheries.
The final award was Nobel's prize for the economy won by American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson for an analysis of economic governance.
The only professional category that came around this year without a holder was physics.
Today, scientists Charles As for optical fiber research and George Smith with Willard Boyl for the invention of a CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical remote views.
Each rating took over the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of financial reward.
It reaches ten million Swedish crowns in each category (approximately 25 million CZK).
If there is more in each of them, the reward is shared.
Traditionally the most unexpected Nobel Peace Prize has been received by Norwegian President Barack Obama this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appreciation, for it was only at the beginning of his career that he stood in the forefront of the country, leading two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defending his policy, he added that wars are in a certain situation necessary for peace-keeping, even though the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering the demise. Klaus invited him to the Garden.
President Václav Klaus will adopt, on Friday morning, Finance Minister Eduardo Janota, who considers the government's collapse because he disagrees with the image of the state budget for the next year as approved by the Ambassador's House on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and maybe Janot's break-in in the office will be the subject of their Friday meetings.
The budget also criticises Klaus.
According to him, there is too high a deficit, which further deepens the public finances crisis.
The meeting was briefed by the president's spokesman, Radim Ohvat.
Janota wants to deal with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the Budget Act, which will now be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should be managed with 163 billion crowns.
However, on Wednesday, the House approved the left-hand proposals for money transfers and raised the money for the salaries of state employees, for the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has put forward proposals for social democracy by concealing the budget deficit.
Between the left-hand side of one and the government, Klaus and the right-hand side of the other, there was an acute internal political dispute, which started to raise a question about the further influence of Fischer's official office, whose formation in the spring had been agreed by the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was adopted by the House, essentially eliminates the package of savings measures that Fischer's government has put into effect in the autumn and that it is intended to suspend the state's debt.
Klaus, who can, but also does not have to sign the state budget law, said at this morning's discussion with the entrepreneur that politicians have been neglecting "a serious problem", which is "an unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
He doesn't have a good solution today.
The improvement could only be brought by a strong government that could, in addition, rely on a broader consensus of the political parties, my president.
The President of the ODS Mirek Topolánek stated that the budget is scary and the government should consider further existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr said that the concept of an official office with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and green ones is clearly no longer working.
Prime Minister Fischer said similar words for "strong years".
Chief of ČSSD Jiří Paroubek responded to Topońka's words that the budget deficit, which was prepared by the former government of Topońkov for this year and which exceeds 200 billion crowns, was terrible.
On Wednesday, ČSSD already marked the approval of the state budget for the following year as a success.
The people were calm, too.
Mandel in Clint Eastwood's paper played Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: Unbeatable will tell the world a lot about the country, about its struggle and victory despite some critics that the main roles are made by American actors.
The story will tell about sport, race and Nelson Mandel.
A tireless fighter against the racist regime of apartheid in the South African Republic and its first black President Nelson Mandel in his life story is an Oscar American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that ninety-nine-year-old Mandela asked him if he could make it in Eastwood's movie.
Another important role in it is Matt Damon.
I told him, 'If I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
A twenty-seven-year-old actor who won the role of the Eastwood drama from the Million Dollar Baby box, has already produced, for example, a leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which he eventually became a slave, a fictional president of the United States, and even a god in the Divine Evans, but only a few people who still live and are as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was 27 years in prison for his active work to end the apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released for freedom in 1990 and then for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded.
Invictus is a Latin word for unbeatable and is the title of English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The picture is a true story of Nelson Mandela joining forces with the captain of the South African football team Francois Pinaar to help unite the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation remains after the apartheid still racially and economically divided.
He believes that he can connect his people through sports, so he decides to unite the players of the race who belong to the world-wide dimension between the outside.
The South African team will finally join the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandel's story on canvas.
I had no other goal than to play this role so that I could get as close to it as possible, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
Herec said that if he and the world politics were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, dinner with him, be in the background before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted Mandel to shake his hand.
I found out that when I print your hand, I take over your energy, it transmits, and I felt like I knew how you felt, said.
It's important for me to try to be with another person.
Matt Damon is making a film in Françoise Pienaara, the captain of the national football team, where white players were considered.
He said he had six months to prepare for his role in a tough race world.
It was a great surprise for him to finally meet Pinaar at his house.
I remember how I rang the home bell, he opened up to me, and the first thing I said to François Pinaar in my life was, "I look a lot bigger in the movie."
Despite the obvious differences in the characters of the actors compared to their actual submissions led by director Eastwood, Invictus: Unavoided positive review and also about the ambitions of Oscar.
The movie critic of the Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, shorted his evaluation into the words: "It was a very good story, a very well done film."
In film reviews on the rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received 76% of positive reviews.
The secret of the strike over Norway is solved: Russians tested the rocket
Over Norway, it was possible to observe the special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only admitted yesterday that it was not far from the Norwegian border that it tested the intercontinental ballistic missile.
However, the start was again unsuccessful and shot marked as "Bulava" type, which was originally to be the crumbling of the Russian army, slowly becoming the black sea of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in the rocket tests did not have a corresponding effect on the success of the test years.
Most of the storm didn't come up or get hurt in the air.
In Russian newspapers, "Bulava" is already written as "a rocket that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This in the 13th series has been a normal start.
By the end of the year, there was a technical damage to the apparatus.
Apparently the engine exploded in a third-degree rocket.
This time "Bulava" started from the atomic ponorka Dmitrij Donski, which floated under the white sea.
This type of rocket allows to be fired from a vessel that is moving and at the same time down.
That's why it's likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was actually broken by "Bulva".
The rest of the Norns have never doubted the Russian missile since the first time.
Generals are defending themselves this time and they claim that it is not possible to speak clearly of failure.
The first two degrees of rockets were sustained and the accident reached to the third.
In the previous cases, the engines failed immediately to the first degree.
Even though no attempt was made without a mistake, only six out of thirteen were considered unsuccessful by the Ministry of Defence.
Nearly 50% of the success of the generals therefore fills with optimism and still claims that "Bulava" will fly once without problems and even take up to ten hyssop nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed a 51-year contract in CSKA Moscow
The legendary defender of Vjačeslav Fetisov is again presented in a professional hockey game in 51 years.
The former world champion, the Olympic winner and holder of Stanley Cup will help his team in need of CSKA Moscow and will probably be on the Friday duel of KHL against Petrohrad.
Fetisov, who finished his career in the '40s in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljaš has been injured, we need another defender.
Fetisov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We just need to deal with some formal issues, quoted by the agency AP of the Moscow club's "Sergeje Germany".
It's not clear yet whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will be dealing with just one match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can raise the spirit of the other players, he told the Germans.
Fetisov thus becomes the oldest Russian professional hockeyist, according to the AP, in the event of a return to ice.
In the NHL, he won the whole season for Hartford's legendary attacker Gordie Howe and enrolled 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union's dress, he won two Olympic gold, seven titles of the world's champion, triumphed over Canada Cup and a junior world championship.
In the second part of his career, he also had success in the NHL, where he took over Stanley Cup twice in Detroit's dress.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Sinoh hockey.
Hyundai has told the board.
The management of Hyundai's car with the committees agreed to cancel all overtime.
It was precisely because of the often planned overtime that the committees announced on Monday's emergency.
Confirmed the speakers' car Hyundai Petr Vaněk.
However, management wants to agree with the experts on another Saturday shift.
We can't go back to our production plan, which is essential, so a voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19th, by making two changes, Vaněk said.
Server Sedmika.cz wrote that the company of employees who are working on the Saturday shift offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
That'll get people back on Saturday, November 28th.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the motivation of employees for the proposed overtime.
Whether they allow themselves to pay the supplement in advance or they can choose a replacement on December 28th, thus extending their holiday holidays by day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all employees will receive paid travel and lunch on Saturdays.
In view of the fact that overtime was the most urgent and most flammable point in terms of the comments and complaints of the experts, and of the protesting employees who had stopped the production alive last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with the immediate effect of cancelling all overtimes on December, Vaněk said.
The car employees were forced to work twice a week almost every day after the eight-hour shift.
After signing the agreement, the Committee shall withdraw the emergency
Further negotiations between car management and experts are scheduled to take place on Friday morning.
The Head of the Committees Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the post.
The situation in the car came to an end last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously arrived due to unrelenting weather.
They also protested against the wrong payment conditions and alleged fraud.
The management reiterated that in the meantime employees must work to meet the requirements for the supply of cars.
In their Monday statement, the experts also requested that no sanctions be imposed on employees who interrupted the production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, the company's committees require that it reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay $5,000 for it this year.
The Hyundai car now employs 2,000 people.
The company's serial production started last November.
By September, it produced about 80,000 cars, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars a year.
Czech detection: a substance that also carries on 'accursed' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of improved substances is that it also takes on viruses that have already been obtained against immunosuppressive drugs.
This fact in some cases is outweighed by the fact that the combination on the common variant of the virus does not work as strongly as some of the medicines already available.
I can't cure AIDS until now.
However, patients can significantly prolong the life-long life-long combination of medicines that prevent the reproduction of HIV virus in the body.
However, their use has a number of side effects.
In addition, the incomplete suppression of the virus has resulted in the development of so-called resistant viruses against which medicines are already ineffective.
The work of experts from the three institutions of the Czech Academy of Sciences, the VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that the substances called metallic carborene affect the protein responsible for multiplying the HIV virus.
Metal carborates are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus other than all the medicines used today and may therefore overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come with new ‘improvement’ compounds prepared based on the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
Metalcarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-layered cells made of boron, hydrogen and carbon are bound by metal, in this case by cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus that is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by HIV suppression, mature viral particles would not occur.
When we stop HIV protease, we stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, explain the scientists in the press report issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In the work published in the journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are combined with a short organic chain, which is further systematically modified.
Something weaker, but more reliable.
The effect of this series of anti-HIV protease agents was tested in the faeces and also against its persistent (resistant) variants from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metallic carboran on the usual variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinical medicinal products, but does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which the medicinal products are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of effect and also its other characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical adjustments, make it interesting links for further research aimed at the proposal of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlín Zezáčová, the leading laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The deal for the budget, the ODS went to Fischer, the one who defends himself.
Chief of ODS Mirek Topolánek designated the approved budget for next year as "fearsome" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should consider further existence, according to him.
The statement by the ODS was made by the President of the Government for strong years.
He's leaving time for his analysis.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr said that the concept of an official office with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
The President of the Government must decide, according to the Rules of Procedure, whether he intends to take care of a minority in the House, which is either a struggle against the growing deficit, or a reduction in the function by means of a parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and social democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, he pointed out the lack of time.
The budget for 2010 was adopted by the House on Wednesday, with the left-wing proposals for more than 12 billion crowns.
Szymovna has raised money for the salaries of civil servants, for the operation of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government's influence on the social democracy proposal address was, however, that they cover the budget deficit in secret.
The PRC should manage 163 billion kroner.
The ODS left the hall before the vote, expressing the Government's wish that the revised budget was even less bad than the budget.
Disillusionment and vanity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of the disappointment and feeling of emptiness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government is still evaluating the situation.
Sometimes it is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to leave the office in the event of the adoption of the amendments, the situation might look different.
According to Czech TV, Janota ordered on Monday after the government to the prime minister.
He indicated that he was considering further interruptions in the function.
That's why he's disappointed in the budget.
If Fischer is speaking for another battle with the budget deficit, they do not, according to the Untimely Government, do what the ČSSD nominees have done, which has passed the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will issue a demise if the House approves other laws of increasing deficits, such as those relating to sickness, income, or the news of the service law.
Topolynek: Ministers of appointment of ODS did not originate
It's the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ODS nomination ministers did nothing wrong, highlighted Topolánek in the US text report.
He recalled that in several ministries, people are voting to TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Not long ago, he stressed that if Fischer decides to resign to the principle of combating the high level of public finances, "it is quite logical and correct that he is taking care of the left-wing majority that is currently in the warehouse".
But then he can't count on the support and tolerance of the civil Democrats.
I didn't think about it, and when it's up to date, I'm going to dedicate myself to it, he told reporters in the House of Defense Minister Martin Barták, who were appointed to the government by the citizens of the Democratic Republic.
Prime Minister Fischer left this afternoon for the European Council in Brussels.
At the request of the Prime Minister of the ODS, he stopped
At the same time, he stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in the House, unless the Prime Minister of the Member of the Civil Democrats specifically requested that they allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not appear to be poor, we are not young children, then we have responded to the question of whether the ODS did not challenge the presence of the chairman of Parliament and the Czech Republic in the political debate on the budget.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
As soon as I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the months to come, first of all, the Bolsheviks and the destruction of everything positive, had responded to Topolánek himself.
According to the new ČD order, less trains will go for almost the same drivers
The Czech route from 13 December will cancel or limit some less-laden speeds and localities, other connections will boost.
From the date of entry into force of the new schedule, the total volume of transport shall be reduced by two per cent compared to today.
Most tariffs including basic and customer drivers will not change.
For example, the people of Ostravska get more options for connecting to the main city, and the routes on this track add one set of pendolins.
The speedboat will stop driving to Bratislava.
Less fasts also go on the trail of Prague - Pisek - České Budějovice, mainly the direct connections of Prague - Letohrad.
From the regions, they plan the biggest reduction of traffic in the King's Land, with a total of eight per cent, on the contrary, they can enjoy Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains on the Praha - Tábor - České Budějovice route and the operation of several speeds on the Praha - Písek - České Budějovice route are limited to a few days a week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovic to Prague, today the Milovichtí must pass to Lysé nad Lab.
It is the fifteenth link of the city system Esko, its opening is possible due to the completion of the electricity line from Lysé nad Lab to Milovac.
Remote connections to the main city will end at the Prague Main Station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Shumperka/Iseník will go at two hours intervals.
From December 13th to Bratislava, the passengers are no longer bound.
This year's account for regional railways: 200 million more
He quickly orders and pays the Ministry of Transport, in total for the compensation of the so-called demonstrable loss, giving the expensive next year four billion crowns, as well as this year. Locals order countries, in total, will pay for them next year eight billion crowns, which will contribute to the state of non-three billion countries.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
Locals and fasts have a newly concluded ten-year contract, so far there has always been a contract for one year.
The routes are complimenting the system, and therefore they are not likely to be able to increase the prices of the dry majority of vehicles.
The changes only come with single-day CZ Net and cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For travellers without a customer card, the price of CD Net is increased from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLišky will be new from a long distance, so far has been the only one for the road between any rural cities and made 160 crowns.
The Philippines’s armed forces still hold over 50 people, children released
Today, the armed forces in the south of the Philippines have taken 75 people, including a number of elementary school students and their teachers.
It was introduced by the AFP agency, which initially only informed about 65 abducted persons.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 armed men are using hostages as a living shield when fleeing from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the issue of remaining hostages.
According to the AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the police had initially prosecuted kidnapping for the violence they had requested to settle accounts between the two local family clans.
In the province of Maguindanao in southern Philippines, a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed was declared to be permanent.
There were 30 journalists among the victims of the massacre of November 23 concerning elections to the Government Office.
The governor and his father Andal Ampatuan, an influential patriarch of the Ampatuan province, were arrested for suspecting involvement in the massacre.
On the island of Mindanao are also active Muslim separatists.
But they renewed their peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of JAR concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days, a new Hollywood film, Clint Eastwood Invictus (official name in Czech is Invictus: Undefeated), which captures part of the life story of former President Nelson Mandela of South Africa.
The role of a world-famous fighter against apartheid was set aside by Morgan Freeman, who chose Mandela himself for his creation years ago.
The next male role of the legendary South African champion in the back of Francoise Pienaara was replaced by Matt Damon.
By showing the picture in the movies, they stand out from the voices of criticisms and the public
Nelson Mandela
The full name of Nelson Rolikhlah Mandela was born on July 18, 1918, in the South African Union.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 with the Nobel Prize for Peace with De Klerke.
He was President of the South African Republic between 1994 and 1999.
high expectations, as it comes to the public at a time when in the South African Republic, however, preparations for a world championship in football are at the top, but the media are also exacerbating disturbing reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination by the black-dominated majority.
According to the AP, the announcements to a new film in JAR for the time being are positive, even though numerous awards are made to capture the main roles of "proflict" Hollywood stars.
However, Morgan Freeman is proud of the new movie according to his words.
I've been dreaming of that role for years, and I've been well prepared for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela personally many times to, as it is said, consume his energy, talk after the film premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can mention Mandel's personality and message in the film.
It's the story of the South African Republic, but it's about everyone, he added.
In the course of the national rugby team
Image based on a book presentation by British writer John Carlin with a freely translated title In the role of enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that gave rise to the nation portraits the South African human rights stand during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman is therefore trying to stifle two races in the course of the film, and for many years the mutually defined population groups and as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, he is also taking part in the heroic role of the South African national rugby dress in the world Cup game, which JAR won at the time.
For the entrance to the lawn in a dress, which is almost understood in JAR as something sacred, Mandela made a large sheep mostly white audience fourteen years ago and gained recognition of the white population.
The football championship, perhaps able to reunite people into one nation, introduced the rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in 1995 in the national team.
Whether the situation in the JAR gets better, it'll just show up.
The white South Africans, however, are skeptical, as an example in the recent LN interview, produced by Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain.
The Championship will begin on June 11, 2010.
On Lounsk, a transformer burns tens of millions of crowns
In the morning, the transformer of the company Čeps in the divorce center of Výškov village in Lousk.
In the fire, according to the speaker of the local firemen, Lucas Marvana has six units.
The firemen originally wanted to let the transformer burn out, but later they reevaluated the opinion and fire threw away mixtures of water, foam and special masking substances.
The reason was a technical failure, the internal shock of the transformer.
No one was injured, the accident, according to Paully Mandat’s spokesman, does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at tens of millions of crowns, exactly counting it will work until the fire is over.
The destroyed transformer will have to replace it with a new one, according to the Mandate.
After ten years of operation of the Ceps, nothing like it happened, the errors of this type were isolated, complemented.
The supply of electricity was not affected by the operation of households, offices or companies by the traffic station fires, according to Czech spokesman Soni Holinger’s Hendrichs.
A.s. The cap acts on the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive operator of the transmission system, electric control 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 divorces with 67 transformers converting electricity from transmission to distribution system and the pipelines of 4339 kilometers long.
Janchura gives a criminal notice for a three-heitman talk from ČSSD
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Janchura today gives a criminal notice for the talk on three social-democratic heitmanies.
And that's Michael Haška from the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínka from the Pardubic Region and the Heitman of the Olomouc province of Martin Tessarík.
Janchura set it up at the Radio Journal in twenty minutes.
The complaint relates to the company's efforts to operate regional train transport in some countries.
All regions, however, have finally signed long-term agreements with the Czech Dragons.
All three heitmans are attacking us and talking about choosing roses, while we've only made an offer for what they wanted.
They claim that we are dearer than the Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the prices of the Czech Railways, which were closed last week.
So we don't get out of here until we defend ourselves.
It's for an interview with the Student Agency, said Janchura Radio Journal.
At the same time, he stated that he had evidence from all countries that they did not take their steps in accordance with European law.
He is therefore preparing to propose to the European Commission.
Mr. Janchury's continued media show, which serves him as an unpaid advertising of his company and his own.
I am, of course, prepared to raise the good name of my country and of my country and to the same challenge as the other Heitmans.
I assume that even on this occasion it will be clear that it is Mr Janchura who manipulates the public and uses false and false arguments in the area of regional rail transport, Hasek has introduced.
Jancura announced last week that she was investing several million crowns in advertising, which would be an unfavourable step in countries.
The newspaper said that after Christmas, the campaign will be interrupted and continued after New Year's Eve.
He explained that the campaign would be directed against corruption like that.
The campaign began after the countries agreed to operate regional railway connections with the Czech Dragons and the order about 150 billion crowns did not produce trends.
According to Jancury, the same proceedings are illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
As a result of the criticism of train transport in Janchure countries, he has already put the MP at risk for the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we don't let it go, we can get a bus license.
He represented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know which gentleman he's talking about, I won't say his name, said Janchura Radio Journal today.
Pneumococcal expectations will be free and non-compulsory
Expectation against pneumonia from the ice will break the usual habits.
It's supposed to be the first for families to be free and at the same time unencumbered.
But there are already rumors that it would be more effective to expect.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination.
The medicinal product has already set maximum prices for vaccines which will be paid by the health insurance company.
The experts are also clear in the process of choking.
New Circumstances
Free vaccines for children in August
From January they may be treated free of charge against children who were born on or after 2 August.
The condition is that they haven't received a single dose of choking yet.
Whoever started to heal last year or earlier has to pay for another one.
The first dose should be given between 3 and 5 months of age.
She voluntarily left her children a quarter of a family to fight pneumonia last year.
At the time, the parents paid 1,600 crowns for one dose and more.
Four doses are needed when the youngest children are breast-feeding.
In general, experts estimate that health insurances spend between 300 and 450 thousand crowns a year.
But they will save for the treatment that children would need without their parents.
So far, he has given about 500 grand a year to all the childish expectations.
The so-called Janoto package has been introduced.
Pneumococcal causes central ear inflammation, but also serious infections including strokes of the brain and blood vessels.
We're going to die of pneumonia every year, according to a hospital investigation, up to 28 children under 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic, children have been subjected to widespread pneumococcal harassment in 40 countries.
Is it going to be mandatory?
At the same time, however, opinions appear that this expectation might be mandatory in the future.
From the ice, it's supposed to be covered by insurance and non-compulsory.
For example, Nałas Rudolf Kalovský, head of the civil society.
His pneumococcal vaccine association has been promoting for a long time.
The experts at the international conference, which our association participated, were not fully satisfied with our voluntary expectations.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are pleased that at least this has happened.
I think it's the path that we need to go to now, brought in by the Kalovski.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination procedure.
At this point, we do not consider it at all, his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeně said.
Voluntary expectations have its disadvantages, hard doctors
The president of the Professional Society of Practical Doctors Hana Cabrnochová recognizes that he has a voluntary expectation of his disadvantages.
If all children were injured, it might be considered to reduce the number of overdoses "For a situation where this vaccine is so high, we understand relatively the political decision that the vaccination was dismissed as voluntary," says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that he will be able to treat his quays against pneumonia from next year more than 80 percent of fresh parents.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also a breakthrough in the fact that, as the first flat vaccination of children, there is a health insurance system, not state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, save for further treatment, explains Cabrnoch.
Doctors will have to buy drugs on their own.
However, it is related to the concerns of practical children’s doctors involved in the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original purpose, vaccines should be purchased by insurance companies, and doctors should receive them as much as the state supplies them to other occupiers.
However, some Members were afraid that insurance companies could "deduct money from health insurance".
Doctors will therefore have to buy substances and wait for them to be paid.
According to estimates, individual practitioners will invest in vaccines 40,000 a month, which is a significant amount.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnoch.
The son of an American artist 'stealed in the museum'
The son of the renowned American inventor, Frank Frazetta, was accused of trying to steal images worth $20 million (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Police in Pennsylvania reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 images into his vehicle and trailer.
Mr. Frazetta and the other man used to break into the museum in the Poconco Mountains Bagr region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81 years old, celebrated the creation of the character Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time it happened, the artist was in Florida, as the press agency Associated Press reported.
The AP quoted an unnamed police officer as saying that Mr. Frasetta's younger could have been motivated by long-term family disputes.
In front of the police, Mr. Frazetta issued a younger sworn statement, 52 years old, that he did so at his father's advice, "to get to the museum in any way possible and move images into the ice-cream," the agency said.
Mr. Frazetta the senior refused to grant any such authorization as the agency had indicated.
Labourers defend the planned increase of taxes
The Ministers advocated the increase in taxes and cuts in expenditure announced in the preliminary report on the budget against criticism by the opposition, entrepreneurs and committees.
According to Alistair Darling, the Torys have "painted" the possibility to show that they mean a serious postponement of the decision to reduce the deficit until a time after the elections.
And the office got under fire because of the injuries of low- and middle-income workers.
According to its proposal, 0.5 % of social security growth and 1 % of the adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Dissolvement of social insurance
The committees protested that low-income workers were punished for a recession that they did not commit and warned against "problems".
Social insurance is increasing - about 3 billion pounds a year - which has driven the community of entrepreneurs, who have stated that it is a tax from employment, while it should focus on economic recovery.
This increase, which limits these revenues to more than 20 000 pounds per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
Key BODS PBR
Social insurance will be increased by another 0,5 % since April 2011
The economic situation is getting worse by 4,75 % this year than expected.
New tax 50% of bankers' bonuses
Growth 1% of company tax for small companies
Tax reduction for electric motors and wind turbines
Increase in income measurement by 2,5 %
According to the estimate, some revenues of 30000 pounds are reduced by 90 pounds a year and some revenues of 40000 pounds are reduced by 190 pounds, while some revenues of 10000 pounds are increasing by 110 pounds.
The Ministers announced that their target of half-deficit reduction by 2013 was "complicated decision-making", but they argued that 60% of the special tax should fall to 5% of those with the highest income.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms argued that the proposed increase in taxes and expenditure limitation would be "a drop in the ocean" compared to what would have to be done.
"These are large numbers, which enables us to reduce the half deficit, which is an absolutely basic requirement for the next four years," the BBC said.
Mr Timms stated that he was convinced that economic growth should come at the end of the year.
But drawing up a forecast for future economic growth - which will affect the volume of the necessary loans and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be a barrier after the official has been forced to review the previous amounts.
In the opinion, the decrease in the economy was 4,75 % this year - far worse than the 3,5 % reduction predicted in April - because loans were 3 billion pounds higher than previously estimated.
Prolonged opportunity'
The conservatives who launched a new promotion campaign on Thursday, warning against the "debt crisis" of laborers, marked the planned loan of 789 billion pounds over the next six years as insurmountable.
Ministers failed to submit a credible plan as to how it could be paid, added, "cynic" postponed this decision until after the elections - which must be held by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant to what would be feasible," said the shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had the chance to do it, but they blinded it."
"All important announcements will be made by election if we win them "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labourers insist that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future scarfs unlike the Tory's proposals, which would want to reduce the deficit faster and to a greater extent.
But liberal Democrats argue that the money obtained by increased taxes and spending cuts should be used to support expenditure in the coming year rather than to reduce the deficit, and argue that the plans are "based on sand".
The BBC political commentator Nick Robinson stated that time was coming for the announcement - for example, the above inflation is rising and will result in the inability to pay the dose in the next April - that it could lead to the election campaign's indictment if the money was hard to get back a year later.
But laborers are continuing to provide special assistance if they need it very much and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
Suspect budget'
Although the Ministers did not disclose the details of expenditure after 2011, the economists stated that it is clear that reductions in public expenditure would only be due to the beginning of medium-term constraints.
The recognised Institute of Budgetary Studies has reported that office figures indicate significant gaps in many areas, potentially in the building include transport, higher education and defence.
"It's really painful so far," said his director Robert Chote.
"All important statements will come after the elections if we win them," Roger Bootle, an economic adviser to the Deloitte bookstore, added.
"It was a report on the suspect preliminary budget, and markets are implementing it."
FBI conducts investigations in 'American Prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI investigates five Americans suspected of connecting to extremists in Pakistan.
Men were arrested for attack on the house in Sargoda in the province of eastern Punjabi, as reported by the BBC to the U.S. embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI reported that it was investigating whether it was the same men who were declared unrecognizable in the last month in their home country in the United States of Virginia.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs has stated that it is also about obtaining information about these men.
Three of them are said to be the origin of Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian ancestors, and the other comes from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and the circumstances under which they were detained," said Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit announced that the agencies were informed of the arrest and were in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are really wrong students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington stated that men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
It stated that the house was always in the middle of local police interest and that the charges were not yet brought against the men in custody.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Hillry Clinton refused to comment on the arrest, announced the press agency Reuters, but stated that the United States must "cooperate much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in the discovery of the terrorist infrastructure that continues in the recruitment and training of persons".
The disappearance of these five students from home in northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Refusing amnesty for Iranian tyrants.
The situation in respect of human rights in Iran is as bad as in the last 20 years as the Amnesty International's export report.
The report describes in detail "the methods of torture" in the regime before and after the controversial presidential elections in June.
One man said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected the above criticism of this report on the observance of human rights.
Officials have identified this criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people were arrested and tens of them were killed after the contested election of President Mahmúd Ahmadine, which led to the greatest street demonstration since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Ten of them were imprisoned, and the prosecutors sentenced the last five people to death.
The BBC writer in Tehran John Leyne, now located in London, stated that earlier in protests, the senior leader of Ayatollah Ali Chomejní declared some forms of torture invalidity and prohibited their implementation in Karizak correctional facilities.
But since then, almost no criticism of the legal power has been tolerated, as our writer stated.
False confession.
Amnesty International quoted the report of a 26-year-old student in the field of computer technology by Ibrahim Methari, who stated that he was accused of "working with Facebook network" and of protests against election results.
"Many times they were in my face," he said in a statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head, threatened me with correction and humiliated me."
After five days he signed false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty reported.
In August, the presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubí was defeated after the protests were held after the elections and was sentenced to death in prison and the others were raped.
The Iranian senior state officials rejected the charges of rape, but admitted that torture had taken place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who stated that he was held in a container with 75 other persons for a period of more than eight weeks in Kahrizak prison.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and justice had set up committees to investigate election concerns and government reactions, but stated that the mandate and authority of the authorities were unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The Group stated that at least 90 people were detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
In the city park, a ski lift was created
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to change the memory in Bristol in the main race track.
The main race route to the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prices.
At the top of the train station in Brandon Hill Park was a short ski resort 100 metres away from the train station.
A fourth-year-old medical student John Hickman said it was a wonderful view from the top of the highway, but it was really exciting.
It was a beautiful view of the bright lights of the city down.
Here were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them real talents," he added.
The prices were awarded for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the highway.
After a Thursday night's competition, the snow was left to take off.
They're still with us.
Can he be a Muslim French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in the secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters called for a ban on the construction of minerals and generally spread horrendous reports about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, the American Academy wrote and informed and wondered whether Muslims could integrate - and whether they were integrated - into one of the most unopened secular societies of the continent.
After reading this book, some readers became admirers of the author's latest work, "Why France doesn't like the hats on its head" (2006), this elegant and debated study on controversial issues that divide and employ the country for 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a broader and much more ambitious picture.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what the politicians and the media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened on the basis.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutions, which are now looking after 5 to 6 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic Spaces".
He's a good listener, he reproduces debates between teachers and students on questions that are most concerned about them.
Should Muslims enter the marriage union in a mosque or in a council (or in both places)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the development and rights of gays?
Can a Muslim marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does Muslims have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system to obtain a mortgage?
These seem to be the world's controversial issues that are being debated and that are part of everyday life rather than the political dramas that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of images, teachers and intellectuals, among other commonly known persons, excluding Tarika Ramadan, Araba, Muslim researcher and academia, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a discussion on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in modern secular society at the same time.
They have no arguments for all their customs.
Conservatives are unreliable about the true idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists with whom Mr Bowen conducted the interview agree that this group is small, but affects European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
The question is how far French politicians (and intellectual elites who are so viciously defending the secular public) are really given the idea of pluralism.
It is the view that Muslims have probably less experience in the matter of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to compromise historically with secular republics.
More than the development of pragmatism has found "the removal of screws of values".
After reading this book, someone may have a tendency to say, "Yes, but not now."
The Most Dissatisfying Views in the World
The Arctic is changing faster than the other environments of the planet.
The limiting ice is the alarming speed, which affects animals and their survival as nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fisheries companies must be focused on new natural water sources, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers when they wake up.
In the book "On thin ice" Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, presents the natural history of the North icon, polar bear.
Well-informed of the complicated history and the procedures of the Maghreb, it describes the long tradition of polar researchers who tried to strengthen the white bear.
The admiral Nelson's meeting with a brave 14-year-old swimmer who was fighting only with a shell of mosquitoes is really myth, but all the others are true.
Young bears who were swimming behind their dead mothers' bodies were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears appeared suddenly in a circus state.
Even today the fences in the zoo typically have a million times smaller area than the area available to adults in the wilderness. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the lower hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis is exhausting from the work of other writers and historians and often returns to the danger that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Although hunting is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where they hunt from helicopters and Indians on skis, and all are armed with powerful attacking gloves that shoot their own profit.
Ironically, it's taking place in the water north of these two hunting nations and the ice will finally be the largest.
In his new book "After Ice", Alun Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and unsatisfied responsibility for the Arctic science and a perfunctory summer view of how the future can change it.
Not all scientists have answers.
Neither meteorologists nor oceanographers have an adequate response to the rate of change.
It's for lack of testing.
The research trails of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th century indicated how the ice is moving.
The winter wars were followed by the sinking of the sinks when they were submerged.
Satellite research and extensive probes in floating glaciers are a useful supplement, but many are still being conducted thanks to the safe individuals who camp in winter.
Mr. Anderson is looking into the extremely fragile world of the Arctic ice floor system, created by the flow of salt water that melts when frozen.
But from the height of this bear to the microscopic wonders, all of this is doomed to decay as the summer ice moves, which sometimes takes place between 2013 and 2050.

6,000 members of the seabed have laid their hands on the graves in Arlington
Lieutenant De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours by bus to place a simple gift on the grave of a soldier he never met.
For him and the other seamen who took a trip from Johnson camp in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington, to recover the graves, that was the day when they kept men and women who once wore the same shoes.
In a few months' time, we can do that, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If it happens to us, I'd like someone to do the same for me to show me respect just as I try to do it.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered this Saturday morning to put the devotees at the funeral of veterans in several departments during a Friday act in Arlington.
In 1992 Morril Worcester, the owner of Worcester's funeral company in Harrington, in Maine, initiated this tradition when he and several others decided to celebrate several hundred graves during a Friday act in Arlington.
Now it's an 18-year-old tradition when Mr. nMorill and his wife Karen take this journey every year and stop in different cities along the way to remember members of the army and victims of terrorism.
Worcesters don't look for any profit in it, they don't want it in America, which they own in other countries.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 Vences in the Arlington cemetery, the Pentagon area, the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and 93 United Airlines in the state of Pennsylvania.
For the second year, Walmart's donation is more than $150,000 for the purchase and transport of the vertebrae.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, stated that she had made a trip to Arlington to honor her husband, a retired member of the armed forces.
Because her husband was not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said it was her way back to what the victim was doing.
It's a small way that citizens can support our units, she said.
It's like a family grave visit.
Roasted in hot-substance plazas, volunteers went through the cemetery after the surrounding lawns and pahorices.
Volunteers turned to older graves from the First and Second World Wars and the Vietnam Wars, because these are not visited as often as the newer graves
Nadalda was positive when the children played and held their hands together when they carried a young boar to our burial stones.
Each round dish was dark green with a little red doll on the top of the dog.
Close to section 60, where most veterans from war in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, have remained truly quiet.
The United Service Organizations dedicated 1,000 volunteers to the heating department, but the cloudy moods of the war just under way filled this area.
Some sincerely cried, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in cold air.
Some read the name out loud in the rocks, while others agreed to look at the small black names, pressed into the wet mud where the burial stones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who shed tears in front of her son's grave.
She spent eight hours from Zanesfield in Ohio to visit the last resting place of Sergeant David Shane Spicer's headquarters, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free. ..my son paid for it, rules.

U.S. government supplier arrested by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government imprisoned an American government supplier who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, as foreign ministry officials introduced on Saturday.
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, together with the American section of interest in Havana, sought access to the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
A certain charge was not published, but according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner may be imprisoned for almost anything that is referred to as "dangerous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical states, pose a risk of imprisonment.
Anticipating graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are monitored and harassed by government agents.
Mrs. Sánchez repeatedly requested permission to leave the country so that she could take over the prices, but her permission was denied.
The detention of an American supplier may be the result of a growing tension between the Communist Castro brother, who is ruling Cuba, and Obama's administration, which was followed as "maintenance tactics" in improving relations with the island.
As the first reporter to report on the New York Times' arrest on Friday night.
The new American policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and creates more room for opposition, the United States will take reciprocal action.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although these are new and sought-in codes in the country where the average wage of the state employee is $15 per month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones right this year; these are used mostly by sending text messages, because a 15-minute phone call would be more than one day’s wages.
Internet use on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and in some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to sign up must announce their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
The detention of the American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind the thresholds for drug trafficking, according to Gloria Berben, the press office of the Section for American Interests in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide more information about the prison.
The arrest and detention were clearly immoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open company - let's say free mobile phones - are a criminal offence in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the American Human Rights Programme, who recently published a negative report on Cuba's freedoms, called "New Castro, Tataz Cuba", as an intervention on Raula Castro's installation as the leader of the country and a reward for the Cuban older brother Fidel.
Vivanco stated that the defendants were often arrested, imprisoned and imprisoned within one day.
He stated that all the solutions would be more political and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, just as these two countries are moving towards a wider dialogue.
Pakistani government officials cover a conspiracy concerning the sending of men to Afghanistan.
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities discovered the alleged leader of a conspiracy concerning the dispatch of five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill the members of the American units there, and stated that they hoped that this case could help to discover a wide network of terrorists who follow the Internet and search for radicalised young men.
The investigators stated that they were searching for the gray rebel personalities, known as Saifulláh, who invited these men to Pakistan after he first discovered when one of these men published a comment approving terrorist attacks has a YouTube video page.
Saifillah took the lead of these men as soon as they came to Pakistan, and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan in the indigenous tribes of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaeda and its camps for the training of terrorists.
But the Pakistani reporter who reported the case stated on Saturday that Saifulláh was unsuccessful in certifying the commanders of al-Qaeda and that men were not part of the CIA attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, a few days later, they were expelled to the eastern district of Sarghoda, far from the terrible mountains in the northwest, which became a refuge for terrorists.
They were considered to be a force force.
The reason they were expelled was given by an official who spoke about keeping anonymity in view of the sensitivity of the case.
The official stated that men were not afraid and were still trying to obtain consent to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of this five - who remained in Pakistan and was questioned by the FBI - highlights the critical role of the recruits in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, which is much more important, the determination of who is reliable.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US intelligence service has given the highest priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaeda.
The organizers of the organization act as guards, excluding those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the holy war and those who might be investigators.
U.S. fake recruits were briefed at al-Qaeda's special investigation, analysts reported.
But they were also considered to be extremely interesting in the group because given their potential approach to American goals and their promotional value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, the senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more careful in recent years, allowing him to join them because US reporting agencies have gained experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to penetrate these groups, there is no better way than to act according to their recruitment model, which has already been monitored so much? Mr Kohlmann said.
This model is one of those that is far more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protested in Kodani, demanded climate action
The tens of thousands of protestors walked down the streets this Saturday and demanded more action on climate from the negotiators at the city congress centre of Bella.
Protesters have reported the number of statitarians participating in this event, but the police estimate that the number was close to 25,000.
The event was relatively quiet and a handful of masked activists placed several small stakes near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day of a small event in the United Nations climate talks, thousands of activists went through the city and carried transparency with English headlines "This is not a planet B" (i.e. a secondary) and one in Spanish, who said "The Earth says 'quit'."
The protest was attended by several celebrities, including Danish models and photographers by Helena Christensen, who stated that she had travelled to her mother’s home in Peru and provided me with information about the unhappiness of the country in which the impact of climate change is still taking place.
That is a partial reason why we have decided to join this great movement -- to go through the world and appeal to the world's leading personalities to submit a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, said.
It's not an easy task, but it's necessary to carry it out, it can't be avoided.
The police prevented the protestant from approaching the center of Bella and stated that she had detained 19 people, first of all because either they had wearing masks or they had pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during the demonstration.
According to one unaccompanied viewers who do not wish to be identified because they are involved in climate talks, masking activists like athletes and in black clothing have placed several orders near the Kodana main channel, which is located near several ministries.
They were excited about the buildings, they said, they were lighting the lights, but then they followed "some big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the television screens to watch the march in the afternoon.
But protest probably did not penetrate the knowledge of key officials, such as Su Weie, the Chinese climate negotiator.
When asked whether the demonstration still had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he answered in English "Currently, that is something that I was not aware of" (in fact it is something I do not know).
Then he went on in the Chinese and said, "Because the facts are extensive, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed whether the journey was painful or helpful depending on everyone’s prospects.
It is to see the focus of the broad public and the various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words, "It can also be said that it is a violation of the conduct or freedom of others.
The test data revealed persistent racial differences
Last week’s federal certificate of acquired knowledge of mathematics was a welcome element of good news about Columbia’s public school.
Although the district is far behind high-performance systems in the country, the certificate has shown greater progress among fourth and eighth grade students in the last two years than in the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest numbers of the National Certificate Centre for Progress in Education is the lasting differences in the knowledge gained between Africans and white students, both on the local page and on the national page.
The average score of the fourth grade white pupils in Columbia County for the last two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (from 500 possible), but only three points have been raised in their African-American levelers, from 209 to 212.
The difference in knowledge achieved has indeed increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
The progress of African Americans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with the exception of a statistically insignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The average score in white subjects was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The image in the horizon for six years is not exactly inspiring.
The difference between white and black fourth grade pupils in 2003 when the first NAEP was carried out in the county was 60 degrees (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved in children from both groups improved during this period, the difference was roughly 58.
In the last week, some district education advocates said that the results, celebrated by the secretaries of Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fentym (D) were more stimulated in white students where the results were already high.
This would suggest that we have increased the range of support for those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, executive director D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality of teaching in the county.
A member of the D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade primary school in Eaton, said that she was not jumping up and down for two or three points.
Often criticizing the style of Mrs. Rhee's administration, Mrs. Brown pointed out that the report on the results of the tests means secondary school in the city is in a desperate state and requires attention.
It's obvious that you always want to see the flaws, and I respect it.
But what's amazing is that we didn't spend almost any time and energy that we needed to devote to our high school.
Mrs. Rhee said that the effort of the county is to continue to look for better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
For example, some teachers are trained in the use of new basics, Wilson's reading system, based on students of the higher classes of primary schools and high school students who have not been able to master the basics of early reading in their careers, are significantly left behind by their teachers.
Each day's mathematics and the basics of mathematics education in the sixth grade, highlighting the real life games and experiences that came into the county as former Director of Clifford Janey, can be added to the threshold of the NAEP progress reported last week.
And I think we should continue to work and make the best efforts of those students who stay in the classrooms, Mrs. Rhee said.
Others stated that the results of NAEP explained the question whether Mrs Rhee could continue to improve the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It is a certain saved dilemma of Mrs. Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley where he studies the results of tests in urban areas.
The Conventional Correction Procedure is to focus funds and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of the territory of Colombia.
In this way, the focus can bring political upheavals that are directed against the important agenda.
However, the mark also belongs to other city directors who are trying to maintain the average diameter between white and black.
We need to focus on building a system of high schools.
We need to use our schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, can rely on their children to provide excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now the director of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that the basic element of reducing the difference between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the county in order to achieve school validity.
You have to get up to 200 days in order to make changes, said Mr. Janey, who concluded a contract with his teacher association last year for the school year in 185 days, which is considered a "prime" to seek a greater increase next year.
Make higher education part of the better future
The train bus went to the Gettysburg College with a loud respiration.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, came out and started for a moment on white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns..
Gracieli's parents were struggling to graduate from high school in El Salvador.
So far Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never got up on the floor of a college.
Now she and the other students in the eight-class group were studying Gettysburg, where the school made $38690 a year, their position was more than alarming visitors of the enthusiasm of potential students.
Yes, that's it! she called Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really?
The Pennsylvania train was one of seven who visited their class trip and were now completely intrigued by the future report: The question is not whether you will join the college.
The question is where.
However, this is a serious problem regarding the high number of children born in the United States of Spanish immigrants who are excluded from high schools or pregnant as an unfavourable person, but there are the statistics of those who receive further education and thus enter high school.
In fact, five of these "soul generation" Spanish students from the college - remarkable results have shown that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central Americans, have arrived in the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers point out, because this undermines their point of way for the generation that played a role in the field of labour force in the country.
Those who have reached high school say that they have a natural tendency to attend school and a natural tendency and effort to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and looked for ways to replace the ignorance of American school.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciele and millions of children who would like to graduate from the train - especially if these efforts persist in time.
If we look at the fact that children come from low-income groups whose parents have no experience and ability to help them guide themselves in the system, any simple intervention at each point does not solve it, says Patricia Gándar, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, where she studied students from Latin America.
We need to think about providing these children with an attractive network of preschoolers in every way they can read high school.
The federal program that financed Graciely's entry by his colleagues is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (appropriate), it provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launch further preparatory programs that start for students from groups with small incomes in high schools and continue until these students graduate from high school.
Since 1999, this programme has served more than 10 million students, of whom more than % have entered colleges, according to the US Ministry of Education data.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry reached agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
In spite of concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to bring important oil companies into the reconstruction of its innocent infrastructure during the two auctions that took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry with foreign oil companies, indicating that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a significant role in the reconstruction of the Iraqi oil industry, protected by decades of war and sanctions.
The US companies were sent with capital participation to just two out of 10 fields.
Seven American companies paid for participation in the second auction, which started on Friday.
Only one has submitted a lost offer.
Two American companies reached an agreement on the field that was held in June.
The limited participation of American oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war, and instead of American companies you have here first on the way to Asia and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, online news.
It'll be a long time before there's anything else for sale in Iraq.
Concerns of security, highlighted by massively coordinated attacks on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the US army's landing, are likely to reflect American companies from a much more intensive company in Iraq, which has manifestly the third largest reserves of raw materials, analysts say.
In some cases, US companies have been in disadvantages, in particular Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobile and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that concluded agreements with the Ministry.
The former American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhilips, who maintained close contacts with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry and offered technical assistance in the past years, left empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts that were awarded at the end of this week.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp. participated in offers on more contracts than all other companies and went with large shares in contracts in two main fields.
We all know that China is trying to become a major economic, as well as technological force, spokesperson for the Assam Jihad oil industry.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be comparable to competition and will be in line with its obligations towards Iraq.
Companies that were previously selected for the submission of tenders which were then compared to the Ministry at the price of bars and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the output above the current level in each field.
The top al-Qaeda planner was probably killed in Pakistan.
At the impact of the US missile at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, it was likely that the peak planner of al-Qaeda operations was killed, as US Anti-Terrorist Department officials announced on Friday.
As confirmed, it could be the second deadly attack on one of the highest leaders of terrorists.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several rockets hit their car on the quarter of the city of Miran Şáh in the province of North Vaziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have alleged that the rockets were fired from the aircraft without a type of crew operating the CIA in a band of illegal indigenous tribes.
These were listed on a white car, which directed to the Afghan border when it was hit, the official, together with a Pakistani cyclist, who called from Miran Šáh.
The official stated that the local armed forces had joined the point and quickly had fun, which was left of "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. anti-terrorist officials quoted an unspecified witness who stated that Somalia was a posi die.
Somalia was designated as a highly established planner for al-Qaeda military operations, which led the operations of terrorist groups outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in the restoration of the world, said a senior official who did not want to be appointed who indicated the sensitive nature of the American air strikes in Pakistan.
If he stood in such a central position, he was likely involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He was given instructions from Al-Qaeda's highest leadership and was planning possible terrorist attacks on the basis of them.
Another U.S. official said that Somalia had acted quickly in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He didn't have to be a popular person for some Americans, but he didn't mean in any way to invite us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second highly established leader of al-Qaeda or Taliban who should be killed since September when Najmudin Jalolov was killed in a similar attack, the leader of the militant group in the ranks of indigenous tribes and three other top populist leaders.
The rate of attacks initiated by the CIA using unmanned aircraft was reduced from the average of about six operations per month to two, according to Long War log records, websites managed by a non-profit group.
The reduction may be justified by the improved tactics of terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also disproportionately killing those suspected of being informants, the site stated.
The United Nations High Representative in Kabul has resigned.
The High Representative of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, stated on Friday that he would like to resign from his post in March and would end such a stormy period of operation, which was threatened by accusations of extensive corruption in the election of the President of Afghanistan, supported by the United Nations.
Eide is leaving because Obama's administration decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN Delegation stated that it was supporting growth, but expressed concern that the US timetable for reducing the state, which starts in 18 months, should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO states to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the construction of Afghan security forces and send the correct signal to the Afghans that they have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment accepted must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civil servants assisting Afghanistan's political change.
The growth on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of the civilians, he said.
Eide said he didn't get back, but he just fulfilled the promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he spent only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the United Nations.
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon now stated he would need time to find a refund.
As I said, it's high time to look after the successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban started looking for a refund.
The officials stated that it was decided between Staffan di Misturou, who had Swedish-Italian origin and had previously led the United Nations mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, France, which had previously led the United Nations peace operation.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September of President Hamid Karzaim, who won the country's presidential elections in masking the presence of massive electoral machines.
Eide rejected this claim, but stated that Galgraith's accusation -- which was released -- "was certainly damaged by the mission, because there was a high degree of cultivation in view of international intervention" at the time of the election.
Eide stated that he proposed a meeting with the highest representative of the citizens for coordinating the relief of the US forces in Afghanistan.
He also ordered the United Nations leadership to allow his successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to lend them to the Afghan mission, because he said he wanted to strengthen their confidence that their money was properly spent.
Eide expressed disappointment at limiting its efforts in Afghanistan and stated that the heavy-duty United Nations charter regulations undermine its ability to use its capabilities.
The rules of the United Nations are that I had the opportunity to get only one person from May, I said.
It's a disaster and I can't keep going.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Defence Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers will soon be "further significant sanctions" on Iran due to a lack of commitment in talks about his nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq during a week's journey through areas where war is being waged in Afghanistan and Iraq, have been luggageizing the prospects of armed actions against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to the military question of probable development.
One of the things that depends on me is whether I've learned something from Iraq in the last six years, [it] is unimaginable unpredictability in the war.
Obama's administration decides on a package of sanctions that could affect the Iranian military and political elite, but Gates has signaled that some of these sanctions could also reach the ordinary Iranians.
He said that "bare of incitement and bans" would require "to make the Iranian government really feel less secure with nuclear weapons", because "their inhabitants will suffer extraordinarily" sanctions.
According to a Friday opinion issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has taken the lead in warning that Iran will have serious consequences unless it leads its nuclear programme to full compliance with the UN Nuclear Safety Committee and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
In its talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he wanted to return to the talks on limiting his nuclear programme and agreed to provide a substantial part of his enriched uranium-rich resource with an exchange of fuel necessary for the reactor to carry out medical research.
The Administrative Board established such an agreement as a way of establishing trust between both parties and in order to obtain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to be derogating from the interim agreements - partly therefore, the expert points out, because Iraqi leadership is divided into opinions on whether to engage in the United States.
Frankly, as regards Iran's stubbornness towards the international community in the case of some of the proposals that he had actually agreed to at the beginning of October, I think it brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese together, on a road that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against Iran, Gates said.
President Obama set a final deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to proposals before returning to search for other elections, including monitoring, which foreign ministers will call Hillary Rodham Clinton once called 'degrading sanctions'.
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations on Thursday condemned what it called "unreasonable and unsubstantiated charges" in front of some members of the Security Committee on Iranian nuclear activities and stated that it wanted to continue in talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before he left for Kurdistan, rich in oil, to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish representatives in Irbil.
It is enduring a high tension between Kurda and the Iraqi Arab majority, especially due to borders, ownership rights and income distribution.
Gtes insisted on both sides to reduce the potential for conflicts to prevent US plans from being held back to limit the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to address Kurdish anxiety from persistent depression. US official places quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzaaní, President of the Kurdish regional government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in the united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In Old China, Change in Course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters, on which they read that "The Earth's Mother is too exhausted to enjoy more children" and "One child also means one more grave".
Then they learned that when the official government positions in Shanghai, alarmed by low births and ageing populations in their city, suddenly changed the course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their reaction was immediate and determined: Never.
We always spent all our time and energy just one child.
We left nothing for the other, says Wang, 31 years old, human resources manager who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years of China's lasting policy of having only one child was introduced and creating only two generations of notorically chubby and gypsy children, affected by "small emperors", the country threatens the population crisis.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple compared to six before the policy entered into force, according to the United Nations data.
The distribution of the population, where the number of people aged 60 years and above is predicted to rise sharply from 16.7 per cent in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This is far above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
Inequality is greater in rich coastal cities with populations with higher education, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, 60 - year - olds and older made nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission for Population and Family Planning, said many couples must have children to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and reduce the number of working forces in the future".
He says it's about "to be old, it doesn't mean to be rich -- like in developed countries, like Japan or Sweden."
Slowing up
As was introduced into the country's constitution in 1978, the Chinese policy of one child is probably the most controversial mandate of the Communist Party.
The two who violated the policy were subjected to immeasurable torments -- up to their three-year payment in some areas -- and discrimination in work.
China's official offices have been prosecuting policies that have helped the country to prevent critical waste of natural resources, while human rights defenders have been condemned in the promotion of politics.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women to undergo abortions during the second child.
In addition, many two had to undergo sexist election losses, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, population officials have been progressively smaller in their opinion on the policy of one child.
In 2004, the number of exceptions - including city residents, members of national minorities, and cases where men and women were single - were generally increased in 2004, and in 2007 the dikes of their hives, causing a hard line.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor of population research at Beijing University, said that central government officials had already debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner was a single.
In June Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Nearly overnight, the posters urging parents to have only one child replaced by copies of the regulation, describing in detail how the second child would be allowed to have and how to apply for permission.
The city administration sent officials to plan for families and volunteers to meet with couples in their homes and put the planes under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice for those who decided to have more than one child.
The response was cold, the family planning officials were introduced.
Aggravating response
Although officials in one rural town around Shanghai recorded an increase in interest in two who would like to have a second child after the campaign began, most urban districts did not report changes.
Huinan city district with a population of 115,000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Disillusioned officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of people born in the city in 2010 is still expected only around 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Family Planning Committee in the Shanghai branch of Caol, stated that financial considerations were probably the main reason people don't want to have more children.
They want to give the best of the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said she would like two children and they were legally allowed to do so.
But as many Chinese who have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a duty grid, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge one child's policy as a controversial legal issue, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is in the seventh month of pregnancy in relation to the first child.
Yes, we were delighted to have more than one child.
But the only problem is politics.
It's about money.
Other couples point to psychological reasons for weight gain.
Wang, the manager of human resources, says they only have one child, because she was also the only one: "We were the center of attention of our families and all cared for us.
We were not used to providing care, and we actually didn't want to take care of the other.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who was a member of the U.S. translation company, said that much less.
For the two-carrier parents in the middle class who had reduced the birth rate, he said to be successful means to be selfish.
Today, 20 and 30 years of age, adults look at their parents as the first days of the Czech experiment with capitalism and do not want this way of life for themselves, he says.
Just one child makes enormous demands on parents' time, he says.
The mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are still controversial questions to the proponent -- "You have to stop your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You have to have a summary prepared at the time when the child is 9 months for a good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to meet one child, says Che, but not two.
We're the first generation with higher living standards, he says.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
The United Nations Group set up a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by a long-standing undisclosed attitude and mutual association -- again focused on the release of a document on Friday, which proposes ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 40 years with industrialised nations, with the most of the burden in the near future.
The text, which can provide a starting point for the final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as the way forward.
But there was significant progress in the negotiations that took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Kodana next week.
Created by the United Nations ad hoc working group, this text unmistakably indicates how much money rich countries should provide to those poor people to deal with global warming in the short term and in the long term.
And it provides a whole range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies so that they can limit their carbon output and what the upper limit of global temperature should be, which political actors will still be able to tolerate.
It delivers a process of great flexibility, says John Coequitt, the top representative of the Washington Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six-page document, deleted from 180 pages of the text from the discussion to focus on what the top climate officer at the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, described as "a big picture".
It outlines the possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly limit their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent per year compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries could reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent during this period.
Together, the country would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union welcomed Friday's pledge to provide $3.6 billion over the next three years in order to help poorer countries adapt to climate change -- from flood management and drought to depleting.
However, on Friday, he introduced a kind of verbal fire extinguisher that he considered during the last week’s talks.
The United States Special Envoy for Climate Issues Todd Stern rejected a speech requiring binding restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries compared to voluntaryity in the major developing economies, unless they were financed by the developed world.
The Posun signaled that Obama's administration had made a harder line towards China without Bush's administrative officials just two years ago.
The United States will not enter into a contract without the translation of the major developing countries and the implementation of actions, Stern said, who also claimed that the text was not sufficient to ensure restrictions and should be verified by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei informed the US chief climate negotiator that either the lack of "silence" or "unreliance" had led to a week earlier a communication that the United States would not help China financially in order to cope with global warming.
With the future of the economic course of the major world powers at stake, the Tahanics both in the developing world and between the industrial world and the emerging economies.
The current fight is carried out by the majority of individual economies rather than by the maintenance of the planet, between China and the United States, as regards the fulfilment of their respective commitments, while poorer nations point out that two tenths of the world's most influential countries ignore the scientific imperative to carry out the most important actions.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it is not surprising that the main powers are fighting about who should bear the costs of limiting greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive when looking for a way to prevent large emitters responsible for their actions.
It is a clear game of the development of new economic hegemony, Ulate, who also serves as regional adviser to regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international nature protection.
Some of the countries that are most vulnerable to climate change have indicated that they would like to continue to pursue a legally binding agreement in Kodana, though most of the main participants, said that the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, created a 24-page proposal for an agreement last Friday morning.
Arthur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate negotiations for the benefit of the European Commission, said that prosecuting small island nations "has caused political pressure on the entire polar process" partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging economies, such as China and India.
The action sparked new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining controversial issues before the heads of the government were fighting for the agreement.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, stepped out of the aircraft and ran the halls of the centre of Bell to a closed door meeting and new conferences, so they could drop the demands that will be assessed next week.
The total scope of the assembly - when 13,000 people were moved from and to the convention center each day, the guitar players who played at night staged ironingly watching the countries they thought had been sent out, and there was a hand-to-hand transmission of proposals to paper rather than electronic mail -- a challenge.
The intensity is only a superstructure: almost all key ministers were present in Kodana and earlier in the mid-60s.
We got into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the Deputy Minister of Global Policy for International Nature Protection.
Heavy weights are coming.
British first train at 140 miles an hour pre-defined this Monday's feeling
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, the witch crossed the darkness on the sign of leaving the train, which meant a revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford in Kent to London's St Pancras and will exceed 58 miles per 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and went to the first high-speed personal assembly outside London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain with the international networks of fast, reliable trains and connect the huge agglomerations of Midland, North and Scotland with London.
Marked standing water should be reduced in passenger transport and on commercial routes and the transition from aircraft and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate road congestion.
In theory, the three main political parties were allowed to obtain this vision.
But tens of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable fight for projects and concerns about environmental damage has now accelerated the construction of British high-speed rails.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, transmitted its message to Lord Adonis on December 30, as the Times said.
It provided him with a detailed map of the route of another planned stage of high-speed network.
The new route of London's connection with Western Midland was designed to be within five metres in urban areas and quarters, where access to life centers could be problematic.
In the open area, the final route was planned up to 25 m.
HS2 also expects to determine three options for the extensive high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will respond to the spring.
The preferred option is to confirm the form of the Y letter, when one high-speed line should lead to Western Midland.
The trail should be shared near Birmingham with one branch, passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One line should lead to Scotland.
"It seems like the most effective choice has been made," said the railway expert.
Once it's done, the driving time between London and Edinburgh will be two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be opened before 2025, could allow the traveler to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in attendance.
Proposals should allow trains to drive 2250 miles per hour, which would make it the fastest out of the British network in Europe.
The initial track is already designed to take trains 400 m long, which would be able to transport 1100 people.
Up to 18 compounds could operate every hour on London - Birmingham.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers in an hour if needed.
In view of the capital restriction, it is assumed that existing stations would expand to include a high-speed network.
Railway industry experts claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not go ahead with the general elections.
Even if he puts the car in motion, the network should be built on the parts.
Trains should first be put into service, not on high-speed routes, but on existing routes north of Birmingham and keep travel times between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is considered a decisive starting point for ensuring the transition from aircraft to trains, a reference point for the railway revolution.
Tax payers paid a mortgage of 75,000 pounds on Tory's orange
Alan Duncan, the holder of the Tory’s front seats in the MP’s library, paid taxpayers thousands of pounds last year for the orange he built in his house in the electoral district.
Talking parties to the prison, which was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the MPs lived "by gifts", increased his mortgage to 75,000 pounds to build a deep-covered expansion in his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to account for special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month for taxpayers.
The public authorities approved the claims on time and thus were not consulted by Sir Thomasen Legge, who carried out the control of the Member States' expenditures. Last night Mr. Duncan expressed his demands "it might have been cleaner or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns two two-storey houses for everyone in his electoral district, Rutland and Melton.
Houses have a value of about a million pounds.
There is a kitchen, living room and dining room on the ground, but the financial office has agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added to the winter garden house, which is marked in the plans as "orangerie".
Neighbors describe it as "a glass of fun and hospitality."
Mr Duncan was not asked to provide some explanation for the increased loan during the last check by the General Standards and Privilege Committee in the last mortgage settlement.
The committee informed him last month that he had violated the rules after reviewing his expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed his pension security at a mortgage of 271406 pounds from his property in London to a house in his polling district, which he bought in 1991, year before becoming a member of the parliament.
The documents released this week showed that Mr. Duncan claimed about 1,400 pounds a month in the interest of the mortgage until March of last year.
In April, his claims increased to over 1,800 pounds a month.
The interest in RBS mortgages by Mr Duncan could not change at this time, which indicates that all of this was intended to finance a loan of 75000 pounds.
The standard variable RBS mortgage payment decreased from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, where it remained.
The last document by the general authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to claim 1250 pounds a month in May.
Mr. Duncan left his job as shadow leader of the House in September after a secret reporter filmed it and said that the MPs had to survive the expense scandal.
"In principle, it's national, you have to live for a gift, and it treats you like s**t."
He said: I have lost money for my garden, and my money, and my debt, and my little portion of what I needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't do it."
The envoy, a millionaire of the former career as an oil merchant, was first called upon to explain his release in May, when it turned out that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, even before the approval of the financial authority, that it could be "considered excessive".
One of the activists dug up a pit in the form of a librarian in Mr. Duncan's lawn for a protest after it was discovered that he had claimed 4,000 pounds for three years.
When asked last night to increase the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said, "It was because of an increase in capital, which was approved by both the financial authority and then by law."
He added: "It is not a question of hiding and clicking or breaking rules or anything else.
It's absolutely equal to the line down, according to the rules, and that's all.
This could not be much more clean or simpler in other ways."
Come on, everyone, take a close look at the chat on the Brighton coast with the Advent Calendar.
Coastal chats in Brighton found new meaning of life in the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that stimulates the management of creativity has called on 24 owners to earn their chats for every day in December and to use Christmas collections as the theme of this auction.
The event began on 1 December, when it allowed visitors to watch the last chat from 17.30 to 18.30 each day, and the Bishop bread and fried wine provided free of charge.
The selected colleges included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, when the chat represented the work of Janet Tozer, the local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, an assistant to television marketing from Hove, is a priest without a scholarship in the chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion much more important for people in post-Christian society.
"Why do we as a church expect people to come to a foreign old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in a stirring way.
"The idea of an advent calendar in chats was just created as a conversation with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and pulsating place and we have tried to try and present it in a spiritual way."
Strong mobilization in Kodana and in the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people went to the streets on Saturday, demanding an important and binding agreement to fight global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Kodana, and demonstrated throughout the world where hundreds of people were arrested by the police on that occasion.
At least 30 thousand people, according to police sources, and one hundred thousand according to organizers, were in the cold weather in the Danish capital at the occasion of the UN climate conference, which aims to adopt a Friday agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, said that increasing global mobilization, with clear evidence of the current manifestations, contributed to the "political tax" of any failure in Kodana would be too high.
According to the AFP newspaper, incidents in the capital of Denmark occurred shortly after the beginning of the race, when the group of approximately 300 demonstrators dressed in black began to break out the exhibits with parachute cubes and cages.
The police immediately hit hard.
Overall, the police announced the arrest of between 600 and 700 people and clarified that it was particularly the members of "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical independent groups, which had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
Koalice Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the action, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "without distinction" and stressed that about a hundred of them were in the streets and in the seat "remained in the streets on Saturday night" and even through extreme winter.
Following Parliament's abandonment, the solution in peace was directed towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate inside.
For speakers, a podium was built, before which a spiritual meeting was held at the candles for the participation of the former South African Archbishop of the Cape Town of Desmond Tutu.
Most Protestants arrived by bus and train from large European cities and besides Africans, there were also a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people dressed mostly in blue cloaks were created in the morning hours of the first assembly in Kodana and at the call of the Friends of the Earth group, who wanted to create "blue waves" for "just climate".
Today we go to the streets to demand the settlement of environmental debt in favour of the south, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine warrior from the Jubilee South Coalition in Kodani.
We can't say anymore: it's time for this to be announced by the beninic singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa rivers and rivers dry, we can walk in them today and it has never been possible before.
For the first time in history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 following the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the movement of the fight against other worlds has approached environmental organisations.
French European Ambassador José Bové, one of the characters of the struggle for another world, said that he came to Kodana with the aim of "combining climate and social justice". "At present there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands especially sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, there were about 50,000 people in the street according to organizers.
There were several hundred people in Manila, mostly students, in red clothes and with jackets that evoked the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred demonstrators went to the street demanding a major action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseilles (them), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyons (outside), participated in protests organized by "350".
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia chose her president, Georgia condemns it as a "frahku"
Abkhazia chose her president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent in Georgia, Tbilisi declared this step "frahka".
About 131000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 on control of the South Ossetia, which is another former Georgian territory recognised by Russia.
The election rooms closed in 17h GMT.
According to the officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission, the participation was 58% a few hours before the closing of the election rooms.
The first preliminary results should be announced on Saturday night on Sunday.
All five candidates, including President-in-Office Sergei Bagapš, categorically reject the idea of joining Georgia, which condemned these elections.
These choices are a freckle.
On the other hand, Georgian President Michail Saakashvili "is sorry that Abkhazia has fallen completely into Russian rule," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, the independence of this territory was recognised by 216.000 inhabitants only of Nicaragua and Venezuela, while the rest of the world considered it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by the Russian forces.
After the division from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict, where several thousand people were killed, Abkhazia is trying to show through the elections that she is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, said the AFP Kvarčija Svetlanová, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted to voting for President Bagapše.
She was one of those who came to the poll room at school in the capital of Suchuma, to a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The question of Russian sovereignty is the main theme of the presidential elections in this region on the Black Sea, which can be proud of its beautiful nature.
After all this small country with 216,000 inhabitants, a huge billboard with Bagapš is located alongside Russian President Dmitrija Medvedeva and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gala, west of the country, the Russian officials who came to watch the election during a reasonable period of time were awaiting a warm reception by the periodic archival of Beslan Aršby.
"We, Abchaz, are grateful" said at a small ceremony, having in mind the support of Moscow and, in particular, its decision to recognise the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian Parliament and added glass vodka to it.
The opposition, which was represented in the elections by former Vice-President Raul Khadzimbou and two merchants Zaus Ardzinbou and Beslan Boutbow, criticised contracts concluded last year with Moscow, such as an agreement that enables Russia to control the Abkhazie rail network for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support the current government or opposition.
The upper half of the majority is required to win the election by 50% plus one vote.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decision-making struggle shall take place within two weeks.
Climate: World events, events in Kodana
Tens of thousands of people went to the streets on Saturday, demanding an important and binding agreement to fight global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Kodana, and demonstrated worldwide where about 700 people were arrested by the police on that occasion.
At least 30 thousand people, according to police sources, and hundreds of thousands according to organizers, were showing in the cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts up to December 18 delegates from 193 countries, acting on an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Following Parliament's abandonment, the solution in peace was directed towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate inside.
For speakers, a podium was built, before which a spiritual meeting was held at the candles for the participation of the former South African Archbishop of the Cape Town of Desmond Tutu.
According to the AFP newspaper, incidents occurred shortly after the departure of the pipeline, when a group of several hundred demonstrators dressed in black and armed bricks and shields began to break down the exhibits.
The police immediately surrounded them and struck them without waiting, and several demonstrators hit the ground.
Overall, the police announced the arrest of between 600 and 700 people and clarified that it was particularly the members of the Blacks Blocks, ultra-radical independent groups, which had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, Eastern France.
Later in the afternoon, one police officer was injured and four cars were burned near a squad near incidents that resulted from police sources of detention of about 20 people.
We're focusing on extremist groups, he warned the speaker police Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters flew back into the air.
Most of the protestors who arrived by bus or train from large German cities from London, Amsterdam and Milan were of European origin.
But there were also many Asians, including several Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people dressed mostly in blue cloaks were created in the morning hours in Kodana the first meeting on the call of the Friends of the Earth group, who wanted to create "blue waves" for "just climate".
Today we go to the streets to demand the settlement of environmental debt in favour of the south, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine warrior from the Jubilee South Coalition in Kodani.

French European Ambassador José Bové, one of the characters of the struggle for another world, said that he came to Kodana with the aim of "combining climate and social justice". "At present there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
Oxfam has invited several well-known personalities, such as the Danish model Helen Christensen or the former United Nations Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands especially sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, there were about 50,000 people in the street according to organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students in red clothes, and with suits that evoked the importance of solar energy, were present in front of the Philippine city council.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, several hundred demonstrators also met with the requirement of an important action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseilles (them), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyons (outside), participated in protests organized by "350".
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
The subjects of the geography and the script will be strengthened in the framework of the reform of the general gymnasium, Chatel said.
School Minister Luc Chatel stated on Sunday during a discussion for the JDD magazine that the articles of the journal and the geography will be "strengthened" in the framework of the reforms of the general gymnasiums, although their education will no longer be mandatory in the last year of the gymnasium with a focus on accurate sciences.
Now all second-year-old students will have four hours a week and will also have the same program from a general culture, Chatel confirmed.
According to the Minister, "it is necessary to end up with discipline", because according to him, specialization S is no longer focused on accurate science" but "in essence there are the best students in it".
The specializations of the EC and L cannot be with any sub-specialisations, it continues and emphasizes: "I have heard many historians and intellectuals who would complain that in the last year of the professional universities there is no geography and a history."
A study by the agency Ifop, which published the Humanité Journal on Saturday, showed that seven French out of ten (69%) did not agree with the government's project to abolish the compulsory teaching of inscription and geography in the graduation year with specialization S, and therefore many intellectuals and teachers criticised both the left and some Members of the right.
On the contrary, the Minister added that "not in mind" to abolish philosophy in the specialization programme S of the senior year.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended reform in the education of teachers, while 16 organizations (students and committees) called for participation in the Tuesday mobilization against this project, which they considered to offer educational education to future professors of gymnasiums.
In the course of the Master's Study 2 (M2), the Minister explained at the beginning of the annual acceptance test based on their field and at the end of the year the additional test verifying their ability to teach.
The participants will participate in the training courses during the second year of the Master's degree and the first year before the students will perform as a professor-intestinal.
If you count all the courses that will be offered to you before the reception, you will get more experience with the pupils, almost 300 hours, continued .
The Minister also announced that he would propose "personal right to education", which so far does not exist in national education.
He confirmed the project to cancel the school map by 2012.
At the elite University of École, normal superiors have 15 minutes to convince them of the climate.
Fifteen minutes to introduce the goals of the Kodán Summit: this is the challenge announced in the Chamber in the morning by Jean Jouzel, a multi-president of the International Climate Development Expert Group (GIEC) to encourage the Ecole Normal Superiority University on Ulm Street.
According to one AFP journalist, Nobel laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the Ernest conference, which is a one-day seminar composed of fifteen-minute contributions from experts to be made and opened to the public.
We wanted to do something that attracted people and based on what they would like to learn more, explained at the 22-year-old Edward Hanneso conference, one of the organizers of this seminar, which was named according to the local lake fish named by the students.
It is estimated that 20 contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines are selected and clarified that the selection is based on their charisma.
About warming the climate "we can talk for hours, but we can also cut down the basic targets in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke before fifty listeners without pre-prepared notes, only using graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed with the hope that listeners will know that "codany conference is based on a very serious scientific basis".
The videos on these lectures will be posted on the school's website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" seminar is scheduled for February, and the next will follow with regularity every two months.
Delay in payments: anger in prisons, planned measures
The committees of the prison guards announced "general mobilization" on Friday, as they demand that they be paid the premium and the time-limits for which the award was postponed for financial reasons.
Prisoners' FO (2nd Supervisory Committees) asked employees who would not have the service to participate in demonstrations held in the morning before the prison facilities and to "block them" and thus to alert them to "the theft of their wages".
The CGT for Prison Supervisors (the third committees of this sector) has called for "to call for meetings in individual prisons and to start basic mobilization" by "suddenly and unacceptable", so that "times and allowances for work at night, on Sundays and on holidays" worked in October are not paid in December.
First Committees of Overseers, the Federal Union of Prison Overseers (Ufap/Unsa), "proclaims for total mobilization (...) with the aim of showing dissatisfaction and dissatisfaction".
The Executive Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtime has increased significantly in 2009 and that not all have been included in the financial budget, but ensures that the amounts due will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Office stated that Michèle Alliot-Mariová sent a communication to the committees of the prison supervisors to ensure that the payment was made next month.
I know of the efforts made by the prison staff to ensure the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, writes the ministry in its communication.
I have ordered the managing director of the prison to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation, which has arisen with a poor assessment of the number of times, has never been repeated in the future, has added to the Ministry of Alliot-Mari.
Prosinc's salary will therefore be low, with the exception of management workers who receive a famous award for performance and achievement of their goals, will indicate Ufap/Unsa, and for you "there will always be a place in the budget".
It's just a scandal, the interregional FO Union in Marseille has been exonerated and announced its decision to boycott to revoke "all meetings and pre-calls".
Employees will not come to work on Sundays or on holidays unless their allowance for these October days will be paid in December, as well as in the meantime, FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne is also in danger.
At a time when we are getting more work and more jobs without providing us with additional staff, it is sad to allow them to pay the lowest level of staff, says CGT prison supervisors in Bordeaux.
According to the Committees, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are better than others.
However, in each case of financial resources because little, the Secretary-General of Ufap, Jean-François Forget, noted.
Obama says he's giving "better gifts" to Christmas than he's getting
American President Barack Obama, who prepares for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, committed "bohyni" to Oprah Winfrey's screens, that as far as gifts are concerned, he has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than those I get."
The president and his wife, Michelle, spoke in a special edition of the series, which will be broadcast on Sunday evening at the ABC station about how they are going to celebrate Christmas and the end of the year in their new and prestigious homes.
Even Bo, a small four-year-old family partner will get his reward.
Jesus also likes Boa, said Michelle Obama by saying that the dog will also get a gift "of course" as it comes from the levels of the pre-sending order.
And Michelle Obama also defended herself against her husband's claim on the quality of the gifts she received: "No, I gave you the first gifts last year," the president was offended.
Well, of course it's true, he was forced to agree to the president, but immediately with a sense of humor, he showed his finger to the first lady's pearl necklace: "And who gave you this?"
In this one-hourly very relaxed series with the famous moderator who strongly supported Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, Obama’s husbands also talked about their favorite gifts that they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a cycle with a ten-degree transfer, but also a basketball ball, which dedicated him to his father’s Christmas, who met only very rarely.
I remember seeing my father coming to see us on Christmas and giving me that basketball ball, the president told me.
A long time ago, I realized that the ball actually gave it to me.
The first lady remembered the doll house again.
I didn't know how to organize everything in the house, and so I fixed all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the roof, but the little house I loved for the ladies, Michelle Obama remembered.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL indicates he's in artificial sleep
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles for the reason of the "hungry" caused by the larger operation he performed in France, but the situation is according to his closest "under control", while the station of RTL indicated that the singer is in an artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
The 66th-year-old rocker was again operated from Wednesday night to Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, after American doctors found "an injury arising from the operation" a heated plate, which he sold in Paris on November 26, informed his press department in Paris that these lay required "correction".
However, the press section of the singer tried to calm the public and stated that the situation was "under control" and at the same time announced that a new medical communication would be issued within 48 hours.
According to the RTL station, which is the main partner of the last tour singer, Johnny Hallyday was placed in an artificial sleep to prevent "sickness and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens our eyes, we'll have a little more security, he adds RTL.
The press department did not confirm or comment on this information on the AFP question.
RTL also states that, according to "some sources", no wood was placed after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated at the international clinic Parc Monceau because of a hot spot.
The surgery, which was planned several days ago, was performed by neurosurgery Stephan Delajoux, a well-known doctor in artistic circles.
However, your doctor was not available on Thursday to express himself to RTL.
After this operation, the singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for the infection that occurred after the attack.
The singer Eddie Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday's, said on Thursday on the radio of RTL that his friend was just going through "bad period", but added that he was a rocker "unworked care", because it's a big "fighter".
He called me right before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was making a fool, because spending 12 hours on a plane after such an operation is no fun, said Eddie Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, he calmed down the situation of the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, who stated that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well on antibiotics", and that the infection was "stopped".
Mr. Camus also said that he met with Laeticia, a wife singer, and that he didn't notice any special concerns.
The health problems of the singer only resonate since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to the surprise of all, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday was operated on a "small tumor of thin intestines" and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which was presented as his farewell.
But since then, each of his health problems has been very monitored and commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty in moving on the scene.
In mid-November, his team again had to decompose the news of new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: Prime Minister Bousquet in his favorite discipline
Frances Frédérick Bousquet, a three-dimensional medalist at the 2009 World Championship in a large swimming pool, won a title at the 2009 European Championship in a small swimming pool in Istanbul, which he especially likes: 50m free way.
The first day of the championship, on which the combinations are finally allowed, only three world records fell, although they were expected to be much more.
One of them won the Hungarian race Evelyn Verrasztová at 200 m local race and two remaining Russian male staff at 4x50 m local race.
A great pity for Bousqueta, who had made a glimpse of the world record in a 50 m free way, which is already a holder in a large pool (20,94).
In one of the two royal disciplines of swimming, 50m free way, the 28-year-old French won the final 20.53 seconds in the finals at which the prime minister launched ten sailors instead of the ordinary eights.
Bousquet defeated Croatia's Duje Draganja (20,70) and Russia's Sergei Fesikova (20,84), but failed to overcome the world record (20,30), as expected.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if there's a world record in my reach, I'll try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers had combinations made of polyurethane, which will be prohibited from 1 January.
The combinations have helped from February 2008 to 238 world records and their era ends in Istanbul, which is the first host in 1999 to compete in the same.
The use of the combination this time did not help even the Germans Paul Biedermann, a double world champion in a large swimming pool in Rome, who had a world record of reach.
The young swimmer failed to win a record that holds 400 meters free (3:32.77), but won the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), in front of the Russian racer Nikit Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything in the race.
I knew I wasn't going through the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent to the future, explained by Biedermann.
USA: Romanian sarcophagus board owned by Zolovi was issued $1.5 million
The board of the Roman sarcophagus, which was not owned by any other than the French writer Emil Zolova, was issued on Thursday for 1.5 million US dollars, which is significantly more than was estimated, said a merchant with Sotheby ́s art.
The price of these two meters long and 63 cm high front boards, from the third century of our airport, was estimated to be between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
Marble "representing four dionysus scenes in the elaborate architectural decoration, surrounded by satires and bakchanty is a rare work, similar pieces are very little, perhaps four or five in the world," announced AFP on Tuesday Florent Heintz, Vice-President of the auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby's.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still going on, but it's the object that was probably the most, told the agency of the AFP spokesperson Sotheby's, Dan Aberneth.
That Emile Zola ordered this marble was found a few days ago.
The board was almost 300 years old in Rome in a famous collection of the Borgi family and then appeared gradually with the French actress Cecile Sorel, who made her a bath at his private hotel in Paris and Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Third Republic of France, and briefly with the President of the Council before joining the power of Petina.
She's been stuck there for about 50 years.
Florent Heintz discovered during the search of the museum database in Louvre that this board was part of the "residues of Emil Zoly" opened in 1903, a year after the death of author "Therese Raquin" and fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
A interrupted attempt to get President Zelay from Honduras to Mexico.
Mexico concluded on Thursday that the conditions for the transport of the President-in-Office of Honduras, Manuel Zelayi, who the rebels refused to provide a guarantee of safe departure were not met.
After the telephone conversation I had last night with President Zelay, everything for the time being shows that there is no way to achieve this transport, the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinos, has introduced.
The Mexican government aircraft, which flew back to Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelay, introduced the source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
The cleaning government wanted to bring President Zelay to the "demise" and to ask for political asylum abroad, just so that it would provide him with a safe exit.
But the rejected president rejected these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as an exile head of state.
The government of the cleaners "have experienced further failures when I wanted to give up my function (...), they wanted me to give up the demise," said Zelaya Radio Globe on Thursday, in which he often expressed himself to the political crisis that has lasted in this Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I've got my guitar here, I've added the President-in-Office, hidden at the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months, and he's been playing some chords.
Mexico has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transport, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, the Minister of the Interior of the Clean Government said on Wednesday, Oscar Raul Matute, HRN's Honduran radio.
I will not ask for asylum from any country, said Manuel Zelaya in the interview for the Telesur station, which has its seat in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I'll leave as President of the Hondurasn people, he's stressed.
The news of Zelay's departure was mobilized in the middle of the president's palace, who came to gather around the embassy of Brazil, where the army strengthened its defense.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the position of the Puritan government.
They're showing their marginal attitude to international standards, added.
Zelaya, who approached the Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, was dismissed on 28 June, on the day he organised a public consultation in preparation for his re-election, and against the recommendation of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
From exile in Costa Rica, he unexpectedly returned on 21 February and found refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he gets out of here, he'll be arrested and held responsible for the crime of "vesselrady" from which he's accused, the state of the plenipotentiary.
On 29 November, Puritan President Roberto Micheletti was able to organise presidential elections to replace President Zelayi.
In the controversial elections recognised by the United States but condemned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelay's return to power until the end of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street wakes up, U.S. trade balance promotes optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday with a rise and the results of the US trade balance testify to the rise both in the United States and in its partners: Dow Jones earned 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to data from the final conclusion, Dow Jones Industrial Average has improved from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance from 7,13 points to 2190.06 points.
Index Standard & Poor 500 has improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news from different parts of the economy, Lindsey Piegzová from FTN Financial commented.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market focuses on "half a full glass."
For Peter Cardillo from Avalon Partners, investors focus mainly on US trade balance numbers, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The balance of trade in the United States fell by 7.6% in October to $32.9 billion.
The analysts were expecting an increase in the garbage.
There was an increase in both imports and exports.
A big news is the growing volume of trade, in particular exports of goods, which reflects the growth of the major trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell from the research company Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week, unemployment rose against all expectations and the number of job-seekers reached 474,000.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new entrants has dropped "at the lowest in this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The paper market has also dropped.
The 10-year-old stock surplus increased to 3,482% on Tuesday night and the profit of 30 increased to 4,492% on 4,408% the day before.
Cuba : hundreds of supporters of the regime wrote "Dams in White"
A number of hundreds of Cuban regime officials wrote out on Thursday the wives of political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of World Day of Human Rights and prevented further demonstrations involving dozens of dissidents.
About forty "Dam in White", a wife or close political prisoners were posted directly on the street of Raula Castra's stand-ins during their march towards the center of the city with a requirement for the release of political prisoners, the journalist informed.
Away with Yankees!, "Golden!", "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!", "Let Fidel and Raul live!" were scandalized by the high-strength of the regime's dissidents.
The dissidents were finally escorted by civilian personnel who came "safety".
The day before, there was a similar demonstration against "Dams in White" in Havana, but there was no injury or arrest.
However, in the Havana district of Vedado, police officers were detained in a civilian camp of about ten dissidents, who were also going to protest on Thursday on the occasion of the World Day of Human Rights, AFP reported.
According to this newspaper, police have imposed dissidents that have been drafted by government officials into civilian vehicles for the use of force.
The arrest of dissidents under similar conditions takes only a few hours.
The holders of the 2005 European Parliament's Sacharov Prize, "The White Ladies" organised an unauthorized march for "the release of all, according to the disentent, about 200 political prisoners", introduced one of their leaders, Laura Pollanová, whose husband Héctor Maceda was sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Mr. Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 are still on the grid.
The Cuban authorities consider the defendants to be "boilers" or "agents" paid by their criminal enemy, the United States.
A complete miracle, Cuban television reported a Thursday demonstration of government regime supporters against the "revolution opponents".
Cuba, with the Communist Party in the head and the government's policy, is regularly accused of non-compliance with human rights and freedoms by European or American NGOs, including freedom of speech.
He killed an 80-year-old man with a knife and wounded five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A prostitute armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five other people in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at the peak on Thursday afternoon.
According to the preliminary findings of the investigation, the attacker at the age of 28 reportedly attacked two knives and for unknown reasons of the 80-year-old in or before the doctor, 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is a version of the police and witnesses.
The heavily wounded old gentleman, born in 1929, died according to the Alliance police union in the hospital for the consequences of the injury.
In this medicine or before it, the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
A husband in his 30 ’ s began to defend himself and was wounded.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where an 80-year-old man died.
The life of the second injured is in danger, according to police sources, they are likely to have been hit by vital organs.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was transferred to the hospital "in shock," the police source said.
An armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as the police source said, then ran into the street, still on the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He injured two more, apparently by accident: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old man, the other seriously.
It's not quite clear how it all worked out, because it all happened in the evening.
He was armed with two cutting knives, carrying a cross behind his back, said at the location of the Alliance's leading union in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several gangsters, including young people, tried to stop and arm themselves, according to the testimony of the assembled AFP.
I saw a 30-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commenting on Alberto's situation, a clerk from a nearby bar.
He threw himself into a crowd, including one of the city policemen, who broke his wrists.
Still at Boulevard Jean-Jares, at level 61, two police cities, including their commanders, tried to detain a armed man and were wounded by the fists, the police source said.
The incident occurred in one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
The coroner came to tell me there's an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a seven-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and I noticed a big chest wound, told the agent AFP Frederic Allion, a 30-five-year-old doctor.
About five minutes later, a second person came, who also had stabbing wounds with a knife.
A man who didn't have any IDs arrested after the state police.
The State Representative in Nanterre handed over the case to the District Police Department in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspect was transferred to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody waiting for an inquiry.
The police source didn't exclude his location in a psychiatric treatment.
Another police source stated that six police officers were needed to control him at a police station in Clicha, where he was transferred.
He was "all beyond himself" as "all the crazys of this kind, whose power in action increases ten times."
USA: Polish lawyer again requests termination of criminal prosecution
The lawyer of the Polish-French director Romana Polanski again requested on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, the West of the United States) to stop a criminal offense against his client, currently in his Swiss residence due to the ant affair that occurred thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, the legal representative of the film director "Pianist" criticised three judges of the appeal court of the second period in California, a serious mistake that occurred when the trial was remanded in 1977.
I'm calling for a suspension of the complaint now and now, lawyer Hummel introduced and added that from the behavior of the judge who then decided in the case, Laurence Rittenband "had a cold in his back."
According to him, the judge (who had already died) was supposed to act with a state representative who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison – which is a serious violation of the law.
Information on this interview was found in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and wanted" (Roman Polanski, sought and requested), from the mouth of the State Representative David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally declared at the end of September that he lied to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, Judge Hummel will require a court hearing in which he can provide evidence of his claim.
The complainant repeated what had already been said in the first state, because no serious examination of the application for suspension of criminal proceedings would occur until Roman Polanski was brought before the court.
The 76th year director fled the United States in 1978, before the court ruled on "unlawful sexual contact" with an unaccompanied girl at the age of 13.
Ever since then, he has never returned to the United States.
The deputy prosecutor in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said Roman Polanski "should be there to attend the retrial."
In this case, we want to show not only the Roman of Poland, but also the other accused that it is possible to escape?
It is the opinion that the director "requests favor in court and at the same time honors his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to make a decision, also stressed that "there are other alternatives to escape".
Lawyer Hummel wasn't himself who asked to stop Roman Polanski's criminal investigation.
The victim's legal representative, Samantha Geimer, also again requested the termination of the criminal investigation.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear the everlasting burden every time the Polish case was brought out and added: "No one in this room can say that the process was just".
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 February in Switzerland on the order of the United States
After more than two months behind the grid, he was released to the domestic prison in his chaplain in Gstaad, where he waited for a possible demonstration.
Wall Street ends in no direction, he's braked by the rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without direction, the market disappears between indicators that are better than expected in the United States and the rising dollar price: Dow Jones received +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to data from the final conclusion, Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved from 65.67 points to 10,471,50 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance has left 0.55 points and ended at 2.190,31 points.
Index Standard & Poor's 500 increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Frankly, the market is very quiet, Mace Blackxilver from Marblehead Asset Management introduced.
It's still in a tight range, the volume of the trade has been very low, and I think it'll stay until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected, and which " helped improve the market's mood with regard to the stability of economic recovery," said analyst Charles Schwab.
In the United States, the retail market grew by 1.3% in November, the second month after itself and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index, the trust of American consumers also returned and grew to 73,4 against 67,4 in December last month.
However, the indices have been speeded up by a new increase in the dollar price of the euro, which is highest in the last two months, which "presses down the sector sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank.
Technology shares are losing ground under their feet.
The paper market is down.
The government's estimate of 10-year-olds rose to 3,540% versus 3,482% on Wednesday night and with 30-year-olds increased to 4,497% versus 4,492% on the previous day.
Miss World election again in the South African Republic.
After a month's journey across the South African Republic, 112 candidates on the title Miss World are going to cross the target time on Saturday to reach their dream: to be chosen by the most beautiful woman in the world in front of billions of TV viewers.
This great celebration of beauty has been held in Johannesburg for the second year, and for the time being, five candidates have obtained a procedure for the semifinal.
Miss Japanese Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Maová from Canada were chosen Miss sport or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real faith of events.
It was wonderful to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things, and I've had so many experiences!
The competition, which takes place in the South African Republic after the ninth, will be broadcast in a direct transfer from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17 hours (15 hours of world time).
I couldn't dream of a more beautiful country where I'd put my crown in.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm glad I could have enjoyed it twice, and I've been engaged to Miss Xenia Sukhin's world, in the hot south summer.
For young Russia, her second residence in the South African Republic was carried in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and a new revelation of the country and her "dreaming country".
After a month of performances, trials, press meetings and safari, Miss is now focusing on the competition itself.
Indka Pooja Chopraová hopes to go in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopraova, elected in 2000, who will also participate in Ashwarye Rai, the 1994 winners, who became the two stars of Bollywood.
To be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman's dream, but it's not just about sight.
We're polite to our countries and I want to go home with a crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th anniversary will be carried in the spirit of music and dance.
The candidates are presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimwear.
The presentation will be presented by the Chinese TV moderator Angela Chow, former Queen of the South African Republic Michelle McLean, and the chairman of the board of Miss Steve Douglas.
The South African Republic has shown that it is able to welcome the world with the heat it is difficult to deal with, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World Competition.
The candidates, like last year, attended the safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time on the bike, and enjoyed local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
For the president, she noticed Miss Sierra Leone.
The most beautiful memory will remain in Cape Town (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will take place in June 2010, which helped the country to support the event more.
I could have met people that didn't even happen to me.
I'm sure I'm going back to the World Cup 2010, says with enthusiasm Ms. Italia Alice Taticchi.
According to David's son, the news of Hallyday's status is "very positive".
News of Johnny Hallyday's condition is "very positive", as his son David assured us on his Friday arrival at the airport in Los Angeles, where he flew to visit his father, who had been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong and everything is going very well, said David Hallyday at the departure of the plane he flew from Paris at the 13th hour of local time (21st hour of world time)
The singer's son, who acted peacefully, declared that "as soon as possible" would be delivered to the L.C.C.-Sinaï hospital, where Johny Hallyday was accepted on Monday for post-operative infection caused by the operation of a heated inter-breeding plant, which took place on November 26th in Paris.
According to the press statement, the night was sung in Los Angeles for convenience "introduced into artificial sleep", which should prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was a doctor at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles already mentioned in an art sleep. Hospitalization was due to an infection after the operation of a heated inter-breeding plate carried out on November 26th in Paris.
For the serious damage caused by this attack , the singer had to be operated again at night from Wednesday to Thursday .
According to the photographer AFP, his wife Laeticia attended a French school performance in Los Angeles on Friday morning, visiting their daughter Jade.
Advantage of the department of orthopaedic surgery and traumatology hospital la Pitié-Salpétrière, Yves Catoné, announced that the singer to Los Angeles is leaving on Monday.
The producer strongly accused Dr. Stéphana Delajouxe, a neurosurgeon who performed at Clinique International du Parc Monceau in Paris on November 26.
They told us it was a massacre.
The L.A. surgeons declared they were under arrest, Mr. Camus said.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, I said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "has gone too fast to Los Angeles and that with the permission of his Parisian surgeon."
I personally spoke to the doctor on the phone, and he assured me that this trip was no problem, which surprised me greatly, since I had suffered twice as much as I had suffered from the inter-British plate.
Just a minute ago at the radio station RTL stated that the singer apparently flew after the Paris operation without a drain, without anything."
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in artistic circles.
He operated the actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at a hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, which he then acted on.
In 2007, he also operated an actress, Charlotte Gainsburg, in the elimination of haematoma, caused by brain bleeding.
He is also a doctor with a dark reputation, however, several times convicted of neglecting medical care, for tax evasion and fraud.
Dr. Olivier Metzner referred to him as a "man without screws", who is "regularly" called before the medical chamber, and which cannot be "recommended far".
After several silences, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on the matter on Friday through his lawyer David Koubbi.
He announced that the move had "a very good course" and the post-operative investigation was "normal".
The operation was not hemorrhagic, so it was not necessary to introduce the drain," he added.
The health problems of the singer have grown since this year and, in any case, it seems that the next tour of the singer remains with the question.
It is clear that the deadline for the renewal of the planned tour on 8 January (In Amiensa, known as the Order) appears to be too close, Camus declared.
The UDF Association raises the tone and calls on the New Centre to continue to use their shorts.
The UDF association, controlled by MoDemFrançoise Bayroua, responded on Friday to the attempt of the President of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morina to make a brief commitment to the former Giscard's party by not using any media in a short time under the threat of criminal harassment.
Herv Morin publicly announced his intention to assign a short UDF to François Bayru that he did not deserve to carry her inheritance after he gave his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, has planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council for the Movement of the Nouveau Centre (NC).
This step was supported by Mrs Hervé de Charett (formerly ZA-UMP now for NC) who subscribed to the UDF brand because it was the first to have it registered in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la propriété industriale).
But on Friday evening, the Committee of the UDF Association of Governing Friends Françoise Bayroua, who do not intend to get out of the way, came out of his silence and formally requested the Minister and the MPs to stop using short and hand back the protection signs under threat of criminal harassment.
In recent days, you have raised the alarming statement that you are proposing your political move + to take over + a short UDF, writes the Association in its letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the Committee, such as François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, by MoDem or Senator Jean Arthuis of the Alliance of Centrists.
At the same time you considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your moving name+Nouveau center+, with the slogan +UDF today+, signatories also note.
As you know, you have no right to use this summary, explains the UDF Committee, which requests the NC movement to remove all UDF names from all promotional materials including (its) websites."
At the same time, Hervé de Charettea asks "to hand over the ownership of trademarks to legitimate owners".
If you do not do so, we will turn to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, signatories will warn.
In their letter they state that the UDF "is a full political movement in 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends "elected" to leave in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as did others in 2002 to establish the UMP.
According to them, therefore, the New Centre has no right to use a short UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time, it is recalled that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and to set up a committee responsible for promoting the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscardm d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charettea, the committee continues, "when he registered the protection mark", it was "not three years of UDF membership", but UMP.
In a scandalous and subversive way, he used the non-existing registration of an acronym to do so on his own account.
This inaction begins to become a criminal act, they declare, and then with irony they express themselves to the NC strategy: "It seems to us that both in politics and in the ordinary life it is more valuable to create a name for ourselves than to emerge from anonymity with a subjugated name that we have no right to".
The Liliane Bettencourt case : François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of the state of weakness.
The court in Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist Françoise-Marie Banier and to judge whether he had used the state of weakness of eighteen billionaires to prepare her for part of her estate, from which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt was guilty.
The photographer (62 years), known by his photographs of fame, will be sentenced on 15 and 16 April 2010 to abuse the state of weakness, which is a criminal offence for which the penalty is imposed for a maximum duration of 3 years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This Decision confirms that there is a real process of causation, which can be described as the family of the sag of one of the richest families in France in which the mother is attacked with the daughter and is fighting to control the cosmetic empire of L'Oréal.
At the same time, the 15th criminal court ordered a medical trial of 87 years by Lilian Bettencourt, which should be conducted by three doctors.
L'Oréal’s grandfather and principal shareholder always refused to undertake such an investigation, certainly not under the conditions offered by the State representatives in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors elected on Friday should prepare a report by 10 March 2010 and at the same time give an opinion on whether Liliana Bettencourt could be found in a state of weakness and during which time.
I think she's gonna be there.
I'm going to talk to her about it, and after hearing Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kyejman.
As for lawyer Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Oliver Metzner, this decision was welcomed by the court.
It's an excellent report(...). Expertise shows that with this old lady who needs protection, he has manipulated (M. Banier), confirmed.
Two years ago, Liliana Bettencourt's only daughter started a criminal trial against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and an ally who blames her for taking advantage of her mother's disability for a long time to obtain a billion euro in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master's pictures.
So Liliane Bettencourt always refused to be manipulated by a photographer whom she considered to be a long-term friend.
While the court had to judge the jurisdiction of Mrs Bettencourt-Mayers' case, the Friday lawyer's speech changed in the family's time of truth.
Lawyer Liliany Bettencourt submitted three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary, expressing his distrust of his husband, François Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a letter from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt, according to the lawyer, adds: "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier for fifteen years to twice a day.
Ever since she got married, I've never been able to talk to Françoise."
The State representation in Nanterre once again found that the complainant's proceedings were not justified, since the supervisory judge rejected her application for the initiation of the procedure for the issue of legal protection for her mother in those days.
Liliane Bettencourt "is quite able to participate in the court, is not under protection or custody.
No one else will act for her," confirmed the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court decided that Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be entitled to speak at the time of the initiation of the proceedings.
The Manager's Revolution or the End of Economic Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our fight for economic intelligence development was unnecessary...
For more than ten years, he has been reminding the management of large companies' management of companies' access to companies before the marketing revolution: it is for employees to associate themselves with the "values" set out in the mountain, as it used to be when consumers had to use products derived from the ideas of major manufacturing techniques.
By becoming the center of business companies, the marketing revolution compared the market acquisition strategy in the right direction...and even when authoritarian efforts to use products different from customer preferences are returned regularly!
Passive employee approach can lead to deadly demoderation.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only visible parts of a much wider global phenomenon that involves mostly managerial structures.
This demobilisation adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and what is more important, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "needs active access and ability to predict from all parties involved (...) and requires the employees of a commitment that is completely contrary to the revenues of authoritarian management.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution, which should aim to bring workers into the business's centre of interest as well as the customer.
Relative utility of internal public opinion research.
Internal public opinion polls - as a questionnaire submitted to employees of Orange - contribute to the revolution in managerial procedures?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Especially because I've already convinced myself that face-to-face the new situation, the structure after the different opposites will return preferably to what she's always done!
Furthermore, authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases moderately with the seriousness of its own failures.
And finally, because most managers have a simple view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of high school for engineers, they have mechanical interpretations of psychology.
For the sake of ease of thought, they are winning an old behavioristic theory, currently relived by the "neutrons" from the United States and widely spread without greater knowledge of scientific institutions and the media.
With the possibility of moving "pakami" (sic) involvement of managers, he showed a recent survey of the agency Ipsos on Figaro.fr, which only establishes managers in their position of mechanical management, which is not suitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors.
On the contrary, the management revolution is necessary for the proper functioning of modern businesses, assuming the adoption of a final vision of human behavior.
It is included in the inclusion of the basic survey into all the objectives and practices of the management: For employees, commitments to the company will only be possible if they appear as a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At the present time, this concept of employee motivation is only under consideration in the study Reasonably functional analysis.
These studies have shown that the evaluation of their companies on the basis of pre-defined doxes, which enables them, through the image that speaks of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, managers can control, predict and anticipate their "social performances" and introduce their management of human resources "on the right path".
This creates a living ground for the development of solid and effective economic intelligence.
I'm saying from Oslo: "just war" Obama earned his credit on the right.
U.S. law on Friday welcomed Barack Obama's speech the day before in Oslo, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize holder in 2009 defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who first mocked Obama's award of the prize on 9 October, this time pressed for the presidential speech, including Sarah Palin, the former candidates for the Vice-President in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Palin, a museum of the right-wing Republican wing, for the U.S. Today newspaper, and added that she herself expressed her "sometimes needed" wars in her memories, which are just coming out.
Of course, the war is the last thing the Americans would want to do, but it's necessary.
All terrorists need to be held there, they think.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessor George W. Bush, justified the dispatch of forces in Oslo on Thursday and used an expression to explain his decision to send another 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
The next opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, considered the president to be doing a "very good job" in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really very good, thank you for the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the President's mention of "the existence of evil in the world".
In my own way, I considered this speech completely historical, I declared Gingrich during the interview on the radio "The Takeaway".
The former MP, whom some consider to be a potential Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential elections, was thrilled to see the "recording president" remind members of the Nobel Prize Committee," that they themselves would not be free and could not transfer the prize for peace if the use of force did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, former author of George W. Bush's speech, now editor Washington Post, Obama presented "very American speech".
Not only did he represent himself as a "world citizen" as always, but he "talked as an American president" and reminded Europeans "that they live in a safe bubble that they did not create themselves and that they did not do too much to keep it," Gerson said.
Among the few right-wing dissatisfactions are Bushovy Ery, a former ambassador at the United Nations John Bolton, who has identified the speech as "unique, bold and without inspiration", as stated on the National Review Online website .
On the left of the President, for example, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is afraid to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
"When we wrap the war into a package of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the middle-aged press is in favour of the President with a favourable opinion.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to consider granting Obama's peace prize as a temporary one, he assessed his performance as a "survival" and also for a speaker known as his talent.
The talk from Oslo should serve as a guide to international decision-making in conflict, in the fight against poverty and oppression," the California Journal states.
Obama "declared what was needed," assessed the New York Times, and marked "for simple and instructive".
Road transporters: three maratones to an agreement that saves the supply of resources for Christmas.
After three marathons, road transport committees and TLF, the only organisation of employees that remained until the end of Friday evening came to an agreement that ended the call for a state and threat that hung over the supply of Christmas supplies.
The State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, at the Friday signing of the agreement, expressed "rejoice" after several talks that began in the middle of the morning.
After the second night of discussion, the negotiators broke up early Friday morning hoping that the text of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible by the end of the morning.
Even though three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) have resigned from the discussion.
But there was a need for more than six hours of the meeting, which began in 11 hours to allow everyone to agree and in 18 hours to sign the agreement.
This conflict "would hurt businesses a lot" and "dangerous that the holidays would be disrupted at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text includes an increase in wages by 4% in the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% in the highest wages (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest wages is increased from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but there's a lot of effort behind it, explains Patricia Clos (FO).
Tonight, we'll give our members an order not to leave the locks, no locks on the supply centres.
But there may be a few more opponents who are not at ease," he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed the "correct agreement", although it was difficult to admit an increase in high wages due to international competition".
According to it, an increase of 170 euros per month for the lowest wages and between 100 and 120 euros for the highest.
It is a healthy agreement and respect for employees, said CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Doine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an "acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides for a revalidation of travel costs of 3% and a report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also focus on the issue of payment 13 and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled "a reduction of EUR 100 million in corporate wages tax" which was the subject of a proposal by the Government for a 2009 budget bill, which was voted on at night from Thursday to Friday at the National Assembly.
The government is asking the Senate for a "good" vote.
The signature enables this agreement to apply firstly to enterprises which are members of this organisation, later on to the whole sector, in the case of expansion to the Ministry of Labour.
He's going to be "in the shortest possible time," he assured Bussereau.
The whole process can only undermine the disagreement of employers' organisation.
The FNTR organisation is talking about "bad trade" because 100 million euros have already been offered to the sector as part of the compensation of carbon tax".
The State Secretary for Transport has forced us to engage in the necessary negotiations, not as a result of an analysis of each other, but because of the fact that he did not vary the number of candles in the coming Christmas season, he complained about Unostra.
For the Otre organisation, the agreement is threatened in the next 12 months "to bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the field".
Regional trains RER A: interruption of the weekend transport, the committees are not satisfied with the proposals of the RATP transport company.
The interruption of the transport on the urban trains of RER A, which is the largest link of urban public transport in France, will continue during the weekend, as Friday's discussions between the committees and the administration of RATP on the second day of the event did not lead to any specific results in the question of the premium.
On Saturdays and Sundays, then the important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will only drive between 10 and 20 hours, on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) will drive every other train, except this section only one train from four.
The SNCF connection will be interrupted at Nanterre Prefecture and passengers will thus be forced to switch to another train.
The business houses of Galeries Lafayette, which expect more than 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP was trying to connect with large business houses".
Link RER A leads from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
Rusk managed by RATP leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye to Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, there was one train in operation from two and virtually no compound was released at the time outside the peak as planned.
Like the people of Ile de France on Thursday, the people of Ile de France did not have a conflict in their seats.
So early in the morning it was at the Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station much less people than usual, including because of the lack of students and students.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he was up about an hour and a half before he was sure he was coming in on time.
Saint-Lazare Station was not overcrowded, the SNCF State Railway announced, the larger number of staff members and officers were predicted.
The regional trains RER A operated SNCF in the direction of or to Cergy-Le-Haut came or departed from Saint-Laszar Station with a subway connection.
Further timely meetings will be held on Saturday and Sundays, on which the results of the Friday afternoon meeting will be evaluated by the committees as "weak".
The RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for the urban trains of RER A on all sites, changes in working hours, careers etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who demand a merit award, according to Thierry Garon (OdboriJh).
The RATP has even for the time being postponed proposals for the premium, which worsened the CGT by "not being able to solve the problem, while it was done by road hauliers and SNCF".
At a new meeting, which is scheduled for Monday, "closer review of the conditions for the performance of the call", the transport companies of RATP clarified.
Which was the reason why the experts think the company is "making fun of weekend travelers."
In the early hours of the morning, about 150 drivers were stationed by the company's committee in its Paris headquarters.
The conduct, which has so far refused any discussion during the event, was therefore decided for the meeting in the interest of "cooling".
The danger is that there will be a conflict on the RER B line on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Independent will announce the emergency.
The Committees apply for a premium of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (Ji), Independents (Independent)) and are charged with increasing working conditions on this line, which daily transports millions of passengers.
Regional train drivers RER earn between 2200 and 2700 euros gross wages and between 600 and 650 euros for irregular working hours and work on Sundays and holidays.
Turkey's justice has dissolved for the Kurdish side, and this decision with it has had serious consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court decided on Friday to abolish the main pro-Kurdish party in the country. This decision immediately triggered a protest in the Kurdish community on the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision can significantly complicate the government's task, which is trying to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and thus try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society's party (DTP) was dissolved because it became "a consequence of the activities of threatening the independence of the state and its indivisible units," the President of the Supreme Court Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of negotiations.
The decision was adopted unanimously by 11 judges, when the majority-seven votes were required to dissolve the party, Kilic stated that 37 parties, including her President Ahmet Turk and Ms Aysely Tugluková, had the right to participate in political life for a period of five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the abolition of the parliamentary immunity that Mr Turk and Mrs Tugluk used and the confiscation of the property of the party to the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP site has 21 seats in Parliament (of 500).
The leadership of the party has already pointed out before the verdict that Members would rather leave Parliament than act as Members without political competence in it.
The decision is to continue the proceedings initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses DTP of obeying the "commands" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider to be a terrorist organization.
Many observers are convinced that DTP is the legal political vitrination of the PKK rebels.
The party ensures that the PKK has no "fundamental connection", but refuses to mark it as a terrorist organization and urges the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict comes at a time when the Government gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and tries to limit Kurd's support to the PKK and end such a conflict.
The DTP has confirmed that the party's dissolution could lead to a recovery of tension in the South-East of Anatolia, where in recent weeks many demonstrations have been rejected against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan is held in custody with the police.
Since the announcement of the justice decision, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large town in the south-east, mostly Kurdish.
Police used tear grenades and waterworks, demonstrators threw Molotov's cocktails again or shot stones from the dust.
There were about a hundred people in Istanbul, too.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk stated that the decision of justice would only be "deeper despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this question (Kurdow, p. r.) by banning the party, he said in the press.
The government, created by the party from the Islamic movement, also condemned this decision.
We're from the principles against breaking sides.
It doesn't matter, the Energy Minister said Taner Yildiz.
This decision was a direct reflection of the democratic proposals launched by the government, said politician Ahmet Island.
Of course we can wait for the PKK's response, given.
On Thursday, the PKK reported on one of the most deadly attacks in northern Turkey, which killed seven soldiers in three days ago.
Snow can come
Pretty cool winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass citizens, says the head of the FES Technical Services Department.
But that's so that his employees can try and learn to control all the train techniques.
It could be the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
It is equipped with over 300 employees and 120 vehicles to take care of snow and ice.
However, the FES is acting in accordance with the exact plan.
As soon as the snow in Frankfurt falls completely and the temperatures fall below zero, they will go to 20 so-called sections, and in a large way, explains Brauburger.
These sections include the main and transit routes such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, urban public transport lines, walking zones and sections with falling like Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at three o'clock in the morning.
In case of need, it is necessary for a maximum of three hours to store a wet salt, which is better kept, something about 1040 kilometers.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock in the night, "that the roads would be free when transport to work begins."
It's not easy when it starts snowing at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the Winter Department of Technical Services, "because no one is willing to make a place for the sleepers."
Only when it's not too snowy are there a number of incoming and connecting communications, including Rat-Beil-Strasse.
The last priority is side and sideways.
Brauburger knows they're gonna complain.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES pedestrians will be on their way, preferably to clean up dangerous places and crossings.
The FES cannot take care of all cyclists with the majority.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which follows from 22 to 4.30 bridges in particular, says Brauburger.
Since the ice is rapidly formed on them, the temperature will disappear immediately as the temperature falls below two degrees.
If necessary, they will also be called by the police.
Dinosaurs complex
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other massive dinosaurs: the animal was two feet long and 1.50 feet high after two strong rear limbs, had a long skull with sharp, swollen teeth, short front limbs with a slender scratch and a long tail.
If this species lived a few million years later, it wouldn't be great.
Sterling Nesbitt from University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the Thursday issue of Science writes that Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body signs.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was then located in the equatorial dry area of the Pangea supercontinent.
Tawa opens a new window to the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about relationships, enlargement and early dinosaurs.
In 2006 Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging in Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes in one day we found a dozen dinosaur bones, which is unknown to the trias, a member of the Randall Irmis team from the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones identified scientists quickly as a new species.
During the excavation, the remains were collected with a total of five individuals.
The findings confirm the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it's an unusual finding: "The fossils of the dinosaurs from the triasis are very rare, most of them will find only individual fragments."
Other dinosaur experts don't share this enthusiasm without a warrant.
Especially sensational this finding is not, but it confirms some theory about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the association of the originals is mostly controversial.
Experts discuss, for example, when the ostrichs were divided into three main development lines: the mass - feeding thermopods, which later belonged to the Tyranosaurus rég, Velociroptor and the birds, the "long - cut" four soropoids and their relatives, and the herbivores of Ornithischia (the apoch), which belonged to, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is an initial therapist after analysis of Nesbitta and his colleagues.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On Tawa hallae's liver, researchers found, for example, evidence of the airflows that also have the offspring of the terapods of birds.
Thanks to air vacuums, the breathing of birds is more effective than the sands.
At Tawa Hallae, the bones of the five were obviously filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive helicopter with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the relative lines of the giant souropods also later had air bags and light bones, this useful innovation was already likely a common front for both groups.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs have lived in South America so far, scientists have been able to say that the dinosaurs first appeared there.
According to this, the three development lines were divided early and extended from South America to all the continents that then formed a single Earth mass as the Pangea supercontinent.
She would also talk about the fact that the team found the remains of two others along with Tawa hallae, especially close to the relatives.
The three can't come from a common, immigrant ancestor, the scientists argue.
We believe that there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of a scientific study.
Of course, there are differences too.
One even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a group of the most difficult dinosaurs, lived in Poland today, says the Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His belief could give a painted picture together, because in South America there remained very many primitive fossils of dinosaurs, and on other continents there are rarely.
As dinosaurs have proved, the relatively rare sideline of the plazas has evolved to rule the earth’s rulers during the Middle Ages, it remains a struggle.
During the triasis, dinosaurs shared their living space with many other beaches, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying lobsters and countless other lobsters.
The collapse at the end of the trias has spread throughout the world and has developed many new species, while relatives have died and the division of the trias and juries.
The History of Success Has Not Lasted Forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
It could have been a mass measurement that dinosaurs had happened to survive, but the beach didn't.
Or dinosaurs were better prepared, so they could push out competition.
The history of success didn't last forever.
About 150 million years later, another group of animals were hit by meteorite, which also developed in the triaas and lived in the shadow of the day.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors at University Toronto, University of Cambridge, Vienna University or Berkeley in California.
Students from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, São Paulo, Berlin or Brém joined.
The police clearance of the seized Frankfurt Goethe University casino was a global distraction.
278 professors and teachers of Goeth University, but also high schools all over Germany, Europe and North and South America solidarity with Protestant students at the Western campus.
In a statement by the German and English writer "does not approve" the president of the police force.
Because there were numerous walls and works of art, the university president Werner Müller-Estler allowed the building to be cleaned, which was planted last week by present students and lecturers.
At that time, five students were injured.
The damage done to things, the judges signatories, do not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized student training and teaching by the police command".
Clearance is an "acceptable intervention" into freedom of research and science.
The exceptional focus on vandalism is on "injustice and criminalisation of protest" and draws attention to the contents.
The Bureau avoided the necessary discussion.
The rapporteurs are calling for a suspension of criminal proceedings.
It is claimed that most interns did not support material injury.
Authorised protest
The youth committee organization Verdi and the German board bond also unites students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern about its own future, says the mysterious Earth Youths of Verdi Alexander Klein.
The Hessen Ministry of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) has so far run the proceedings of the university president and police.
We're grateful to the university president.
Termination and storage are totally unacceptable, said on Thursday at the Current Hour in the Wiesbaden Land Film.
We have an understanding for the protest, but we don't have any understanding for vandalism, the MP of the Earth Record said for the CDU Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, they saw the opposition SPD, the Greens and the Left.
The CDU takes a painted wall behind the curtain to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and requirements of the students, there was a clearing up.
Linke submitted a proposal that calls on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police situation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it has been a secret city, not accessible to visitors from the west.
Greenegrad, one of the ten periods of Moscow’s capital city, in the Soviet Union, was a closely guarded location where a secret military research was carried out.
Today, this period is considered to be 216,000 inhabitants, 37 km from the Moscow centre, as "Russian Silicon Valley".
The main micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centres are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of the Green City Centre have been in contact with the Frankfurt scientific centre Riedberg - with the university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There have been several mutual visits and on Wednesday they signed in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg "Protocol on Close Cooperation".
The Russian delegation led the Moscow mayor, Jurij Rosljak, and the Prefect of the Greengrad Anatoli Smirnov, signed for Frankfurt the lead planning rapporteur Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, FIZ representatives and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in natural science research will go to a seminar in Zelenegrad.
Scientific exchange
It's a continuous scientific exchange.
It's also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to catch themselves on a growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to get orders in Germany.
Greenegrad is the home of major Russian research institutions and companies.
Among them are the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the major Sitronics and Russian Electronics groups.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for weapons research.
Greenegrad (a literal translation of "Green City") received its name according to the forested hilly landscapes in which research facilities are planted.
Stuttgart brake
The Stuttgart 21 dimension is not enough to be prepared at all.
For the proponents of the project, it is quite simply a "new heart of Europe".
The S21 is more than the launch of the station, more than a monstrosity building that will throw the main city of Bádenska-Württemberg for one decade into desperate building chaos.
Stuttgart was born in the spirit of the '80s.
The main stations with trains that ended in the city centre were then considered transport-technical fossils of the 19th century, which act as brakes of modern rail transport, because it took a huge amount of time to cross the locomotives from the front.
Take a moment to stop, move on, so it should work.
And that's why he's leaving the main station: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies close to half the trans-European railway trade fairs between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, is therefore the slogan of "the heart of Europe".
In fact, it starts with S21, although the 80-year-old visas are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves knew that the start of the building in Hessen and Bavarian capital was almost non-financial.
Since the existence of modern quadrilateral trains with motor and driving vehicles on both ends, there have been no problems in driving and driving.
However: Stuttgart begins 21 including new routes ICE to Ulma.
It's a land and a community policy.
The routes are also co-operating because the risk of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic is borne by a taxpayer and not by a state group.
Urbanist projects can be excused in some other way.
A new city space will emerge, which, if we believe in computer images of designers, will contain a lot of green.
For the rail transport system S21 is harmful.
Passive station and track construction are intended for personal transport, which - typically in the 1980s - has attributed a huge increase.
At the time, there was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern transport policy must go, however, first of all, to strengthen freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than freight cars on the road.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains due to a steep climb.
More serious is that S21 directly affects many other railway projects.
In Switzerland, good six billion euros should be buried.
That's an official number.
Experts consider a real ten to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade, there will be a lack of funding for other catch points and narrow spots on the network.
There are sixty larger projects on the Transport Ministry list.
One of the most important is the construction of about 180 kilometers of long road along the Rhine.
From 1987 on this route is being built at a slow pace.
There's a need to push right here.
But S21 will be like a brake.
The trail of the Rhine will become the backbone of international freight transport: directly in the heart of Europe.
The government is examining the judgment on the airport
The Land Government has left open in the Wiesbaden Land Snow if it goes against the judgment of the Hessen Administrative Court (VGH) regarding the prohibition of night flights and is allowed to review it.
The CDU/FDP Coalitions have entrusted experts with legal review of more than 400-page VGH judgements, said the Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
VGH, in Kassel, today argued in writing that in the event of a construction planned for the north-west border of Frankfurt airport, the state would have to re-adjust the night flight ban.
The permit of 17 years between 23 and 5 hours, as suggested by the Land Government, does not comply with the law for the protection of the population from night noise.
Coalitions must be decided by 4 January if they require a review of the judgment.
The opposition criticised this postponement and approached the government's representative to reject the revision of the Spolko Administrative Court in Lipsk.
The head of the SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel group called for the CDU and FDP to return to the promises about the ban on nights that she made before the election. Otherwise, it is possible to evaluate it as "a violation of the word".
It's damn hard if you can keep your word, chief Green Tarek Al-Wazir said in violation of the FDP "We hold the word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's exodus, the Land government is trying to get to its night flights through "transgression of rights and tricks".
Right legal control takes its time.
Coalitions don't want to work on the basis of "fast first impression".
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The fates of his party to ban night flights have never been the same as the opposition.
US Banks Payment Assistance
America's, uh, crisis-stricken big banks are getting rid of state flights.
The Bank of America paid a loan on average from the Tarp Savings Fund for a total of $45 billion (about €30 billion).
According to the report, CNBC is planning to pay State aid to Citigroup as well.
In this way, the constitutions want to get rid of the restriction that money was received - the restriction on the payment of bonuses to managers and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America has made $19 billion available to investors through variable bonds.
The rest of the amount was taken from its treasure, which was filled out, inter alia, by the sales of the committee.
The bank manager Kenneth Lewis expressed his appreciation to the US taxpayer on Wednesday night: Money injections helped us to overcome a difficult time.
The monetary institution has damaged the top of the financial crisis by taking over Merrill Lynch's investment bank.
Citigroup wants to get rid of its obligations to the State by also making money on the capital market.
The CNBC informed the source that this US bank could already announce a capital increase of approximately $20 billion on Thursday.
The Citigroup spokesperson didn't want to express himself.
In June they paid for the aid already Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick Select
It was faster than expected.
The station introduced the successor only two weeks after the board of directors of the ZDF expelled from the office of chief editor Nikolaus Brender.
Last night, the band wanted to agree on that person.
Peter Frey, the head of the ZDF study in the main city of Berlin, was named for the favorite.
But the station didn't confirm it - officially, not to prevent the process.
However, the role could also be played by the fact that they did not want to harm the ZDF interpreter Markus Schächter if this proposal did not go through with the Governing Council.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the jury.
The result of the vote was unknown before the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, he cut off Schächter's board of directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Brender's loss of mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächther, although it was expected.
The majority of the Union in the Governing Council had already signaled several weeks before the elections that it did not want to confirm Brender in the office.
The opposition to the chief editor was organised by Hesen Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He rejected further interruptions in the Office of the highly respected chief editor on the grounds that, for Brender, the rates of monitoring of the ZDF's reporting were reduced.
Until shortly before the election, therefore, there were protests that strongly criticised the political influence of the ZDF.
Finally, there were even 35 state lawmakers involved in the debate, who were the object of Koch's evaluation process.
It wasn't about anything.
About person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy, and romance.
Then he worked for the Southwest Funk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey went to the ZDF, first to the Heute-Journal.
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur chief editor; 1991/92 writer in Washington; until 1998 leader and moderator "Morgenmagazines"; until 2001 head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF main study.
After Brender, who was elected on Wednesday by the media magazine magazine of the year, satsazen, announced to the Greens that they filed a constitutional complaint.
Love's opposition to the Governing Council, Rynko-Falk Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the Spolk countries should amend the State Agreement with the ZDF so that personal proposals of the intentions could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also refused to exclude the party policies from the ZDF Supervisory Board.
Brender's alleged successor Peter Frey advised the board of directors with a smart chess tack - immediately after Brender's meeting, he criticised him strongly for it.
As a result of this evidence of journalistic independence, he could nominate him instead of the chief editor without losing face like Schächter, so he could be elected by the board without becoming suspicious of the party being pushed into the office.
In lateral arithmetic, Frey is so many of the left-wing liberals.
The study is free of Harampadi
A partial success for students: After the year of the event, the Ministry of Culture took place on Thursday in the Spolk countries: at the conference of the Ministers of Culture and of the School of Directors, both parties agreed that it was their will to improve the study conditions for baccalators and magistrates.
Students should be able to handle their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the burden of testing: In principle, each study module should end with a single test.
In addition, the workload of students should be monitored and "real and protective measures" should be guaranteed.
Politicians and high schools want to simplify the recognition of exams between high schools in Germany and abroad.
Spock countries undertake to create a more flexible common structural task for the baccalary and master study fields.
Earth's deviations should cease to exist.
Less Tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, ministers of culture and university rectors have had round words about a better study.
Now they're first filled with specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Council has found that the number of tests in part is drastically reduced: "Each module will normally be completed by only one test," the 30-page report says, which is intended in part to regulate the approval of the study fields.
"A much lower test burden," said the President of the Reinhold Grimm Accreditation Board, "is to be halted by a misdevelopment that significantly limited the scope of the study."
To this end, the "prevention of study" in the future "deciding criteria" should be implemented.
Modules and contents "must be severely checked" to "not necessarily limit students in choice
Seminars."
Students should have "a space to enable and support their own initiative".
The rules are to be applied in the approval of new study areas, after examination, but also for existing study areas.
You need to "recredit" every five years – however, it means that it will take until 2015 before all the study sectors are over-checked.
It is the responsibility of ten accreditation agencies throughout Germany, which are subject to accreditation boards set up by the social partners.
In October, the Ministers of Culture called on the "significant" slum countries to act on the agencies so that the full learning was not too large and the test regime was not strict.
In each country, universities and high schools have already agreed with the national ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country has so far pledged additional funds for further development of the Bologna Process.
From the money, high schools should primarily build consultation programmes and study advice, and strengthen experimental and foreign authorities.
This is what countries and high schools want to spend ten million euros on it.
At the beginning of 2010, he wants to introduce a new law to parliament.
According to it, only one test should be required to complete the study module.
The training of the study should be even more flexible, and the recognition of tests from other high schools should be guaranteed and the access of the master should be facilitated.
By the end of the following year, the ownership of all study areas in the country should be monitored.
On Thursday, the government and opposition discussed the country's study conditions again.
The criticism of the resolution was also accompanied by praise.
Juso's community representation of the high-school groups called for the creation of education policy not to be played in the future by the "closed doors" of ministers and high-school teachers.
At the latest after the event, students as well as the people concerned should "speak to them at least a word".
The future academics also received support from the President of the Conference of Higher School Rectors (HRK), Margreti Wintermantel: "We need student experience," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture, with which the HRK discussed a joint reform report.
According to the Committees for Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolution did not go far enough: they require a legal claim that would allow every bachelor with a baccalary title to access the building master's study.
Secondly, the spolk countries must ensure that for today's generation of students in the baccalary fields there will be enough seats available tomorrow in the master's studies with the best study conditions, said a member of the GEW Andreas Keller.
The country of origin must employ far more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express their free access to the Master's programmes.
More than a note under the spell to Hert Müller
Getting to Germany and out is nice, almost no control..." the opening line of a poem by Werner Söllner, who is discussing the experience with the participation of a dissident who has gained freedom, at the same time, but also the language environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Banata, worked first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer of one of the children's bookstores, then moved to Frankfurt on Mohan in 1982.
Söllner was awarded various literary awards, 1993 presented poetry at the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002, he has been the head of the Hesen Literature Forum in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He took care of a significant microliterary explosion last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, where he referred to "German literature in Romania in mirror and broken mirror of its security acts".
Apparently defeated and infected Söllner left a statement in which Romanian writers, Mr Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, admitted to cooperation as a secret informant of the Romanian Secret Service Security.
Together with some of the present, Söllner received the German language price in 1989.
The recruitment attempts began indisputably, first in 1971.
I'm, Söllner went on, "then someone who didn't resist enough security threats."
Ambassador Werner Söllner is secret agent Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize for Herze Müllerová and her unparalleled literary arrangement with the mechanisms of the dictatorial government is a literary scene, and especially the community of German authors from Romania, is struck by a case that denotes the depth and disgrace of the political system, which is based on control and speculation.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said according to the state of knowledge today, only the perpetrator, but also the victim.
In the Acts of Security, secret agent Walter played a role, said after Söllner's confession Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of secret agent Walter.
"He was cutting me off" then in all the key points for him, says Markel.
He has a moral duty to make this note.
Söllner's statement was in this form and was unexpected to this audience, but it is quite surprising that the former dissident's confession and his cooperation with Romanian secret service is not.
Herta Müller wrote already in July when she read her own papers, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for mirror safety.
Touching, you can assume, they'll speculate and in some cases even know what name is hidden behind the cover name Sorin, Voic, and also Walter.
Unlike in the country, in the meantime, a very certain view of the ingredients of the Stazi, manipulation with the rest of the security controls is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic light has been waned and limited.
One of the Birthler authorities, which corresponds to the National Council for the Processing of Safety Components (CNSAS), was established only in 1999, the issue of an act has been carried out more recently since that time.
Only since 2005 is there a law governing the management of the files.
The fact that former Security members still have a great influence in Romania, after publishing the Nobel Prize for Hert Müller's interview, in which one of the former Chiefs of Security from Temesvara expressed his rejection of the rating holder.
He's got a psychosis, and she's been interrogated only once.
The subjugation of power was expressed here entirely in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, in the case of Söllner, as in the case of a silent apology, there are inevitable questions.
The special reaction of listeners to Söllner's confession makes it possible to expect that the continuation of this chapter will result in a more desire for knowledge than after the dedication of the wine and the study.
To the genius of Herty Müller, who accepted the Nobel Prize yesterday, that's more than a note under the spell.
Charged deposit Champions League
It seemed as if a purely dressed trade representative came from a delicious Christmas party on which the manufacturer of the sports goods of sweetness, when he performed a quarter hour after midnight in the invited Mercedes class C new coach VfBr Christian Gross following an orange coloured sponsor bag.
A man with a brandy danced for him to let another city follow him.
Otherwise he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and drunk luck was also little.
It was a good evening, but tomorrow he's going to go to work.
Or it's just getting started.
The words only three days of Switzerland's engagement: "We've reached the eighths", because in the Champions League, thanks to winning3:1 over the Unire Urziceni from Romania, "we can't let ourselves be successful: it'll be a brutally hard fight against resignation."
"A far more important task" stands before us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance of the royal class in Mohuči on ordinary days.
And stop the obvious weaknesses again after three quick angles of Marice (5), Träsche (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Disposal
The Champions League will be released on 18 December in Nyon on 18 February.
So the joy of Babbel's striking performance will be maintained.
Not only was the supposed doctor who gave the non-Suttgart professionals a short time of self-consciousness, willingness to set up and joy from the game.
I went to the players and told them that they were going to focus on their strong pages and I urged them to be more courageous, explained the doctor of the soul Gross so simply knowing the successful recipe, which, but for the operation of the Babbel therapist, did not prove any effectiveness.
He blew up some magic, admitted Babbel's proponent Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in the football, things happen sometimes that you don't consider possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a multiweek break caused by injury, became the best player in the game, tried to describe the discovered "phenomen" with the word "screaming wind" and the working procedures of the new superintendent: "He is a man who is radical and requires discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
It's obviously missing Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, warns sports president Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart needs more stamina.
As Gross, the players and managers do not want to overestimate the victory against the weakened replacement and completely overrun defense of the Romanian guest.
They would win even in Glasgow before a severe awakening after defeat 0:4 in Leverkus, Khedira thinks.
And sports president Horst Heldt recalled that while one goal has been achieved in the season, the other is still far away.
We're not water yet.
That Heldt was not celebrating his 40th birthday even after his first home victory in three months, it was due to the weekend events that were relived in the form of a television conversation with the winner Jens Lehmann just before the start of the match.
They're decisions that make other people and not Jens, which Heldt put down on Lehman's hard criticism.
He was presupposing the idea of a poor leadership and decided to change the coach after the pressure on the public fans.
And that his free day was canceled after the matches, Lehmann marked as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and addiction.
Lehman's statements "formulating pure selfishness", Heldt reported on the consequences for the farmers.
Both of the four will have no more joy in life.
Anyway, they're at the same time with the others that without the work of a busy coach team, it wouldn't be possible to have such a strong and fighting performance.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great contribution to success," says Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and a man with an igelite bag agrees.
Fighting the world’s championships in a difficult way
A Historic duel in Bern: The challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of the world's champion Vitalie Click.
After 12 hard wheels, however, the Ukrainian defended his title in a heavy weight of the WBC boxing organization.
The verdict was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitalij Click remains the world's champion in the box in a heavy weight.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated Bern American Kevin Johnson on Saturday on the spot (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Click this is the third successful title defense after his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was the world's champion of WBO and WBC twice.
Unfortunately, it didn't happen that everyone was expecting.
The click improved its balance on 39 winnings in 41 professional matches, twice as a result of injury.
The challenger Johnson was first defeated in the 24th.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Bernese arena drove 2,02 meters high Click fight their left.
About eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of Klík’s era before duel, but had come before the strike of the world’s master, so Kliko couldn’t set the decisive impact of his dangerous course.
In total, the passive Johnson made a few calls and tried to get to the next rounds.
The call, however, provoked words and gestures, but the world's champion shook only a few times.
But even so, it's just the second boxer after Tim Hoffmann in 2000, who fought with Klikke with 12 rounds full.
The challenger took care of himself in the main city of Switzerland before the battle.
He attacked the Click as a "responsive zombie," which "nothing can do right."
During the ride on Friday, the champion let himself be provoked, pulled Johnson out of the nose of the sunglasses, "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Click return
The call remained unbeatable after the fourth battle after its return on 11 October 2008.
After nearly four years, he defeated in Berlin, Nigeria, Samuel Peter, and took back his WBC belt, which had to be handed over without a fight.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Areola from the United States in September.
In this fight, I got only one wound and physically I was in good shape, I just got a quick call back in the ring.
His dream, however, remains the defense of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world's champion of WBO and IBF.
But the WBA dog wears Brit David Haye, after sitting on a 2.13 - foot [2.13 m] throne of high Nikolai Vuljev in November.
Haye refused in summer a fight against the Click, which was planned for September.
His promotional company is supposed to plan a fight against Klickov in the London Wembley Stadium.
Kundúz case
Head of the opposition: Head of the Greens Jürgen Trittin Group designated for bad information about the affair Kundúz Minister of Defence Guttenberg for the lie.
SPD and Linke (Levice) invite the office to provide an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest knowledge of Kundúz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has been allowed to deceive himself.
The minister for the deadly bombing of two tanks in September said "consciously not true," said the head of the Green Jürgen Trittin Group in the Saturday news series ARD "Tagesschau".
Let's call it the usual term: lie.
The order for the killing was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Support Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the essence of the message that NATO had read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, it appeared that the attack was not just about the destruction of stolen cargo cars, but about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
In the United States, which the German commander Kunduzu, Colonel Klein, requested, the investigation revealed that up to 142 people were killed or injured by NATO.
Greenie, SPD and Linke called on Ms. Angel Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to express themselves immediately in front of the Spolka dream and also to explain what Guttenberg really knew about this event.
Mrs Merkel has to explain whether the strategy for the purpose of killing members of the Afghan policy in the Spolko Snow - and whether the Office of the Office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service approved this new strategy, called for Jürgen Trittin and colleagues from Green Renate Kunastová.
The Ulrich Wilhelm's speech has definitely turned down criticism.
The Office of the Office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, too, there was a raise of doubts about the Ministry's position on the background of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both Guttenbergs were informed correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the tanks.
It was officially announced that they should deny the existence of NATO reports and shut down the Minister's sensitive details.
From both top officials, however, it was announced that the Ministry of Defence had even pointed out a number of reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
Frankfurter Allgemeineer Sonntagszeitung reports that Wichert should have requested in the meantime in a letter explaining the situation.
It has been noted that he has not received any response so far.
The Ministry did not express itself on Saturday and pointed out that this would be dealt with in the Spolko Snow Investigation Committee, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images in their wake and hear voices that others do not see and do not hear.
Not only psychologically ill or drug addicts cross the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it comes to sleep, it's all right.
If we are in our dark room with closed eyes, we must be surrounded by the wildest ideas and fantasies.
However, those who live in a state of anxiety see and hear things that others do not see and do not hear, usually in the Western world as a fool or drug addict, or at least as a wonder.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in mentally ill or in drug abuse.
We have our imagination: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint images or write novels, here and there, make sure they cross the border between sleep, imagination and reality.
Dreams changed the state of consciousness can occur in the most diverse forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst mistake.
Although the initiator and effect may vary, however, the vision of mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet New-Age Carlos Castanedy, the shaman state of bloating, psychosis and hallucinations can be derived from similar processes.
Hallucination or vision will occur if the balance of neuronal brain transmitters - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and misunderstandings occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity doesn't have much to do with it.
The connection between ignorance and sleep has been between philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of sleep in a awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, found in 1861 "a great similarity of sweating with dreams", for Sigmund Freud was a dream even "psycho, with all nonsense, overcrowding, false senses".
It's autumn 2001, Henning T. is changing in comics.
His body is two-dimensional and crippling.
Gravity has no power over it, it rises at the ceiling of the room.
It's a feeling of excitement.
He's surrounded by hellish characters with blood red worms, priced teeth.
He hunts him, digs into him with heavy fire boots, throws him on the wall, feels pain all over his body.
Loudness, bad voices are threatened from the wall and from the radio.
He can't bear the voices that give him and insult him anymore.
Henning T. will pull two cables out of the stereo, take them into the loop and put them on the hook on the ceiling.
He's going to stand on one of the speakers and he's going to put a stick around his neck.
He's jumping.
The switch's on.
Learn, the voices of the congregation shaking his drums, "Go to the clinic and get treated!"
Today is Henning T. 40 years old, experienced six acute psychos, last two years, first almost 20 years ago.
LSD was released.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, besides it is maniodepressive, taking medications against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
I've had the worst fear and the deepest doubts in my psychiatry, he says.
Prejudice is a horrendous reality
About one percent of people are ill at least once for the life of schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it is the second most commonly treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, the scarcity of most of the inner and outer world cannot be distinguished, they get into a confused state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions or the illusion of persecution.
Especially extended is the hearing of voices - voices that order, comment or conduct dialogues.
Neither are optical hallucinations unusual.
The disabled are unable to distinguish the important from the minor, the brain cannot defiltrate the disruptive signals, the consciousness is flooded.
Just as a dream opens up the psychosis, she has built a flood of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest kinds of knowledge.
The perception of the reality of psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the General Psychiatry University Clinic in Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is located in the center of action, everything is important to him.
At the same time, it gets into a passive role, becomes, like in a dream, overpowered by events and cannot be actively formed.
Schizophrenia is therefore often threatened, controlled and manipulated.
The comparison with reality is not possible in most of them, the ghosts are a terrible fact, the awakening is excluded.
Once for a lifetime to experience hallucinations
Unlike sleep, says Fuchss, "but there remains a sense and spatial structure of reality that one perceives in psychosis, essentially maintained."
Bloody thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, to suppress experience occurs in a real frame.
The scientist is still at the forefront of why our brain is making such a move.
Exceptional conditions can lead to the short-term loss of a relationship to reality, says Fuchs.
Not everyone turns to psychosis.
There seems to be genetic dispositions to schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists are based on the fact that the affected persons have minimal brain damage.
We believe that early development will result in damage to the neural brain, such as the viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
However, there is still a controversy as to how the neuronal system is disrupted, which has not appeared in the years since.
Roles also play the effects around the environment - stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis if they are available to it.
The hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brains go wrong
It's crazy that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, swallow expensive drugs, others give money for drugs to get them, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
If we view overcrowding as pleasant or unpleasant, there is often only one question.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and superstitions for ten years, in last year he interpreted his findings in the book "Die Irreale World in our Kopf" (The Unreal World in Our Head).
Hallucination, however, belongs to the typical associated manifestations of psychosis, but also to a surprising number of other diseases.
In addition to psychiatric disorders such as borderline personality or depression, diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma are common.
It is surprisingly hallucinating under certain conditions and the brain itself of a healthy person.
Hallucination, according to Kasten, consists of the contents of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They notice when parts of the brain in which the senses are processed are too active or too low pressure; if our brain is ingested, or if it is not stimulated.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also incentives, stress, concern with love or other exceptional states.
In recent studies, up to a third of those who have been questioned have experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Prédní Pomārjanska and going to the darkest gymnasium.
Actually, it's a perfectly normal girl.
If there weren't those pictures and voices.
It can happen that she's talking about long, dark hair.
When he answers, the co-workers look at her with surprise - no one else sees her and doesn't hear this boy.
This silly girl thinks she's having a bad dream, but Sarah K. doesn't, she knows.
He's up, he hears and he sees the boy, just like he hears and he sees the girl sitting next to him in the closet.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, the boy likes it.
I'm crazy, she sometimes asks.
But he knows that this boy and other freaks aren't real and he's disappearing again.
At night, the appearances are more striking
It's often too much of a burden.
When he sits in the classroom, he cannot follow the teaching for how many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just a new companion, but he explains to all the others, hearing and visible on the mathematical equation table.
At night, the appearances are more impressive.
When waiting in his dark room for a sleep that comes suddenly and too late, he cannot often discern whether he is awake or if he is already asleep, whether the images he sees, the worms, or the girls with bleeding cutting wounds on their hands and feet come forth before her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she screams at those figures.
He doesn't tell his parents and friends about it, they'd think she was crazy.
The autumn of 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
Vloni has graduated and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she's been on the Internet contacting a psychologist named Kasten, she knows she's been out of her mind.
Overcrowding is also the art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or has his incentives taken, he will be very likely to be hallucinating, says Kasten.
I don't think the brain has enough work to do, and it's taking care of its own fun.
Sarah K., a single girl, was like a little girl afraid of other children, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that a man she's called since she thinks she's not her own father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas that also process real perceptions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected by Sarah K. to distinguish themselves from the mistake and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "is playing in the brain, and reality is also shown there.
Hallucinations are also images that make the brain come up, so it works so real."
Also the night dreams evaluate the Casten as a form of hallucination.
Hallucination of healthy people is not essentially different from hallucination in acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenics, mental health people are able to identify their errors as unrealistic.
Casten therefore advises its patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Border position between sleep and hallucination
In our world too focused on science, the imaginary experience is unfortunately pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg, and head of Psychiatric and Psychotherapy Clinics Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a difficult, painful disease, but it also brings positive, creativeness - overcrowding is also art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard examined the so-called oneroid form of experience, the special form of altered consciousness to sleep.
The oneuroid states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams that the person concerned considers to be real and does not even have the ability to distinguish them from the awake state.
The oneuroid state of consciousness arises in extreme situations caused by trauma or illness, for example in patients with polyradicular infection who are suffering from full knowledge of motor protection.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, perhaps a permanent, complete failure to move, he replaces life threatening the real situation with his own, imaginary world, which is linked to reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
Type of borderline between sleep and hallucination.
Since reality is not possible to deal with a situation, the world changes, but the real situation is present.
Intensive form of support for the meanings and the transfer of meanings in some unbearable situation that enables us to pass on our own ability to form during the moment to the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The historian of art Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (The Exchange of Hearts) as a rescue action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when after surgery, a heart boy with a subsequent heart transplant gave his mind on a several - way journey, and his body was immediately on the intensive care unit.
Claussen went down to the world that he created, visited foreign times and places: He becomes an old man on bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot monitors his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages between the cultivator who manufactures fake substances from the blood.
On the engine, the river takes him to its own power, on the hospital bed surfing on the fir in the Alps and meets the Korean mob.
He's totally sinking into the imaginary event, everything's real, even later in memories.
These internal routes differ in principle from any dream for Claussen.
The dream is a different state, describing its experience.
In contrast to dreams, memories of these mental journeys are still clear after years and in minor details.
Even clearer and more intense than real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, they show the oneroid states, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug addictions, how fragile are even in the wake of our internal image of external reality.
Any change in the state of consciousness, says psychologist Kasten, "may lead to the deformation of what we say is reality."
A reality that can also be enriching.
Snow can come
Burda
In 27 are to take over the burden of children
The new truck driver Kallen is a transitional solution: For a long time Hubert Burd wants to transfer his business to the hands of both children, said SPIEGEL.
Holding's supposed to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - Charger Hubert Burda sees his business for a long time in the hands of his children.
Both children will inherit at 27 years of age and have a strong will to enter the company, says 69-year-old man SPIEGEL.
We've dealt with the details carefully.
The question is, if they're also active in the company, it'll be up until then.
And the question is if they have the ability to do so.
It is not possible to put into charge 7,500 employees of their children if they are not able enough.
It would kill both the kids and the business.
The Burda announced on Thursday that he was coming from the Presidency of the Representation since January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of a representation at Burdy since 1999.
First, he was worried about technology.
Later, with the cut of Poładna, she added responsibility for the company's property and after Jürgen Todenhöfer's resignation also direct marketing, Cizina, Press and Finance.
For the first time, none of the family members are in charge.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Callen's appointment also serves to "exceed 10, 15 years," Burd said.
Holding should have 100 percent of the family in the future, says Burda.
In the light of the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that no family businesses had any assurance before the collapse: "It was always for companies who were allowed to get into a desire for capital that they speculated about and thought they could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had dreams of world power, says Burd.
I don't feel like the political receiver of this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play the world league with "Time", these stores are too big.

Miscellaneous Scores
Christmas is getting closer, and it's a time to find out what celebrities are wearing, and to adapt to it and to their celebrating dress.
The face of the cut is very important to highlight the figure, which is necessary to be aware.
Let's put in a couple of proposals.
Fergie's singer chose an extravagance and a very complicated cut.
Endesa in Barcelona, with electric car
The energy company Endesa, together with the Barcelona Council, founded the 'Live Office'.
It is a project for the development and promotion of electric cars in the capital of Catalonia.
The LIVE' office (Logistics for the introduction of electric cars) will establish and manage a roadmap for the introduction of electric cars in the city and secure agreements in the area of mobility, will set up, coordinate and submit grants, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric cars, collect opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the aim is to support this means of transport for the future.
3 'Electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city involved in the project of introducing electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville will join the project as well.
These are three cities that have chosen the government under the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric cars.
The energy company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The aim is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan Autonomous Region.
This includes energy-related activities and, above all, energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative with the participation of Endesy, as regards the promotion of electric cars.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and actively carries out a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a quiet period in the automotive industry.
The president of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the main export sector of the state, is waiting for the "peace period".
In the economic report of the President of the Government for 2009 Zapatero took stock of the measures taken during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Competition Plan for the automotive sector, we would now be faced with the status of abandonment, closure of some of our main manufacturing companies," said the president of the government.
"Thanks to this plan and the wish to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of peace in this industry, which is our main export sector, is foreseen in the future," he said.
In this regard, he argued that the competitive plan, which forms part of the Integrated Roadmap (IPA), has set 800 million for projects by 19 producers and 137 aid firms that mobilised investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The president explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernisation of production and current processes.
Zapatero also stressed government measures to support the demand and mentioned the 2000E plan, which applies in cooperation with autonomous areas and car brands.
According to the President, this plan has reduced the average emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by 6% and provided "significant increase" of the records, specifically in November of "40%".
20.000 square metres of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first International Classic Vehicle Salon will be opened, which is a space for meeting professionals and amateurs from the world of motors.
This initiative will take place on 5-7 February 2010 at the Madrid Casa de Campo Glass pavilion.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres, to which more than 200 foreign and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid will also be products of all kinds related to the world of motors.
The exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classical motors, real ladders for collectors and explorers.
The following will be included among the participating companies:Classicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, repair; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and repair; or Cochera Classics, a specialized company Mercedes Benz.
Exterior capacity tests
In addition, the commercial activity of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: concerting, sports performances, exams, presentations and competitions.
Tests will also be carried out on the capability of classic cars and motorcycles in a custom circle outside the exhibition area.
Mazda3 i-Stop: maintain sports style
The school intends to show that environmental research has no negative impact on the sport style.
And that's why Mazda3 has a built-in engine stop and start system - also baptized as a stop-, which is a device that is currently only available with a petrol engine 2.0 150 horses.
This second generationMazda3 is characterized by good characteristics that have been achieved as a whole.
Surface adjustment, vehicle implementation, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-stop system...
All these aspects are excellent at Mazda3.
The front seats, including the driver’s seats, have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The caller is also extremely nice.
With the help of tools and consoles, we conclude that Mazda continues to develop a Japanese trend in developing a futuristic design with many buttons and controls and a clear red and blue color.
This style reminds us partly of the style that also presents Honda Civic.
So we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, are contrasting with the sharpness of German products and specifically more sVolkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to defeat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, we need to mention a large storage space and regular forms.
The automatic stop and start-up engine system is currently available only with a petrol engine of two litres and 150 horsepowers with an axle-hand transmission.
This engine is a real lighthouse. It is very soft, marked by a reduced level of noise, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most desired Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not find so many kilometres a year should not exclude this i-stop with a petrol engine, because it is more comfortable when driving and reducing consumption.
As for equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sports and includes a larger number of serial elements.
In the series equipment it is necessary to mention, in particular, a system of monitoring of the driving pathways (RVM), which prevents the formation of the dead angle, control of the belt and stability, control of the speed, internal light-sensitive mirror, large-screen computer, parking tools, individual air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and a wheel from 17pall.
And if the equipment is not sufficient, this version was equippedPack Premium, for the supplement of 1,500 euros: adaptable two-axon and sound system BOSE with CD holder, except for other components.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its category.
It shall specify the quality of the materials used, its operation and the high level of equipment.
And in addition, people who don't find more miles per year can choose this version of i-Stop, which is only with a petrol engine2.0 and 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which makes €21.770 in the implementation of Luxury and €23.270 in the tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price, Mazda3 offers us a great deal of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Première'
L. A. has a red blanket, soft as the hands of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.

Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose dark 'lady'.
Slib PhonePeek
Peek is extremely limited, serves only for viewing mail, without being able to view a certain type of attachments or surfing the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States when his Time magazine assessed it as one of the products of the year.
Seeing her outside is harder, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is very low in price and monthly payments, less than half of the amount that applies, for example, to the iPhone data plan.
After her success, the company started offering two new facilities: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the other on the basis of a long-term free data service, but it is necessary to pay for a six-digit amount for Peek.
FonPeek, who was represented yesterday at the Le Web event, is a European version of the invention and at the same time its third change.
He's just as limited as his American counterpart, but he's bringing surprises.
The monthly maintenance price is about 12 euros a month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
Traveling people with a smartphone already know what it means to get data services after crossing borders or to look impatiently for a coffee shop with WiFi (such as Fon connection) so they can watch mail.
The Roma attack at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced long ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but according to my experience, a person would need a doctorate from physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to be able to read a miniature letter.
The European Commission is constantly demanding that roaming rates be reduced so that they are accessible to the whole of Europe, which still has no cost-effective effects.
There is a basic concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (is interesting that he still has a name Fon if he does not have WiFi) is enough for this type of tariff, means that operators start to think differently and consider various offers that would compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another fine example, offering download of books and other searches on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and payable on purchase, not after months.
And that's exactly what I expect it to happen once in the case of FonPeek, it's about the possibility of buying with a permanent approach like Peek has already been introduced in the United States.
Not because I'd like to buy it.
I'm checking my phone mail, thank you.
I expect it because I think it's from the consumer's point of view the best type.
It would be interesting if the tennis system could also be used in the computer.
Color that Michelle worships
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first lady in the United States.
For Barack Obama's return to the U.S. president's office, she chose the dress and coat in this color, and she also chose the same color when she accompanied her at the second most important moment in her life: giving the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: except that it is a similar color - yellow with three-dimensional effects - in both cases it was a classic set - dress, bag and coat of the same substance - decorated with a large height or a spoon.
At first glance it seemed that the first lady in the United States decided to go in the footsteps of the Austrian princess and wear similar clothing.
The fabric of which the clothing is made makes both models significantly different.
On the occasion of the entrance to Michelle's office, she used a large corner, in Oslo with a printing press.
Change and additions: green boots with medium high heels, a similar model, but in gold.
It also carries various features: this timerdole, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have work problems related to maternity.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially among women of young age who intend to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'Purity and career of Spanish women' carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute of Women.
The study took part in 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 years and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited employment opportunities due to maternity.
The study stresses that at the beginning of the partnership, there are many differences in views on the number of children depending on whether they work or not, and also on the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or have no stable jobs, start living with a partner before the first child is born and have more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, partnering and maternity leave, and have fewer descendants.
"Women aged 35 to 49 have the first child on average 3.7 years from the start of a marriage with a partner. This figure makes 4.1 in the case of women who have attained their stable employment most of their lives and therefore had to postpone partner marriage and children's income.
The type of call also has a strong influence on maternity, although it has a smaller influence on the time of initiation of a partner," explains Margarita Delgado, who is dedicated to research in CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of the marriage of the offspring is the degree of education.
The research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age when women marry and have their first child.
The differences are also between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group between 35 and 49, women with basic and higher education gave birth to their first child at 25.1 p.m.
"There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with basic education marry and give birth to the first child before finding a stable job, while women with secondary or higher education do otherwise prefer to obtain a stable job before the marriage is closed and the first child is born," Delgado says.
Diane Kruger's worth it, too.
L'Oréal Paris just added a new name to its prestigious list of performers: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will face various products of this brand under the universal password 'Cause I'm behind it'.
The performer 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most unlegitimate actors at international level, is thus added to another famous personalitiesL'Oréal Paris as for example Linda Evangelist, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Even before her, she joined this chosen actress Evangeline Lilly ('Dead') and Freida Pinto ('Millionaire of the Chat').
The Pansk part of this cosmetic brand is also represented by significant personalities:Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelical's partner in the Lost).
British fashion prices
The British have a lot to talk about in fashion.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, earlier and now - met at the annual price transfer that took place in London at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one missed the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen the best model of the year.
Poker Manuela Vicenta
Manuel Vicent presents thirty X-rays of writers in 'Esový poker' (Alfaguara, Fernando Vicente's illustration), with whom he met in his literary life (and in some cases in his normal life).
He does not do so in frightened and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but he is looking for something similar to the core of creative personalities.
The road brings excitement, and Vincent doesn't care about the benefits or the inspiration.
This book is an excellent reading benefit, even in repeated reading.
Here's some surveillance.
About Albert Camus: "On the pages of this book, I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but it cannot be termed: the benefit of prejudice, morale without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and never by intellect, something between powerlessness and ignorance, with blinding poetic humor, without meaning as if it were a rope that almost killed her."
About Graham Green: "Our man has been passionate about this woman for the past thirteen years, for the joys, for the joys and for the adventures, which is the spiritual destiny for the achievement of heaven by the way of destruction."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssey issued in Paris in 1922 Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight-dimensional peaks in universal literature, which must be overcome from the north, from which the best horocescs are often created."
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
He said to himself, "He's the heir of the county captain, and then he's the son of a black man with a crocodile."
In both cases, it was a great dream."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught on the bridge this man's mad scream from the Mnich in order to bring his message to the night of the 20th century in his literary form, running ahead of himself and calling to the future and speaking straight to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One of them knelt and prayed, 'God my beloved, make me stop writing as a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave, Spenser's verse was pronounced: 'After effort the dream comes,/by the storm a quiet port,/by the war of rest,/by the life of death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "He also took his depression into his pockets.
His husband fully agreed to tell him that Edward VII was watching her between the azals or that the birds were singing Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness."
About Pio Baroja: "What else did Martin Santos do than focus Joyce on Baroje?
What else was Benette going to do than let Baroness fix Faulkner's weapon?
What else was the purpose of making himself famous for the glory of that man?"
Saved Aggression
Last week, my seven-year-old mother passed through our quarter, during Fuenlabrad, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed by the knee and our dog, a cross saved from a weight of not more than six kilograms, without a single word, and badly injured her twice.
Our enthusiasm is that we do not see anything fun in such aggression against a small and defenseless animal that was also on the water.
And to that effect, the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she went through with these individuals, began to worry about her own safety, because such a demon possessed person who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, to a child, to an old man or to anyone who is weaker than he himself.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, on Tuesday, in the usual quiet neighborhood.
The dog's been crying all day.
Of course, we have complained about the closest Commission, but we doubt that it was something and that, in order not to raise the horrendous questions, we find that these saved murderers were Spanish nationals.
The excitement led us to announce this fact.
We don't understand what's going on with today's youth when he's having trouble with a defenseless animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We don't understand where the right education was divided, respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helmet
The manufacturer of Michelin tyres, in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to support the use of helmets, especially among younger motorists, as both of these operators have reported today.
The aim of this initiative is to highlight the importance of using helms because it is the only means to prevent head injury and death in the event of an accident when driving a motorcycle.
Michelin states that this campaign is part of their transport safety commitments, which "means more than to propose and produce even more safe products", and confirmed that it is trying to fulfil this purpose, in other words, in the form of instructional and information campaigns.
This new campaign to support the use of helmets when driving on a motorcycle, under the password 'To be or not to be', is the first phase when more than 500 repair motorcycles will be deployed to get to the widest public awareness.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that transport safety "is a constant problem" of this company, which is a manufacturer of dual-wheel tyres and whose main objective is to continuously increase product safety.
Increased sales of light commercial vehicles
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to resonate.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain accounted for an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, the first increase after 22 months of permanent decline, according to the figures of the parent organisation of Anfac and Ganvam producers.
However, the positive data is better put into quarantine, as November 2008 is a very bad comparison period and meant 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rise in the last month, the total number of registered vehicles in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous accounting year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles belonging to the category of light commercial vehicles: passenger cars, pick-ups, deliveries, smaller trucks and light trucks/trailers.
And there were no clouds that hurt demand the most, even though they were purchased by private individuals, most of the purchases were made by smaller and medium-sized companies and nearly 100% of the cases are financing through third parties.
Other factors such as stopping or continuing the bad economic situation should also be added to the restriction resulting from the closure of the source of bank loans.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, the purchase support 2000E did not help too much.
In addition to private individuals, it is necessary to mention the companies operating on the feeder list of small and medium-sized enterprises that intend to buy a light-duty vehicle up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 level of not more than 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday from Ganvam again reminded us that special attention should be paid to the management of these vehicles and industrial vehicles (stones and buses).
The association of sellers assumes that in 2010 development will be similar to last year and according to the estimates of sales in passenger cars and 4x4 will decrease by 19%.
The auxiliary hand brake system is already mandatory equipment.
As in the case of the ABS anti-lock system, this will also be done with the management of the stability of the ESP, auxiliary hand brake systems, all of which will become mandatory equipment for European vehicles.
In fact, it is already part of the compulsory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light-duty vehicles, while the others set a deadline for the removal of the shortage, which is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU aim to increase the protection of pedestrians, which works so that it can help prevent many hits.
The auxiliary hand brake system increases the brake pressure in the event of an emergency, which the system will detect after the driver turns off.
But he can't always keep this pressure to the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of the Bosch automotive parts, a third of the drivers with an accident did not send a brake before the impact and half of them did not fully use the brake force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires the maximum braking system and reduces the vehicle's braking distance.
According to a study carried out in the EU alone, if all vehicles were fitted with this type of device, up to 1 100 fatal accidents per year could be avoided.
The reduction of this number will be even more significant-by-calculations would prevent one of four accidents with an impact on persons-after the introduction of so-called intelligent hand brake systems.
In this case, vehicles will be equipped with a system that (by radar or cameras) captures the obstacles and reports them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help him increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not react, even if the impactor cannot be prevented, the device shall act as intensifier on the brake and reduce the risk of damage to the minimum.
General Motors sets up a plan for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, to Opel employees in Figueruelas (Zaragoza), that the production of new Meriva will start in the first week of April - probably 8 April - as Javier Ortega informed, the American producer pointed out that it would take more time to complete the renewal plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to ensure that each point of the plan is first agreed with the party concerned.
As a result, the final document, which will first be submitted to the employees and then to the government of the individual countries in which the production plant is located, may be issued at the beginning of 2010.
On the contrary, the GM ensures that Saab’s sale decision should be taken on these days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has raised pressure on the US producer to make certain decisions as soon as possible.
GM provides contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wants to get Volvo, but considers the possibility of a Dutch manufacturer of Skype sports cars acting under the protection of the Russian Converg Group.
In case it is not possible to agree with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab’s Chinese assets to Baic.
It is still valid to decide to close at the end of the year Saab unless its sale is successful.
Riding with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In developing this excellent model, the engineers from Porsche used Boxster S as the basis and managed to reduce their weight by 80 kg, thus showing only 1.275 kg.
On the basis of the first line, the automatic charging roof was in payment with manual control, which was reduced by 21 kg; the aluminium door was further used, e.g. GT3, which means another 15 kg less; the removal of air conditioning, 13; the reduction of fuel supply from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to the reduction of the weight by another 7 kg; after the installation of the sports seats of another 12 kg, due to the length of the 19pal wheel five kg.
Finally, the removal of the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less and the replacement of door arrests with textile capture means another kilogram.
It is also offered with a dual transmission PDK, one vehicle with a hand-held six-speed cabinet was tested, mainly on the second-class roads in California, on the mountain sections with many complex plots.
His conduct can only be qualified as untraceable.
The weight reduction does not mean that the vehicle to the asphalt is not printed.
On the contrary, we have not tested for so long a small and lightweight model that would also convey such security when moving in the race, even at high speeds.
It's a little athlete able to heat muscles in a short drive after a necessary time until we order him to drive, brake, and re-use the engine...
Whatever we want, thanks to the management that's as communicative as accurate, whatever we're pointing with our hands on the wheel, that's what the car's doing.
And he'll do it with surgical accuracy.
Engine sound according to will
The V6 boxer sound, about 320 horses (about 10 more than Boxster S) is very powerful and it is possible to enhance it with the possibility of 'sport' and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine that was already used in Panama.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether during sowing or recovery.
The locks are solid, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we're going through with Boxster Spyder was pretty ruined, but the car got a good job.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride, and at the same time, in some races, we were able to light up the freezing and snowflake even in the early morning.
Definitely this ultralight car is one of the most fun on the market, as it's about something more than just modifying Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010 at €70,831.

Basconia won the victory in Israel
The job was awarded a brilliant victory in 82-91 at its complex Maccabi Electra venue, despite numerous absences in the Duska Ivanovice Association, and this led to its group's great performance Mirzy Teletovice, which with eight triple points was the best performance in the company (29 ratings).
Vitorie succeeded in replacing the significant absence of Herrmann, Olesona, Huertase or Mic's with a large dose of placement and collective work, although it had to suffer to the end to win.
In addition, the high precision of the circle with 16 triple points was greatly involved in the final triumph.
The attack began in front of the blues who had been put on the mark from the beginning.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance, already indicating that they attacked the Israelite society very hard.
English and Teletovic belonged between the main shooter 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Albanian company decided for the internal game Baraca and the work of Elijah, which was accepted by sand and dust upon return to its original place of business to increase the benefit before the break began (34-43).
Teletovic has already started to appear as the best in his 13th-point association, although 'without the sixth' in Splitter' assessment has already indicated that it will not be the best evening for Brazil.
But although the match was sharp until the break, it was not decided in the least and the Maccabees wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone wins on their games, and 'Elíase' by hand' managed to win.
Eidson and Pnini have certainly contributed to the return to the launch (50-49).
More inappropriate
The Ivanovic members, the injury, but not dead at all, needed a number of precise games to take the breath, and then came the Mirza Teletovic tower, which with the help of English and Ribase returned to the soothing number (54-67), which reached the locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Alashti sedated the skin in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow someone to prepare them for the deserved results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their ability, did not give up and tried to keep the company alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this and with Splitter excluded for the Fault of SeIvanovic, they did not hire and defend well, and while the Israelites approached the final minute (80-85), the game had already won and Tel Aviv lost first in the season.
The injury makes it impossible for Unica to fight
Unicajo lost significantly in Greece with Olympiacos and left the lead of Group B to Eurolise in a battle marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but above all the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which made Greek victory easier.
The company of Malagasy did not dwell in Pavilion's peace and friendship, perhaps one of the sick in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to sleep. Aggressive defense and three-thirds of their own, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubia, sparkled the game with 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicija , although the local arsenal in the internal game with Bourousis, Vujcice and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, a minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between the rebels from USABeverley and Williams meant the exclusion of both players.
Greek society began to function and demonstrated its superiority in both areas where the absence of an English beer due to the injury of Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez made it difficult for the union of Unicija
Between the internal players and the Lithuanian wing of Linas Kleizas with three points increased the advantage to 44-32, minutes 19.
Absence
The third part was very influential on the part of Olympiacos, who, despite his loss of 19 years old, showed consideration and even managed to balance the difference from the struggle in Malaga, 66-48, a minute 27 that he lost control in the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and the last absence of Scottish beer Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
In spite of all the disadvantages of Unika's leadership and three points of Cook and the benefit of Levise left a certain hope n winning 66-57, minutes 31.
But it was practically impossible, because Olympiacos was able to prove that it was unstoppable due to the reinforcement and overpowering in centimeters in his area.
Croatia's brewer Nikola Vujcic, managed to balance basket vertage 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja took the lead in Olympiacos.

During the week, what the application works, the searcher found that the Spanish worker generally felt "badly rewarded", explained in his report Albert Rivera responsible for Trovit.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
The British programmer takes 45.226 euros of rough annually and French 31.059, while Spain receives 24,000.
The driver also has 34.247 euros per year in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 in Spain.

Brazil sets Zelay's date of departure
The Brazilian government set a deadline for the overthrow of Manuel Zelayi at its embassy in Tegucigalpe.
The President-in-Office must leave the diplomatic mission by 27 January 2010 at the latest, when his mandate is officially completed.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in Honduras City, confirmed for TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy where he is hiding since September 21.
"It is known that on January 27th, after the end of his mandate, he must leave and search for another place of refuge."
The station also quoted an ex-citizen who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline stated: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the protection of the Brazilian government," Zelaya telephoned.
After the elections on November 29th (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya made sure that it would be held in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, for a week, he tried to find refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally collapsed because Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum, which he was trying to impose on the "de facto" government, which President Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After days of wine and roses from the past spring, when inflation was the dominant mood in the markets, uncertainty reappeared in the markets, which should not be surprising, because it is already a natural state in the environment where the actors make decisions about the future that do not exist for themselves.
The drug used by central banks to stabilise the market was debt relief by direct acquisition of assets and indirect liquidation of liquidity in the course of close zero so that financial institutions could purchase assets to the off-balance sheet.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have practically ended, and without doubt their irregular liquidity policy, they are starting to throw a little sand into conflict, as the Spanish Central Bank has done with its auction last year.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we will participate in the return of the reduction of risk.
The pace of the storms and the differences in the debt companies have again gained points, although they are still very far away from the abnormal level they achieved at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialise their private risks, which again affected public debt.
Once again, the pressure on quality and the USA, Japan and Germany have become a shelter for selected investors, thus widening the differentiation of the eurozone countries towards Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this instability, but at the time Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of the Spanish Kingdom's qualifications.
On the other hand, certain uncertainty is not useless for the silence of moral risk agents who have once again tried to burden the consciences of those responsible for world economic policy to speed up the damaging consequences of limiting credit to employment when a new day of gratitude should actually be announced.
However, the situation in Dubai represents the tribal struggles between the emigration of power recovery in emirates, and as for Greece, we have seen it before.
A government that covers the deficit, elections and the new government is taking place.
Prodi did this in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow the euro Member States not to fulfil their commitments.
What is logical, however, is that Ecofin would make the Greek government transparent and committed its own citizens to shared responsibility in the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are before the transitional risk premium normalisation period, after some excess positions in supported positions would be within the expected period.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase as well as the bonds of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If European differences are reduced and our situation continues to widen, this would be a typical Spanish risk.
The importance of Standard & Poor's is only an anecdotes. When our leading indicators force most of the services to pass over their recovery scenarios and review their recovery scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission to return to the Japanese scenario, the Spanish economy does not know the great hope of experiencing the fulfillment of this warning.
Again, it seems to be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the time being, "carefully, friend drivers".

President Iberdola Ignacio Sánchez Galán, as the first yesterday, intervened before the sub-committee of MPs, where the energy strategy of Spain is discussed in these days over the next two decades.
After his intervention, followed by the speech of President Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villasecy, Galán submitted several comments on the proposal submitted by the sub-committee at the closed door.
According to President Iberdrol Spain, the investment of EUR 50,000 million by 2020 and another EUR 60,000 million from this date by 2030 is needed if nuclear power plants that are currently in operation are maintained.
If this does not happen, the necessary investments will not be 60,000 million but up to 95,000 million.
Iberdrola really believes that in the next decade investments need to focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international connections.
Since 2020, the issue is changing and will need to be increased.
His offer focuses on gas and coal plants with carbon capture mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this case, it is believed that there is a need for a new 18 000 MW, namely with other "supporting energies".
Galán, who is of the opinion, is a woman of the law on sustainable economy, which has just approved by the government, is in line with the line that the company demanded, did not want to leave the living as a royal decree to support the consumption of national coal, which opposes the policy of combating climate change.
In his view, "clear long-term commitment" is in this sense, despite "precise" measures, as President Iberdrol called them.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that the investment decision, although long-term, must start to take place now, because their maturity is ongoing and a stable tax framework is necessary for their initiation.
Ferrovial won 'action' Aer Lingus on ten airports
The daughter of Ferrovial for airport services, Swissport, will play the role of Irish airline airline Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are the most important of them.
The agreement from which the economic deadlines have not yet expired shall be valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Kastilie-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol on cooperation in the creation of the Centre for the Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructure
The association is expected to invest 20 million by 2012, 50% of which belongs to Ferrovial.
One of the objectives of the Centre will be to explore energy efficiency on the roads and airports.
Action seeks its first road in Australia against Hochtifif and Bouygues
The action fights for its first concession on the road in Australia, which is the market where it is already working as an energy and water business.
The building is estimated at 1,700 million Australian dollars (approximately 1,047 million euros).
Its competitors are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtif.
The tunnel 5 kilometers long in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast has become the closest opportunity for Actiona to be established in this country as a construction and concession road company.
The workshop wants to have a tunnel completed at the end of 2014
Following the selection of public-private cooperation (PPP according to initial in English) for further development of the project in the business plan protected by Erns & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the construction and operation of the mine.
The tenders are expected to be submitted in May and the expected investment will reach 1,700 million Australian dollars (1,047 million euros) and, in the final phase, three groups with significant presence in European buildings.
A group called Transcity leads Actiona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, and the second is based in Italy as one of the largest European construction specialists.
Against the Actiona group is the Northern Direct group with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French building group Bouygues.
The third and last group, which has passed through the network, has the name LBRJV and is divided into the Australian capital Lighton (subsidiary of the construction company Hochtifif, here represented ACS), as well as the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and a prominent company specializing in civil buildings in Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large buildings and privatization, but it carries a clear difficulty to enter otherwise than through the acquisition of a local construction company.
In addition to the Asian references, the strategy which was guided by Hochtifif or Bilfinger is still an example for Spanish giants in the sector.
The ACS received a position on the market through its 30 % share in Hochtifif, the owner of the quoted Lighton company.
Million assets
The action is based on a geographical area with the greatest importance for the sector in which it already has a significant presence through its energy supplier activities and in the disposal trade.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and runs a group of companies that build and repair the rescue facility in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use common energy to enter the construction and infrastructure areas.
The underground road, which is the proponent of the Brisbane Infrastructure Authority, with the name Northern Link, is to connect the western road from Toowong to the district route in Kelvin Grove (see map) within 5 km of the tunnel. It is the biggest action to reduce Brisbane traffic congestion.
The calendar established by the local administration is planning the tasks for 2010 and the start of work for December next year.
Although this pay pass would be open in the last months of 2014, the complete completion of the work is planned until 2016.
The tunnel began to design in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic myth and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its financing.
Brisbane already offered this contract Hochtifif
Australia still brings significant profits to Hochtifif because it announced yesterday a government agreement estimated at 154 million.
The ACS is operated through its Lighton national network infrastructure, with an optical fibre cable, via its local branches.
This situation enables fast access to the Internet for 400,000 people and provides the work of the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the King George tower building project on 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work should only start and Hochtief closed the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, she will participate with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC has been allocated a 64 million-dollar tunnel in Slovenia
FCC, through its Alpine branch, has received the construction of a tunnel of 2.1 km long for the highway in Slovenia worth EUR 64,5 million.
The company received a contract a few days after working to expand the tunnel in Bosruck, Austria, by 130 million.
This way, the Alpine reinforces its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the work is planned at the beginning of 2010 and the period for implementation is 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore got a commercial at Renfe
Renfe has provided advertising and marketing services for the last two years by Ms. Rushmore for about three million euros a year, the railway company informed.
The contract contains the possibility of extending 12 months each year. Ms. Rushmore was selected among the 16 agencies that presented themselves in the competition published by Renfe, of which four were posted to the final, among them TBWA, who was responsible for the creation of advertising for the last three years.
From this moment on, Mrs. Rushmore will take care of the design and production of the campaign.
Pukuta 63 million proFrance Telecom for the braking of competition
The French competition regulatory authority imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on lFrance Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to this institution, the operator restricted the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programmes with consumers on the border of the regulation.
The French monopoly and the state company have still purchased more than €560 million since 1994 in order to create obstacles to its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased, because the competition authority considers France Télécom to have committed a similar offence as in the past, and therefore it has been rescinded.
Trade in applications
On the other hand, a mobile branch of the French company is still a star among other operators and has opened a shop with internet applications to increase revenues that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the beginning, trade with Orange applications will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for entry into other countries such as Spain.
The game in the league Champions has brought 476.4 million Madrid and Barche from the beginning
The Masters League has become a source of revenue for these clubs since its creation in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned 476.4 million since then, which makes the third and fifth most profitable club in competition.
The list reads Manchester United.
The list reads Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Masters League does not only bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of revenue for large clubs.
To the extent that the competition divided EUR 5,362.5 million between 105 companies (of which 12 Spanish) who participated in this action since the 1992/1993 season tournament, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have come out of this division very well.
The white club was the third on the continent with the most money he got to participate, and the only one with AC Milan who won three times the main prize.
The Catalan current champion and the last winner of the missing European Cup in 1992 is in the fifth grade.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich Bayern, two associations that also counted the most money to participate in the previous League of Masters.
And even though she lost both of them with Barç.
On the other hand, Spain is the third country that received the most money through the Champions, although it received the most titles from all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This obvious paradox is explained by a complex procedure in the allocation of the money used by UEFA.
For this financial year, Michel Platini's body is expected to earn 1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of these, UEFA spends 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that took part in the previous classification round (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, the participants received 3.8 million only for their presence, with the exception of another 550,000 euros for each match they participate in.
There are also prizes for winning (800,000 euros) and remistration (400,000 for each company). Osmiffinalists get three million each; eight quarter-finalists 3.3 million.
Each of the last four will get 4 million.
The champion will make nine million, while the second finalist is 5.2 million.
This is how the club earns at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million on fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for victory in the European Superintendent in August.
In addition, there are mobile payments, which amount to 337,8 million.
This money is divided according to the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the principals and has four designated seats.
Last year's champion gets 40% of the allocated money, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches played this year.
New Rumasa offers 61m euros for 29.9% Sos
The New Rumas group yesterday published details of the offer of buying shares, with which it wants to gain a top position between 25% and29.9% of Sos capital.
This percentage does not involve making a public offer for the acquisition (optional) of all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 for the share it would pay in ten years and for which it would pay the interest for this deposit 1% annually.
Yesterday the Sos shares ended trading at 1.85 euros; therefore, the New Rumas offer of a company rating of 18% below the market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euro reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer shall be conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Council.
The Jerez group provides a period of 15 days to notify shareholders of their interest in selling the stock.
CNMV declared that it was not informed of the offer, although Ruize Mateose confirmed that it had joined the regulatory authority.
If the purchase was made, the price would be 611.7 million, while Sos' capitalisation is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, the sauce continues to change the structure of its management.
As an attempt to disrupt the possible bids on the border to buy and settle the trials of his former leaders, the brothers of Jesús and Jaime Salazars, the election of Marie Luisy Jord was announced as the head of the internal audit.
This decision is made by the first woman to hold a high office in the food business.
It's a newly created place that will be subject to the president of the group.
And it is not exempt from the controversy, as the company is still humiliated in the legal battle of a alleged move of more than 230 million from the Sos company of the Salazar brothers.
De facto it cannot be denied that in the coming months Sos will discover new transfers of funds
With regard to Salazars' credit yesterday, the former members of the National Court of Justice Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) confirmed that they approved the translation of 212 million without knowing where they were located.
CNMV allows the option to exclude the Paterna who participated in Inversora Mer
Yesterday, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) approved an exemption from the participation of Investor Mer to Federica Patrin on 9 October.
The Supervisory Authority has explained that it authorises this operation, since it understands that its conditions are in conformity with the applicable standards, and considers that the "sufficient" content of the brochures submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December is considered to be "sufficient".
CNMV clarified that the offer is aimed at acquiring 550.008 shares of Federica Paternine at 7.65 euros for shares, representing 8.95% of the company's capital, which is made up of 6,142,786 shares accepted for stock exchanges in Madrid and Bilbao.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares were neglected, which could not be transferred in any way until the offer was closed, which it specified that the price was determined by the Federice Paternin in accordance with the provisions of the rules in force.
New tools for car assessment
In these days, storms and accidents make not only car services.
Each day, thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance event are dragged to a service where a knowledgeer must estimate the damage and the cost of repair.
No insurance event is the same and the calculation of the cost of parts and time of the labour force may be long and difficult work.
Manually calculate the cost of repairing from 20,000 to 30,000 euros including parts and working force can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
For this reason, almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Suppliers of services and solutions for the assessment of insurance events and maintenance shall be responsible for collecting information provided to them by manufacturers to develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex is a leading company from the American Solar Group; 80% of the evaluation is carried out with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of instruments for assessing and processing information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the producers is not easy at all.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, CEO of Audatex, they work in Spain with 63 producers and importers and each of them provides information in a different format.
In addition, the number of data to be processed is still growing, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been mentioned in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
Once the new vehicle enters the market, these companies will start working.
It's a very hot job because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and set its price.
In addition, "intelligent" graphic processing is carried out in each model, where it is possible to "oppose" individual parts of tourist vehicles.
As far as the model with mass sales is concerned, work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
In the case of a minority car, it may take three or four months. At present, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models they have are Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the driving park in circulation, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and database processing, Audatex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanical experts) working at the same time with three computer monitors.
Auditex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Every month 2.5 million data are classified, and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this immeasurable flow of information enables businesses to make different use and provision of different products.
The most common use is focussed on repair and maintenance, but according to individual countries, there are also tools to manage spare parts or to calculate the sales or residual value of the car.
Eurotax is the only company that has a guide who informs about the value of vehicles used in Spain.
Audatex doesn't offer them in our country, but in the United States, yes.
With a view to the products offered by Auditex, it is easy to get the support that professionals can use in the sector.
This company offers ten different instruments, with AudaPlus as a star product, the standard solution for assessing the insurance events intended for the know-how.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it shall also include the time for repair estimated by the manufacturer or by-products.
This instrument shall be applied as applicable for each assessment.
The highest price is 5.75 euros for customers who use it less, up to 10 times a month.
Then every insurance company that carries out thousands of estimates will negotiate its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow the complete identification of the vehicle and the device with which it came from the assembly line only on the basis of the first number of the vehicle.
AudaGlass concentrates on vehicle glass and AudaSubbastas is an open service for the professional sector on the Internet, which allows to dispose of vehicles with a total insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analysis or finding deviations according to brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many model brands have been serviced for the reason of the accident or how many have suffered serious insurance events for certain periods.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to developing this type of tool.
For example, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also intended for customers and also provides digital images, access to works or prices and official time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of Einsa based in 1971 as a supplier of services and solution to the damage, accident or car maintenance assessment
Gt Guia evaluation is her reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in services, 3,100 acquaintances and 53 insurance rooms.
The volume of turnover has increased by 20% per year for the last three years, accounting for 10.8 million euros in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization of the installation office in Paris began.
Audetex was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources 62% of her brother is born in Europe and 38% in North and South America. She works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
The global invoice of the Solar Group (Audex, Sidex, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company earns 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group stood at the stock exchange of $1,000 million and now its shares are estimated at the total value of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been listed at the New York Stock Exchange and included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auction of unmanned vehicles
Last October, the Solera Group bought Autoonline, an internet base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance event.
The operation assumed a subscription of EUR 59.5 million from 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended by the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of the purchase was to provide more services with added value to customers with access to the vast international market.
This valuation and purchase and sale service is exclusively provided to professionals in the sector such as insurance, knowledge, credit, services, sales of spare parts and professional sellers who have to register before the start of the operation.
This platform was set up in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
The main markets include Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The web currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 customers.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and adds about 100 new ads to the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish law, the car number of which has been removed cannot be returned to service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with historical value may be allowed to operate, even if they have been cut off, after the preliminary procedure.
Budget of the service in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audetex ensures that the user receives a budget only in four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for spare parts, creation of the budget generation budget.
The ease of use is a fundamental condition for these systems, especially for the conviction of professionals of a higher age who are more or less sustainable in the use of new techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, including tourist 666, 109 terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 deliveries and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer to connect to the Internet.
After identification of the model to be repaired, using the number of the trailer, a real graphic display of the model will appear and then the necessary replacement part will be selected.
The user may include variables as the price of the labour force, supplements or discounts, and then print and hand over to the customers.
AudaTaller is not a rating tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service-oriented and does not include labour estimates.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros a year, which the customer can finance.
At present, the Audetex company is working to make this view three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that the mechanics welcome, because it allows for, for example, choosing a door and turning it around to show the inside.
