28-year-old spring found dead in San Francisco supermarket
This week, a 28-year-old spring found in a magnificent staircase, recently moved to San Francisco .
But the brother of the sacrifice said that he could not imagine anyone who would do more than his brother, saying, "His life has finally begun to improve."
On Wednesday at the University of Westfield, a young man was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, a representative of the San Francisco Medical Expert Office.
The San Francisco police reported that his death was recognized as a murder and an investigation is under way.
Brother Luis Galicia told the San Francisco radio station ABC KGO that Frank had previously worked in Boston for a famine, but six months ago he stayed at his dream work restaurant "Sons & Daughters" San Francisco.
The "Sons & Daughters" representative of the restaurant informs that the news about his death shocked them and upset them.
"We are a small team working as a family and we are very short," said the representative.
At this difficult time, we think about being with Frank’s friends and family.
Luis Galicia says that at first, Frank was in the hostel, but in recent years, life has improved.
"He moved into the new apartment and met a girl," Luis tells the radio station KGO.
Luis Galicia claims that he does not know who would want to cross over his younger brother.
He was a good man with a wide heart.
"He's always fooled his family by making delicious meals and cooking lunch," said Luis Galicia
He never wanted to get involved in disputes.
He was the brother who adapted himself to others.
"In view of all the things that have passed away in the world, he was like an unworked diamond that looked almost every day," he says.
Anyone who has information about the event is invited to call the SFPD Information Phone 415-575-4444.
New doctor's strike: Call for new protests
The representatives of the new doctors ask their trade union to launch protests in the dispute over the new contract.
The British Medical Association (LMA) New Committee of Doctors (JAK) is preparing to request advice to support wider protests early in September.
The JAK considers that ministers have not been able to raise doubts about the contract.
In July, new doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by LMA.
The contract was voted against by 58 % of all the members who took part in the vote.
In a message published on Thursday evening on Twitter, JAK Council member Elena Makkorta points out that the government continues to remain silent on this issue and therefore the contract proposal has been rejected.
She said: "In the light of this, the proposal for a contract has been completely rejected by the JAK vote and a decision has been taken to request new formal negotiations to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the government's silence, the JAK today formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorize the development of new contracts to enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, the new doctors participated in six strikes, including the first time in the NHS’s history of stopping work.
Following the vote rejecting the terms of the agreement proposed by the LMA recommended by the BMA, the new doctor’s representative, Dr. Johan Malavana, withdrew from office.
Before meeting with 54 000 young doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and will be accepted.
After the vote, the Secretary of Health, Jeremiah Hunts, announced that the contract would be concluded with English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: Abstained Alliances?
A sadness that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to discuss and report on the eight-month term and the end of the economic sanctions war.
But thanks to Turkish leaders in St. Petersburg, Vladimir Putin felt that Ankara needed these partnerships more.
But both of them were shocked.
Vladimir Putin’s smile looked at the plot and did not cause warm emotions, even in view of his normal resistance.
On the other hand, the view of Tayjips Erdogan at least five times mentioned Putin as his " dear friend", a review of the news meeting.
I don't know how much.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve until the pre-crisis level, but become even stronger.
On the next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan acted as if nothing had happened.
I think her enthusiasm causes conflicting feelings.
But Putina’s glowing wind shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was to land the Russian plane on the Syrian border.
At the time, Moscow responded.
Putin accused Ankara of wearing a dance in Moscow’s back.
The transition was even more painful, given that it came from a friend.
It will be very difficult to regain true trust, perhaps even impossible.
Since November, Russia's public position has changed.
For several months, government-controlled television spread aggressive charges against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that all was Turkish.
The most serious accusation was that Erdogan’s own family had gained profits from the illegal oil trade with the Islamic State-controlled Syrian part.
Of course, he rejected it himself.
But St. Petersburg's main message is that the time has come to forget the past.
Finally, this meeting was only because Putin received President Erdogan's apology.
Russia could view it as its kind of victory.
The benefits of the Ankara Peace Agreement are obvious.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after a failed turn last month, where he tried to throw them away.
The countless terrorist attacks have also undermined his position.
There are also economic reasons.
Russian sanctions have caused substantial losses, in particular the ban on charter travel, which usually ensures the flow of several million Russian tourists to Turkey's resorts every year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies will also be relieved when regular flights are renewed.
They are looking forward to the holiday heat in the Mediterranean according to the season.
Already this week, national TV plans to reduce the prices of fruit and vegetables, as Turkey's imports of fruit and vegetables will be renewed.
As the local newspaper Vedemosti quotes: "Tourists for them, tomatoes for us."
However, the visit also had other political motives on the part of Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West about their weak response to a turnaround attempt.
There is also dissatisfaction with the long-term negotiations on EU and Putin's accession, which will benefit from the situation that Turkey has withdrawn from the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly obtained additional points in Ankara’s eyes, expressing his support for his elected government after the coup attempt.
Consider that Moscow understands this well, for it itself is deeply fueled by fear of change in the country of the regime.
The Samit, which took place in this narrow coastal castle, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as one analyst called it, the "refugee alliance", the two countries that feel isolated from the West, join forces.
However, despite the unity demonstrated publicly, there are still considerable differences in views between the two countries.
The main disagreements concern Syria, where Russia presents itself as a bearer of peace, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposite parties.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, not wanting to disclose information, both presidents announced at the press conference that they had not discussed this issue.
Turkey's President has targetedly avoided issues of disagreement between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on how both countries could find a common language on the issue of Syria.
After months, however, the situation has improved, as both leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The SME brand will continue to play a support role, announced by the Bank’s Executive Director.
Out of Scotland, SMEs will no longer be available.
Ross Makevans tells the BBC channel in Scotland that the SME brand was associated with bank ambitions on a global scale.
It has turned down these ambitions, as the bank was almost bankrupt eight years ago and needed financial assistance.
In the meantime, experts in the branding strategy have used the SME brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank received millions of awards from international sports sponsors, starting with the 6th National Regiment and ending with the Vimbldon tennis champion Andy Murey.
However, it is now decided to put other national brands in the foreground.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all SME references, outside the main office and official stock exchange list, will be replaced by the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Now there are also fewer private financial brands, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Makevan was interviewed during the trip with customers and employees on Invernessshire.
He told the BBC Scotland channel: "The SKB will become our investor brand and with which our employees work, because now we are becoming more a brand bank."
In time, the bank itself became a global brand and SMEs became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in its industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
SMEs have already announced that they will not continue sponsoring "Six Nations" and engage in various brands in sponsoring sport.
"Is it time to become a brand bank because we've asked ourselves a long time ago how to become a better bank for our customers?" says the Executive Director.
Three years ago it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
But thanks to hard work and focusing on customer needs, not on our own needs, we have evidently made major changes.
We can relive these brands, so I think it's the right time.
France Detori won the 3000th victory, winning first place in New York with horse Predication
Depots are rewinding the champagne by winning their 3000th victory twice in the first race in New York City.
On Friday, Frank Detori won his 3,000th victory in the history of Britain, gaining first place in New York City.
He achieved it by winning the second victory in these events that took place in his hometown, with the Predication trained by John Gosdens.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth gait that has achieved such results in horse racing.
He joined Ser Gordon Richard, Doug Smith, Lester Pigat, Peter Eder, and Willie Carson.
The three-way champion, Detori, who had won with the Ghayyar horse before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very moved because my family is here.
I am very happy that this happened in New York City because I have been living here for 30 years.
This is not a big deal, it's not the Royal Askot, but it's a regular Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After victory Detori and Predilection are expected with applause and forks.
Two jokes have been achieved in these record races with obstacles - champion Richard Johnson and the 20-time winner Ser Antonius Mackoy, who has installed several records in his career, winning more than 4300 victories.
Lester Pigots, the ninth winner, won 4493 in his career.
Frankie is one of the best jokes today, and there is no surprise that he has made a success that only rarely can achieve.
He is stylish and strong, but his tactics make him feel different from other blinds.
He is a fantastic actor, his enthusiasm and charm for years attracts fans of this kind of sport.
A few weeks ago, in Epsoma's matches, I told Franky that he had already won 6,000 victories if he didn't participate only in the weekends and the big competitions.
However, it is a real joy for France to have won regularly in the United Kingdom for 30 years.
He is a life - giving man who makes great use of British competitions, and he is an excellent geek.
Frank Detori noted this achievement with his company's mark - the flying destiny.
From the wind of completion to the flying crash, Frances Detori has been the face of British horse racing for 20 years.
This was an adventure full of ways.
He has won countless great competitions, including the famous "Great Seven" of 1996 in Ashkot, and has also experienced a plane crash and disqualification for the use of preparations.
Three years ago, it was difficult for him to return after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated his strength by challenging those who questioned him back in his best form.
And he could participate in the competitions for a while - Detori has said earlier that he would like to continue his participation in the competitions at least 50 years old.
Russian President Putins resigns the head of administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putins unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivanov, head of administration.
Ivanov had been in Putina’s closest circle for many years.
At present, 63-year-old politician has been appointed as a special representative in natural and transport matters.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin 'decided to exempt Ivanov from the duties of the head of the Russian President's administration', without mentioning the reason.
In place of Ivanova, Anton Vaino, who has been his deputy since 2012.
The 44-year-old Vaino has been beaten by a diplomat.
Vino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, who graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked in the Tokyo Embassy.
As sent to the Kremlin website (in Russian), he later led the management of the President's protocol and government staff.
After being appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my view, the main task of the administration is to support your work as the President of the State by drafting laws and controlling the implementation of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to quit his job and recommended Vaino as his substitute.
Does that make sense?
This step has raped Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov is a sense and close companion of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, worked in the Security Service of the Council.
In this capacity, he was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At a public television broadcast, both men announced Ivanov's resignation on his own initiative.
But in spite of the smiles directed at the cameras, which are rarely confirmed by such an explanation, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the outcome of the struggle for power?
Nobody knows that.
However, the official claim that a man who was considered a potential president suddenly wanted to become a leader of Russian environmental policy is perceived with great skepticism.
The comments published on the Kremlin website Ivanov says to Putin: "It is the fact that at the beginning of 2012 I ask you to entrust me with this difficult job, even to say, a problematic job, for four years.
It turns out I've worked in this office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Former Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the U.S. State Security Service, like Putins.
At the end of 1990, Putin led the Federal Security Service, who is a successor of the VDK, Ivanov received his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov among the five men he trusted most.
At the end of Putina's second term, Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for the Russian President, since Putina's transfer to the third term would be anti-constitutional.
At that time, however, the president became another close companion of Putina - Dmitrijs Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister, and after three and a half years he returned to the presidency.
The appearance of fish in a garden in Banfas
A man from Banfa asks for help to clarify the circumstances of the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Beins thinks that 75 fish could be sands that have travelled with a water room.
Mr. Beina, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, published a video on the Periscope website, hoping that someone could know how these five centimeters of large fish came into his garden.
Quinspheric crossing: the bridge is now connected to Faifu.
The projects worth 1.35 billion are currently planned to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern part of the Queensphere crossing and viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected with Faifu.
The first of the four connecting parts is completed, meaning that the bridge construction is close to the end.
The construction of the Faifa bridge is 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It consists of 10,000 tons of steel, 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 support cables.
The projects worth 1.35 billion are currently planned to be completed in May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown was on his way to the construction site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queensphere Bridge."
In this project, we see an incapacitated engineering solution, where only more than 30,000 tons of cement and steel are used in the construction of this part.
Despite the enormous weight and size of the bridge, connecting the bridge and viaducts is an extremely delicate process that requires enormous precision.
Overall, more than 79% of the bridge deck is already built and the last phase that will be added to the bridge with Rositu today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for inclusion.
Director of the Four Bridge Connection Project Michael Martins says: "The first link is a very important point in any bridge construction."
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates the highest-class engineering industry.
After the last stage of the road installation and its connection with the north tower support, we were left to connect the north road phase with the part of the ground or viaduct.
This was done by excavating the part of the northern accessory viaduct 700 millimetres south.
It was a huge and at the same time a very delicate operation.
Great, because the route is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tonnes and had to be dragged by about 3 %.
The delicacy, because the tolerance in both directions with which the team worked, was just a few millimeters.
Luckily, everything worked out fine.
Simon Bails gets gold in women's rings.
Forget the fight.
Forget the mess.
Simon Bails doesn't worry about it all.
Dynamic jumps.
Without effort, he's doing his exercises on the balcony.
I can't get to the floor.
It's completely innocent.
And finally the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, 19 - year - old U.S.A., the winner of gold medals, fully demonstrating the difference between himself and the rest of the world on the Olympic scene.
Her total number of points 62,198 was more than the result of the winning of the silver medal and the winning of her team members, the Russian sportsmen of the Russian sportsmen of Alia Mustafina.
On Thursday, US sportsman Simon Bails took the lead in the individual multi-racial women's championship in the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bails became the fourth American in a row, which won the title of the competition champion and the fifth best winner, gradually strengthening the reputation as the best winner of his generation and possibly the best winner in history.
When the outcome was announced, she burst into tears, for the long journey to this moment was over.
This achievement brings them closer to impossible athletes such as Michael Felps, who raised their sport type at another level.
The last three years of Baals have dominated in their form of sport, winning 15 medals at the World Championships, including 10 gold medals, carrying out such excellent, accurate and ambitious engagements that the 1984 Olympic Championship Mérija Lu Retone called him "the best winemaker she's ever seen".
In Brazil she was faced with a final test, where she had to face the hopes that she had put on her own rather than on other sportsmen.
She would be disappointed if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas without gold medals.
The US sportsmen Simona Bails (left) and Alija Raismane, respectively, are in the process of curing gold and silver medals for individual women in the final race at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
The first gold medal was won by Bails on Tuesday, making special selection coordinators Martas Karolis a gift ballet.
Even though Baals claim that there was no such expectation in their long journey to glory, it is not true.
Part of her presentation in the free movement, which included her special acrobatic transition, is accompanied by Latin music, which would be beautifully placed on the street next to the arena of the Rio Olympic Games.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl who was adopted by her parents when she was still a baby and who was discovered by coach Emies Bourman's mother on a tour to the sports hall where the Bartenders were held, has now become the power to be counted.
She has not lost in multi-racial competitions since summer 2013 and victory series can continue as long as she wants.
Although Mustafin’s two rotations were somewhat controlled, it was only illusion.
The balance ball and free movement - part of the competition, where Bails will defend his champion's title, is still just ahead.
She moved forward with score 15,433 on the balcony and strengthened the control with score 15,933 in free movement
Raismane slowly dried her up while waiting for results that were just formality and her tears of joy poured out when a dream that she had once recorded in her book was fulfilled.
Raisman’s result was a small activism for four years of old when she shared third place with Mustafin, but lost her fight for bronze medal.
This time, 22-year-old captain of the team, called the Americans, took the lead.
After her performance in the free movement, which raised doubts about her return, she was able to devote her time to a blow of air.
For the 19-year-old, the viral Twitter r, which she published this week, is already quite different.
6-year-old Mahajs Brown's "crowded" lives in Philadelphia.
The police report that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, indicating that he was already the second six-year-old who was shot in Philadelphia this week.
The parents of the child to the CBS Philadelphia news channel confirmed that it was Mahais Brown.
The elders say that Brown was shot several times, including a circus, a leg, a hand, and a stomach, but they still had in mind when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother Delores Melendez tells the television: "His little body was simply broken down."
I can't believe it.
The boy has been put in a critical condition in the hospital and has already undergone several operations.
The family informs him that he will certainly recover.
He had to start first grade at the local primary school.
Brown is one of the four people who were killed in the part of Germany.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
Canal CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, but the other two sufferers are stable.
The Canal reports that the child was found in the front seat of the car next 29 years in critical condition.
The other two victims were not found in the car, and the police were investigating whether one of them was an intruder.
The investigator told the CBS Philadelphia channel that several shooters were likely to be involved.
At the site of the event is the shells of the gun’s patrons, which belong to various weapons.
It seems to have been a long shot.
The shoes are found on both sides of the entrance.
"So it seems that there have been several armed shooters here who actively took part in the shooting," says Chief of Police of Philadelphia, Antonio Ginaldi.
A number of homes and cars have also been damaged.
No one has been detained yet and it is reported that the police are checking the surveillance cameras.
On Tuesday at the time of the interrogation, a six - year - old girl was hit by a lobe while she was playing in front of her house in the Vestouklein area.
She's getting better, but the police are still looking for the guilty.
Why do we need Simon, Gabia, and Laurie?
I call it the Year's Women for a number of reasons.
First of all, I have been on all the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the US team has never been so good.
Second, this team has three light bulbs, Simon Bails, Gabia Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who are inspired by many new women of origin.
People may be proud that this team also consists of Ali Raisman, a Jew and Medison Kociana, a Catholic.
Finally, this team really represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
In the last four years, the best farmer is the American of African origin.
Last year, Simona and Gabia took 1st and 2nd place.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympics, Gabia Douglas became an outstanding champion, and America was able to win.
Now the world has seen incredible achievements performed by the three-way World Championships Simon Bails, Douglas, and Laurie Hernandez, performing unexpected but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American in a row that has won gold medals for women in an individual multiracial race.
His team member Alija Raismane won a silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can do, but the situation in the other country is completely different in working hours.
Simona, Gabia, and Laurie joined the Olympics as well as Alice and Madison.
They are the "Olympian Five", because the next Olympic Winning team will have only four athletes, and this is coach Marta Karola's last year in the training work.
In fact, exercise is a precious sport. Wingers mainly train in private light-based clubs, and they are supported by parents who pay for training, space, travel, form styles, hotels (trainers, sportsmen and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these lightweight clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs sportsmen take all their trainings, and it is a precious and long contribution to light families.
Emija Būrman - Simona Bails coach and Maggie Hainia - Lauria Hernandez coaches have trained their athletes since the two girls started working with ease.
We need to provide young girls who are inspired by Simon, Gabia, and Laurie with better exercise opportunities.
I founded my lightweight organisation 20 years ago.
My organization is located in Harlem, and we offer more than 15,000 young people (mainly black and Spanish origins) training without charge or at a low price. We have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will discover the branch office in Detroit (in my hometown) to provide local young people with the opportunity to learn about this great sport.
Lightweight develops strength, tension and body coordination, as well as learns serious work, discipline and reaching the goal.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success in both school and work.
This team will inspire thousands of new girls to train in light-duty and this is fantastic.
Working with this type of sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thank you Simona, Ali, Gabia and Medison for the great "Sweet Force" demonstration, winning the Olympics gold medals and motivating countless new, diverse girls of origin to become healthy, strong and successful new women.
Following the rejection of the offer of Jeremy Hunt, the young doctors plan to develop more strikes.
The ministers hoped to close the dispute by reaching agreement on changes to the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association, but rejected 58 per cent of the 37,000 new doctors who participated in the vote.
In July, Hunt announced plans to conclude a contract indicating that NHS is in a unstable state and that further delays will only harm workers and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed the new contract, which provides for changes in working conditions at night and at weekends in order to improve working conditions in hours of work.
Yesterday, the new doctor of BMA, Dr. Elén Macourta, announced that the new doctors still have serious concerns about the contract offered, especially that it will deepen the labour crisis and that it does not provide for equal conditions for all doctors.
Eight weeks remain until the first group of new doctors sign the new contract, so progress should be made, as the time left is limited.
The BMA's efforts to solve the problems through negotiations have been confronted with the government's unwillingness to participate and sometimes with full silence.
This happened despite the fact that last month Jeremiah Hunt said that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must act immediately, stop work and work with the new doctors.
If he does not, then the young doctors are ready for new protests.
During the last strike, more than 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed at the end of April, while nurses and consultants tried to replace the doctors who had gone to the point.
Ministers hoped to close the dispute by reaching agreement on changes to the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants to raise the rate of work per week for 54 000 new doctors subject to new contracts.
NHS Employment Executive Director Daniels Mortimer invited new doctors to stay away from the strike.
Mr Mortimera explains that strikes do not solve anything, but only increases the pressure on the disabled and worries, creates stress and delays in patients, caregivers and their families.
In the last two months, we have spoken with the new Committee of Doctors and together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions have responded positively to their questions about supervisors and rapporteurs.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues such as the placement of workers, flexible training, in addition to training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, abandonment of studies and gender pay in medicine - indicate that employers, the English Health Education Authority and the Ministry of Health want to make serious arrangements with the BME in November, February and May.
This medicine may reduce the risk of heart attack by 2 pounds per day.
Thousands of patients who have had a heart attack could be treated with 2 pounds a day, as official representatives recommend that they take more people and longer periods of time.
The anti-inflammatory medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart beats in people with heart disease.
This medicine is already prescribed for use 12 months after the heart rate by reducing the risk of re- heart rate.
The NHS representative NICE recommends that this medicinal product be administered 4 years after the heart rate to further reduce the risk of heart rate in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, NICE under NHS is currently recommended to use this medicine 4 years after the heart beat to further reduce the risk of heart and blood vessels.
Every year some 140 000 people live in England, and a fourth of them suffer from repeated strokes or strokes.
Cardiac and stroke causes the accumulation of fats in the heart wall by forming prophylaxis.
If a prophylaxis develops, it can cause a drum by blocking the blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
However, if the thrombosis is separated from the blood vessels wall, it may go further into the bloodstream and block access to the brain by causing an attack.
People who have had a heart attack have been exposed to a higher risk of repeated heart attack.
Ticagrelor produced by the UK company AstraZeneca, which is marketed as Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombosis.
The new NICE guidelines published today recommend that people take 90 mg of Ticagrelor for 12 months and 3 years at 60 mg twice daily with aspirin.
NICE Director of Health Technology Professor Kerola Longson explains: "Despite the availability of medication for the prevention of repeated heart beats, more than a quarter of the people who have had a heart stroke have experienced another stroke or stroke, which often have serious consequences."
Fear of repeated heartbeat can have a negative effect on the quality of human life.
Evidence shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of repeated heart beats and heart attack in people who have experienced it once.
We are pleased that we can extend treatment opportunities to thousands of people who are thus benefiting from Ticagrelor.
In view of the limited information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding when taking this medicine for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend that it be used for longer than this period.
The culture of political law promotes fraud in Muslim communities during elections
According to the management report, the former mayor of Tauerhamlet, Lutfurs Rahmans, was fired from office in connection with corruption.
The Government's report reveals that the culture of the right to political law has led to the blinding of large-scale fraud in Muslim communities.
Former Prime Minister Sers Eriks Pickles criticises the police, election guards and city councils that they ignore the signs of fraud in the electoral process, because "is afraid of affecting ethnic and religious interests."
The former secretary of the community, who has now become the head of the anti-corruption organisation, says that the banning of voters is so widespread for religious reasons that the police should allow guards to be placed at the polling stations to protect the voters.
He also recommends that the electorate should present a supporting document to the persons when they vote to prove their true identity.
At present, only the name and address of the vote must be indicated.
He even recommends marking the fingers of voters with special ink to prevent a double vote.
The rapporteurs must also provide greater protection, says Sir Eriks.
He believes that the press should provide greater access to Council documents and decisions adopted by informal committees and working groups.
He says: "The goal is not only to prevent fraud, but also to protect the local government from more corruption and the culture of fraud that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was ordered by Dauningstrit after a scandal in connection with the elections of the city of Tauerhamlet.
Last year, the Court of Special Election decided to remove the city mayor Lutfur Rahman from the city's office due to corruption and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman had "skinned down" the religious view of his Muslim community and had turned down his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman has led his election campaign with guidance that the religious duty of faithful Muslims is to vote for him."
About 300 votes were falsified or questionable because one person had voted several times.
Sir Eriks also points out that there are signs of fraud across the country.
He pointed out that it was particularly disturbing to vote in favour of a post, where the senior members of the Muslim community forced others to vote in favour of themselves.
Sir Eric recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of a document proving the identity of the person.
Her report says: "The evidence shows that members of unprotected ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are forced to vote in favour of the community's older elected candidates, particularly in Bangladesh and Pakistan."
"There are concerns that the regional authorities do not pay attention to these problems because of political law, as it could affect ethnic and religious interests."
Ms. Erics made 50 recommendations on improving the electoral system, which also includes the ban on political activists from working with the votes cast by mail to prevent the "collection of votes".
The Tereza Meja report also called for a more thorough registration check to prevent the use of electoral lists in the field of immigration and benefits.
Consider the possibility before the vote to ask voters to present a document proving the person.
Mark the fingers of voters with special ink to prevent a double vote.
To systematically check the nationality of persons to ensure that the person has the right to vote.
Set three-year limitation requests for automatic postal voting.
To prohibit political campaign participants and activists from working with votes cast through postal and electoral rounds to vote by post.
To provide the police with the power to appoint a guard to the polling stations.
To amend the law to facilitate the call for persons to be held liable for the prohibition under the 1983 Human Rights Act.
Refusal to photograph the election in the polls.
Determine the requirement to use only English in the polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that voters go to the polling stations on a case-by-case basis.
Sir Erics has been criticising the Metropolis police for not being aware of the charges in the Tauerhamlet case.
He says: "The election of the court was only disqualified by Lufthansa Rahman and his representatives for actions related to corruption and fraud."
He was convinced that he was found guilty of a standard of criminal law on the basis of unscrupulous evidence.
He also criticises the "check of cheques" of the voters of the inefficient city council in the registration of voters.
Sir Erics points out: "The court decision taken last year is a alarm call.
Our country is known as the homeland of parliament, but the spread of fraud and the existence of a disturbing and secret election and the authorities that fraud does not threaten this good reputation.
Rhythm with riders - Keitas companions and other members of the Rio Olympic Celebration
The fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics are excited about the French rider Pauline Ferrando Prevota, whom the fans considered to be extremely similar to the Hercogie of Cambridge.
However, the 24 - year - old rider is not the only athlete who fights this summer for gold, who, as the media say, boasts of his famous companion.
Therefore, for the honour of the Rio Olympic Games and all the famous meetings that are currently visible on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympic players, which are incredibly similar to the Hollywood stars.
Medniek and Vilka: Member of the US Firearm Breidijs Elisons, on the left, since childhood compared to Leonardo Di Kaprio
Despite the fact that Keita’s roommates are on the track, many people on the Internet point out that this pilot could be the superstar brother of Leonardo Di Kaprio’s twins.
A member of the U.S. men's band of shooters Breidy Elisons caused a windshield when photographs were published, where he was very similar to Volstrites Vil.
The sportsman himself noticed the wind in the social media and recognized that he had been compared to Leonardo Di Kaprio since he was a child.
"I don't personally see a great similarity, except for the bar," Breidy tells the edition of Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome king, so I think he's a compliment."
This year, even more popularity will undoubtedly be one of the most popular pairs of London Olympics players in 2012: a devastating similarity between British remote Greg Ruterford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian light-headed Alija Mustafin is compared to Gloria Estefan, the American singer of Cuban origin, thanks to her large, expressive eyes.
As regards swimming, the Southern African swimmer Camerons van der Burgs has been compared for several years to the "Raditi View" star Metju Morrison.
Changes: This user has noticed that Nathan is an actor’s “Inception” version of the film.
Also, the old companions are the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnet, with similar hooks and lips.
Russian gold medalist, dancer Julia Efimova and actress Annalina Makcorda can not only boast of the skin and blonde hair that is in the sun. Meanwhile, fans believe that the athletic US sportsman Nathan Adrian is like Joseph Gordon Levit.
Poor women: The football star (left) Hopai Solo and the series "Deksters" actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) is the same face and eyes.
There is one: some Twitter user was pleasantly surprised to learn that others also view these similarities
Theory: This user believes that there may be a reason why both seem so similar
Recently, a Twitter user with genuine pleasure announced that "the other internet users agree that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter actually look identical."
The U.S. football star and the series "Deksters" actress are really very similar to the shape of the face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons relate to Carrie Volš Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to Laura Line's smile. Also, the light gold medal winner Gabi Duglas boasts a beautiful, wide smile that resembles the "Bring It On" starring Gabriels Union smile.
The CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for his comment that the Chinese swimmer has been 'finished as a pig'.
Bairona Makdonalda's analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhas final fourth place in a 4x200 m free-style stadium for women, called for comfort wind in CBC viewers.
Canada's CBC channel was forced to apologize because one of its commentators commented that 14 years old Chinese swimmer from the competitions had been "flighted out of the competitions that he smiled alone" and "ends like a pig".
Commentary Bairon Macdonalds thought that his microphone was turned off when 4x200 m free-style staphyte women finally expressed their personal opinion.
Macdonald, who was included in the CBC team of commentators to give comments on life, said, "This little 14-year-old from China is unable to keep up with."
"Before she fell asleep, she ran out of the game that she smiled alone and ended up like a pig."
Thank you very much.
The result of the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhanan in the second phase was 1:57.79, which is 1.61 seconds slower than the result of the Canadian Telores Ruck, allowing Canadians to reach China.
Viewers throughout Canada reacted immediately on the Internet because they were shocked to hear such tone and statements.
Emets Makfarlain wrote on Twitter: "Did the CBC's direct comment just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "ends like pigs"????.
Idiots don't understand that they were still in the straight attic.
Ai Yanha from China 4x200m free-style final women were called "a small 14-year-old from China who doesn't belong."
Criticism against the Baron Macdonald quickly came into force, as many asked for explanations.
Twitter users were unable to trust when listening to Barion Macdonalda's insensitive comments.
Twitter user Sarah Paradi wrote: "Oh, #ByronMacDonald.
You're a representative of CBC and Canada and because of you we're all acting as racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was currently conducting the CBC's live radio, apologized for Macdonalda's comments, saying, "We apologize for the comment on the result of the swimming in the direct ether."
It was a bad choice of words, and we are very sorry that it happened.
CBC apologized for more than 90 people who responded to this comment.
McDonald's colleagues, Scott Russell, came to apologize for his place.
Then CBC added an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about Macdonalda's comment.
The channel also quickly published an apology and a statement.
We are very sorry that such comments have been made and they have come to the right place.
Yesterday we immediately responded and apologized to all the viewers and followers of the social media.
For the sake of clarity, Bairon’s comments were expressed about the performance of the swimmer, not addressed to her personally.
However, in any case they were unprofessional and failed to choose the phrases and Bairon was very sorry for what happened.
On Thursday afternoon, Macdonald personally apologized to the direct ether and tried to explain that he did not think that his comment would be perceived as a personal attack.
He said: "I would like to use the moment and apologise for the comment I made yesterday after women's free-style competitions."
I'm talking about a swimmer's performance, not his personal performance.
To say that I didn’t intend to show disrespect, I’m really sorry that it happened.
Primark’s buyers are shocked by a woman who is unharmed in the basement store.
The buyers felt uncomfortable when the woman began to dress in order to fit in the middle of the shop.
Even worse, she took them to make sure that they were present and then pulled them back into the store.
She continued looking for clothes at the Folkeston Bouverie Place Trade Centre store and agreed to four more bicycles.
Primark shop Bouverie Place in the shopping center of Folkeston – the place where this woman held the basement and then put it back in the hair.
At that time there were also two children in the shop, Jania Davidson, who said that an unknown woman, after she had put on her underwear and left the shop, did not buy anything.
She points out that people could not trust their eyes.
Standing in the middle of the shop, she took off her hair underpants, pulled off her socks and trousers, and also measured them on the spot.
She did not even try to find a more discreet place where to measure them, she simply kept them in place.
Everyone looked at her shirts and apparently didn’t like them because she just put them back in her hair.
She measured three more bicycles until she decided that she didn’t like any of them and left the store.
He did not feel that he would be attracted to someone who looked at him or to the person who would buy the clothes he liked.
Davidson's novelist (33 years) from Kent says: "It's a good idea that someone will buy clothes that have been accepted by other people and that are not then emptied."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson's novelist adds: "I accept that after she left, the shop staff removed those clothes from the shop's hair - which is also acceptable."
I can't imagine buying a new basement and knowing that another woman has kept it and then it's not empty.
The representative of Primark pointed out that Primark was aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August.
Specific clothing is removed from the store’s hair.
How to Protect Yourself From Guns by Using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect ourselves in a close distance from the firefighters, we talked to the Major of Krav Maga from New York Ron Mizraki.
Whether you attack from the front or the back, this video shows how to protect yourself and get over the lift.
Misraki points out that if the attacker attacks from the back, it must first turn to clearly see the attacker and avoid any such trajectories.
Then the weapon must be placed between his front hand and his back and made a sit on the opponent's face with his free elonons.
Then, as long as the attacker gets stuck in pain, he must withdraw his weapon, go face-to-face with the gun’s spine and retreat, continuing to turn his weapon against him.
If the attacker is approaching from the front, the situation is similar - it must be avoided from any such trajectory, the weapon must be blocked and replaced so that the wicked cannot be shot.
At the same time, pressure must be exerted on the weapon and a sit-in must be carried out by the opponent on the chest and finally withdraw the weapon and refrain from continuing to discuss it.
Does it sound complicated?
Watch the video to see how Misraki does it.
But remember, if you're not Krav Maga master, then it's safer to return your money to the farmer.
The water family is demolishing the social home of Saltaša Kornvola and is on the street.
The water family has been left out of the neighborhood for the terror of the neighbors, causing damage to the social home to the size of 50,000 martyrs.
Tanja Skeldona and her partner, Sean Trebilkok, were left behind by property in Saltaš Kornvola, as several complaints were made about them.
When they were forced out of the property, the shocked housekeepers found that the property was completely demolished.
There were holes in the floors and walls, waste was washed everywhere, and walls were covered with graphite.
The family is now out of the property and most likely lives in a private property.
The manager of the Cornvolt Housekeeping Service, Donna Makevoja, says there are concerns that housing will not be possible to restore.
She says that people who lived here were extremely difficult and she feels that people can’t live there.
In this case, a number of factors need to be assessed, as the property in Cornvolu will no longer have a good reputation.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who were periodically held in possession, and the police said that their terror turned out to be violence, expulsion from the street with baseball bats, banishment of locals, drug use, drug sale, and sound abuse and harassment.
In June, 47 - year - old Skoldton was sentenced to antisocial behaviour.
In several demolished rooms the waste was found.
In a house where drugs may be marketed in advance, a number of floors have also been created.
Neighbors say they've been on the street regularly and constantly called the police.
The Cornvola Housekeeper left them under pressure when they were given 11 weeks to leave the house voluntarily.
The missing neighbors were very happy about the outcome, for their lives were absolute.
One said, "They didn't care about other people."
We lived for them for 20 years, it's always been crazy.
I can't believe how many times we've seen the police here.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because there was so quiet here - we haven't been there!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be wonderful here.
Adam Fitzpatriks, who is the guardian of the neighbourhood of the Kornvola Homes Service, said that the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family lived here for 20 years and here was regularly called the police.
In the grown-up garden, various old and unused items were found.
He also said, "It is very sorry that the tenants have not shown any responsibility for their behavior, because leaving the house is always the last step the Cornvola Housekeeper considers."
This was a very difficult case because their behavior was extreme and their neighbors had been very hard to see in their behavior.
I appreciate the work that my entire team, Devona and Cornvola police and members of the community, who were courageous and cooperated with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will ease the lives of our neighbours and show that antisocial behaviour is not acceptable.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived here for different periods of time, but all were about 20 years old.
A clean mattress, which remained on the floor in one of the rooms after leaving.
Staff will now have to clean up the waste left at home.
In 2014, the police house was cut down and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, weights, accessories and 1700 pounds in cash.
Skedton was only known to be responsible for the storage of Class B drugs for their distribution.
She said that the money was intended for the memory of her son, Lee Sheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After leaving, it is known that they are now renting a private property in Plimut.
On many of the walls of the house were graphite.
Police report that they will continue to expel tenants who violate their rental contracts.
Devona and Kornvola Police Representative Angela Krova points out that this outbreak is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
She also said, "This is a warning to those who think they can act like a will and it will have no consequences."
Devona and Krovola police do not accept criminal and anti-social behaviour, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect the local communities.
The readiness to spend can give impetus to the economy.

The cannon measure bans burkini swim costumes in the beaches.
The mayor of the southern French town of Kannu is forbidden to wear burkini swimwear in this city’s beaches, which is almost completely covered by the woman’s body and is very reminiscating of the hydro-clothes, local officials announced on Thursday.
Kannu Mayor David Linars has signed an order that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited to anyone who does not have a swimwear that respects good practices and secularism" as the basic principle of the French Republic.
"Pludmal clothing, which exhibits external religious affiliation during the time when France and the places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks, can create a risk of public disorder (distortion, clashes, etc.) which is necessary to prevent," the order said.
"We are talking, not about the prohibition of religious symbols in the beach, but about outer clothing related to the trust movements of terrorists who fight with us," explained the head of the municipal municipal services in Tjeri Miguels.
He added that burkini swim costumes in the Kannu beaches have not been seen since 28 July, when the good members of the Central Party "Republicans" Linars signed this order and it came into force.
This week, the Aquapark in the city of Marseille recalled a planned private event for Muslim women who would wear burkins in swimwear, as the complicity of such an event was expressed by both the good and the left-wing politicians.
In France it is prohibited to wear hats of Muslim women’s heads, but no religious symbols or appropriate clothing are prohibited.
On July 14, Cannam was killed by 85 people in a terrorist group organized in the nearby town of Nice, the Islamic State.
On July 26, two instigators, who had vowed allegiance to the State of Islam, brutally murdered priests in the church in the north-west of France.

The festival "Cubán" started in Lucavsala.
Thursday, August 11th, the evening of Lucavsal was given a start to one of the last festivals this summer - there will be "Cubane" until Sunday night.
During the first evening meetings, groups such as "Enter Shikari" from Great Britain that were expected to last, but the program did not disappear, American punks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from the group "The Prodigy" and others.
The following days of the festival also feature the distinguished words - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", the founder of the pancroque legend "Ramones", Marky Ramons with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkryeg", "Brutto&Lyapis" with the Belarusian pancroque leaders in the front of Sergei Mikhalok, the popular Georgian actor and singer Wahtangs Kikabide, the Ukrainians "Vopli Vidoplyasova" and a number of others, but the full programme of the event can be considered here.
This is the second year of the "Cubana" festival in Latvia.
Before it was a financial failure and huge losses, but it did not stop the organizers from trying again - they added a term of length, also included a group of Latvians (on Friday evening 19:15 at the scene of "All Day Long") and announced that the festival now became "closer and has acquired a local color with such Riga symbols as its panorama and cats".
Whether these efforts will be justified, even early to decide, because the festival only bursts, but, as Delfi Entertainment observed in the first evening, at least in the meantime, the huge efforts of people were not made and the number of visitors was similar to that of a child.
The British troika racing team doubles a good Olympic record and wins the race.
The British team's third team twice repaired the Olympic record on Thursday and won the race for men.
The first Olympic record was improved by the British, but in the first round, it was re-corrected by the New Zealanders.

The UK final team won 42,440 seconds, overcoming the young men by 0.102 seconds.
In the fight for bronze, the French team was able to overcome Australia.

President who remained in the shadow: Gustav Zemgal - 145.
On Friday, August 12, 145 years of circulation, since the birth of the second President of Latvia Gustav Zemgals.
The Land has proclaimed Latvia, but the unemployed have remained largely described by the first president of Latvia, Jāņas Chakste, and the last president of the previous period.
None of our fellow citizens has defended democracy and the rule of law as well as the book by Arnold Auziņš, published by Gustav Zemgal, ten years ago.
In a conversation with the Delfi portal, Auziņš stresses that the Earth is one of the rare high-ranking politicians who have had a sense of humor.
The others are so stiff, they're always very right.
He taught not to be such, but it could be similar today to that of Raymond Vionius.
"He was the one who is close to the people," says Auznih.
Today’s politicians have a bad history, they have referred to Karli Ulman as a good leader, but rarely anyone knows how negative he was.
The only person on the board to whom he was not a member of the government was General Balody.
Even if he is kind and funny in the pictures, he has been historic in nature.
"The earth with its sense of humor and democraticity leaves the opposite impression," says Auziņš.
Professor Aivars Stranga of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia, in a conversation with Delfi, agrees to hear the evaluation of Zemgal as a peaceful and well-founded national.
He also notes that Zemgals has stood up with respect for minorities, regularly inviting the Jewish representatives to the palace of the President.
"It was not an act at the time, after the Zemgal presidency Albert Kwiess took over this tradition," says the historian.
He was such a quiet and prominent man who had long had to speak as president.
He didn't think about it himself, he just didn't want fame.
He also considered himself rather critical because he did not know French, but felt that the president must understand it.
"At the time of the presidency, the French-language frameworks were taught," Stranga explains.
The earth was not allowed to be re-elected, and it did not seem to be a very high position.
In any event, he is a very respected person in Latvia's history, and he was a very demanding notary in the castle before the President's arrival.
Zemgal also led the famous Zemgala cass in Suvorova Street 3, where there was a stock exchange and stock exchange company, in which virtually government negotiations became a state of Latvia.
He was always progressive.
He was not a great honorer of Ulmana, but he was not opposed by the public.
"In the private negotiations it has sometimes been said that the real Ulman's actions are not sympathetic to him," Stranga points out.
He lived a peaceful life, no doubt about immorality or corruption.
How is Zemgalus remembered today?
I'm sorry, but for the most part he's only associated with some street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, he thought he was central.
"There were no major disturbances at the time, i.e. he could be associated with such a real stable presidency," Stranga concludes.
During the presidency of Gustav Zemgal, from 1927 to 1930, a visit to Latvia took place in Sweden, which at the time indirectly meant full recognition in the neighbouring country and inclusion in the family of the democratic nations of Northern Europe.
On 28 May 1929, Landgals arrived at a national visit to Stockholm.
A visit to the reply of King Gustav V of Sweden took place in Latvia on 29 June 1929.
The second president of Latvia was born in 1871, but he died in January 1939.
A simple way to help a child cope with anger attacks.
I often come face - to - face with the fact that a child’s anger, an insomnia, is viewed by parents as something wrong and abnormal.
When the child openly expresses his anger - we don't know how to react, "Econet" says psychologist Jekaterina Kesa.
The expert encourages small negotiations on these natural and human feelings - anger and resentment, which each experiences periodically.
Aggression - it is already the physical action addressed to other people, and it usually occurs when we feel angry.
When we are adults, we are angry, upset - usually we know what is happening to us and how to deal with it.
We can express, suppress, hide, keep ourselves, tell about it to our friends or other relatives, we can be angry to sell a divan, smoke cigarettes (it's not the best way to get angry!), go in the shower, come in with a cupboard and do other things that we don't usually do.
We do not turn our aggression against others because we know how to deal with these emotions.
Children, when angry, do not understand what is happening to them, how to name them, and how to live with them.
They can say, "Come away!", you're a fool, you're a bad mother, I don't hurt you, I won't threaten you" - and very rarely when you can say, "I'm mad at you."
Children live literally, they are right here right now, they are spontaneous and truly in expressing their feelings, and they are often in the mood of different emotions.
It is very important that parents do not prevent the child from expressing their feelings, including anger, not being alarmed about it or not, but, on the contrary, helping the child.
Should relationships be interrupted?
A long working day, where everything has not always happened as you would like, or simply a bad outlook - there are so many reasons why you would want to be at the moment, day or even longer "off" from all over the world.
Is it possible to develop a relationship at the moment and a little bit of excitement?
However, does it show that each of the partners is on their way?
In his opinion, the gentlemen were divided into different ages.
John (23) is short and nuclear: "In my view, if the relationship is necessary, then don't be with the real person."
Eduards (30) has discovered a scheme that is possible to help.
If you feel that your partner starts to feel nervous about every detail, then it's certainly the right time to look at other fields of hunting to see if you miss her, or especially about her not thinking about her or even not wanting to see her anymore.
So the answer is - yes, stopping a break can help save time and understand how important you are to the other side.
Caspar (29) reveals his theory.
I think it is important to keep relations together on the second day, because if you spend 24 hours a day with a person, seven days a week, the disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the sight of every detail that the other person does, and it begins to fall on the nerves.
People start to blame each other, especially when there is nothing more to talk about than what you do day by day.
My personal experience makes me think so, so I haven’t had a relationship for more than a few months.
If you think for a moment that somewhere or others are better - then why did this woman, with whom you have earned, deserve someone who can think that there is not good enough and there are paradise fields behind the mountains?
Thinking is already a small task.
If it's not, then it's not.
"I am, therefore, a little condemned to those who are not." says Edmunds (46).
Karlim (33) is quite the opposite of that.
I'm saying everyone needs a moment to stay.
You can't look at each other every moment, all the time, from morning to evening, looking at each other and looking at the love that's unsatisfied.
Attopies!
There are so many things - friends, jobs, ballets.
It's all my time.
Of course, even the congregation or the wife, however, if both realize that they can maintain a balance between family life and the rest of the world, it can survive to the end of the grave.
That's it.
March (27) says it: "It is difficult to say - whether it is necessary or not, it may or may not take a break, but one is clear - to its proposer something to the end is not something lacking."
If this question arises, then it must be calculated that there will be some change in the near future - on the right side or on the wrong side, it depends on itself.
I think as long as you're new and crazy, as long as you're gone, it's necessary - at least all the time, but when everything remains serious and the relationship goes into a completely different phase, then there can be no talking about rest.
But you have decided to spend all your life together!
"If you can't handle one another now and once in a while need a room, then there will be when you will be pensioners who comment on how long-lasting cats are tired or arguing about what the day the garden needs to be better planted," explains Christap (19).
All the words of the Lord have been changed.
With his exciting and exciting personality, Rosental was the first to change Latvian people’s interest in visual arts.
"In this sense he was the first love of the Latvian people, which will remain forever unforgivable," wrote Roman Suta about Latvian art teacher Jani Rozental.
Also in 2016, when the old master's wide retrospective exhibition was discovered in the main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art, it is clear - Rosental is the first love of Latvian art.

In fact, it is very provocative, on the balancing work of fraud and banal vulgarity, which makes it difficult to draw the line between the European art house film and the Hollywood genre product.
The film with Vigo Mortensen focuses on the question of whether the parents' conceptually chosen life models (environmental, vegetarian, alternative and exclusion from the stupidity and values of the consumer society) bring blessings or destructiveness to their children.

The Islamic state has captured 2,000 civilians in Syria.
The Islamic state fighters of the terrorist group, fleeing Menbija, the Syrian Aleppo province, were captured by approximately 2,000 civilians, who were used as a living force, by US-supported Kurdu and Arab allies and observers on Friday.
"We killed them because they took civilians with them when they fled to Jerabulus," said a press representative of the military council in Kurdu Menbija.
After a two-month battle, the Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), which is supported by the US Kurdish-Arab Alliance in the north of Syria, announced on Friday that Menbiza has been released from the jihadists.
The Islamic State of Menbiz accepted in 2014.
The QSD was raised last week by most of the "Islamic State" fighters from Menbija, but some of them endured and showed their own resistance.
On Friday, however, they left the city, taking the winners with them.
The Islamics go to Jerábulus, which is near the Turkish border.
Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) also reported that "Islamic State" has kidnapped about 2000 people.
SOHR reported that the Islamics kidnapped the city’s cars, forced people to assemble in them, and then taken them to Jerábulus.
The Islamic nation's fighters have also committed mass kidnappings.
In January, Islamists raided more than 400 civilians, including women and children, in the province of Deir ez Zoras in eastern Syria.
Later, some 270 Muslims were released from their homes.
How many Islamic soldiers have fled from Menbija, is unknown.
The media representative of the Kurdish military council of Menbija reported that the QSD had managed to rescue 2,500 people who had been captured by Islamists in Menbiz.
The information collected by SOHR shows that at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, have lost their lives in the Menbish fight.
299 QSD fighters and 1019 jihadists were killed.
Kolegova refuses to apply to the VID driver's post.
Inga Kolīgova, Head of the National Environment Service, decided to withdraw his candidacy as Director-General of the National Revenue Service (VID), informed the Agency in the Ministry of Finance.
Kolegova points out that her candidacy consultation has increased between the ruling coalition parties.
It seems that the real reasons for the discussions are related to the visible but more frequent, invisible interests and they have nothing to do with the assessment of my professional capacity.
"It's not acceptable to me," he said, "that has already been the applicant for the VID's position.
In the event that her candidacy was approved by the Government, it would be clear that this would not be a convincing vote and would not allow the necessary changes to the IIDs to be fully worked and implemented, with all government support.
Without it, full - time work would not be possible, Kolígova concludes.
"I have repeatedly publicly stressed that I do not want to be politically dependent, but at the moment all my candidacy process is too politicized," explains the official.
"Thanks for the confidence and support I have shown, it is the experience I value as a benefit," Reizniecie-Ozolai writes Kolígova.
The unit said Wednesday that during the meeting with Kolegovu there were "essential contradictions" between the explanations of the candidate and the information available in the public registers on the costs of dividends of SIA Paloggs, as publicly available decisions of the Palogg meetings of participants provide no profit to be broken.
Currently, Deputy Director-General Dace Pelēk is in charge of the VID.

During a half - hour period, law enforcement officers identified the possible location of the children’s parents and went on their way.
When the women arrived at a civilian home, the police found that the woman was asleep because she was in a strong mood for alcohol.
After the initial day of the evening of the preceding day, in 1992, the woman moved to a congregation where she had taken alcohol.
When she went home after a joint meeting, the woman decided to leave the children at the store under unforeseen circumstances.
The police immediately informed the court, which will also decide on the child’s next fate.
The Riga Freelance has introduced all the recommendations of the UK regarding the project of the Russian island.
The Riga Freelance Administration has implemented all of the five recommendations of the State Control (SSC) regarding the development of the project Infrastructure for the transfer of port activities from the city centre to the Russian island, the Dina.lv portal informed the company.
The approval of the project is planned at the next meeting of the Riga Free House.
In order to introduce recommendations in accordance with the opinion of the VC, in preparing the documentation necessary for the implementation of the recommendations, the Riga Free Office also followed the conclusions of the legal and operational audit conducted by the international auditor Deloitte Riga Freeport and the recommendations made to improve project management during the next phase of the project.
Information on the implementation of recommendations has also been sent to the UK today.
In spite of the fact that the Riga Freelance Administration does not agree with the opinion prepared by the UK on the usefulness of the Russian island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and for the European Commission (EC) funding provider.
I would like to stress that all the planned construction works within the project have been fully completed within the deadlines and the planned amount.
"In order to prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the UK and the Stavitors that the main objective of the free movement is to successfully implement the project, we have put in place all the recommendations of the UK on project management and monitoring issues," says the head of the project of the Russian island, Sanita Kaire.
The existing long-term action plan for the control and monitoring of the project's objective was complemented by the main planned actions of the parties involved and the necessary decision-making deadlines, meeting and regular reporting definitions and their deadlines, the planned construction process monitoring instruments and the most important border-point definitions.
The approved action plan to achieve the project target by 31 December 2018, as recommended by the UK, has been complemented by the implementation monitoring activities, thereby strengthening the control of the time-limits for the activities of other parties involved in the implementation of the project on the part of the Riga Freelance Party.
A project management plan has been redesigned for the development of project management and for the reduction of potential risks, defining the project management areas and specifying the documents that provide the control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
To increase the project capacity, a project management framework has been developed which reflects the structure, qualifications and functions of the project management team planned.
In order to improve the communication of the Riga Freelance Administration with the parties involved in the project, a communication plan of the stakeholders in the project, which in addition to those set out in the plan of action, defines the project's successful completion of the project, the principles, types and periodicity of the exchange of information.
However, in order to improve the control of the use of financial resources, the need for the conclusion of a service contract or the start of a procurement contract and the need for legal certainty will continue to be more detailed.
Within the framework of the project, the Russian island has built a world-wide port infrastructure – four new deep-water reservoirs, rail pipelines, and engineering communications.
The co-financed buildings of the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation at the end of the year already spent, with a budget savings of EUR 10.6 million.

Slovakia is the EU Presidency by January.
German researchers are discussing the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to a new study, the number of people who died at the communists ’ former Eastern border could be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the true number of victims have not yet been raised.
According to data released on Wednesday, the Berlin Wall Museum of Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989, at the West Associated Zones border, and later the Western Communist authorities buried 1841 people who tried to get out of their controlled territory.
The museum has been investigating border-related deaths for years and is constantly adjusting the number of victims.
This year, 11 more deaths have been added to the list, including among victims including six-year-old boys who die trying to reach the family through the current Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are Soviet army deserters.
"The true extent of the damage caused by the double evil of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," says museum director Alexander Hildebrande.
"Our task is to ensure that the hats of the people who died trying to escape from the Communist-controlled state will be taken together and lost," the Hildebrande spreads out.
However, other researchers have already questioned new figures.
In an interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung, Süddeutsche Zeitung, expert in Eastern History at the Berlin Free University, Johannes Statts, said.
He and other researchers at the Berlin Free University are currently reviewing possible suspected deaths at the border, and so far only 260 cases have been approved.
In the past, researchers estimate that only 138 people have been blinded by the Berlin Wall.
In view of those who have died, attempting to escape the Baltic Sea or to enter the West through neighbouring countries, the number of victims could be estimated to be about a thousand.
However, this is significantly less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the different number of victims could be different methodologies.
Checkpoint Charlie Museum also records all cases of suicide of Eastern border guards regardless of whether they were directly related to their service.
The museum also records deaths that are not related to direct violence.
"If seniors aged 70 to 80 years after contact with border control mira from the heart strike, it must be considered as the consequences of this "slip" border, Hildebrande.
However, the State is convinced that there is a need to make a distinction between the elderly people who may have died as a result of their experiences and those whose death has resulted in a long waiting for them on the hot bus at the border.
Regardless of its victims' record, it is not easy because the Communist Eastern authorities have not collected such statistics, and researchers are required to select documents in various scattered archives, states.
However, the State party has recently produced new documents and could therefore come up with an estimate of the number of new victims in the near future.
LPF President Pone went to Rio with coach accreditation; this is a surprise.
In the last few days, President Kaspars Pone Riodežaneiro has come with coach accreditation, but he feels surprised at it.
On Wednesday, a wide variety of axioms followed the remarks made by the Olympic swimmer Alona Ribakov coach, German Jakubovska, who discovered that at the last moment in Rio de Janeiro, he decided to go to Pone while the coach had to stay home.
The list of drivers was initially approved by the swimmers Alona Ribakova and Uvis Kalniņš, coach Jakubovskis and Dev Kolins, as well as the Federation President Pone.
The Latvian Swimming Federation applied five participants to the Olympics, and Aldon Vrublävskis claimed that Germany will be and will be searched for tickets before the departure.
"However, apparently for objective reasons, he was not," said Mr., expressing the view that this did not affect Ribaku's outcome.
At the request of the federation, the Uvja coach agreed to help her.
Mr., himself a member of the LOC Executive Committee, was perhaps criticising the operation of the LOC by blaming the Olympic Sports Supervisory Organisation.
In my view, it is not ethical in the LOC Executive Committee to approve five persons and not bring any of them in.
"I don't know why the Swimming Federation did not have enough seats," said Mr. Pone, saying that the work of the federations and their presidents has not been evaluated in society, reminding us that the presidents of the federation are not getting wages.
Also, Mr. Jakubovski criticised himself, saying that before the London Olympic Games, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and asked Latvia not to send any athletes.
However, he could not tell why he was in the Olympics with coach accreditation, which probably had to come to Jakubovski.
"I was applied as the president of the federation ("team leader"), but for some unknown reason, I received coach accreditation and now I'm nowhere inside."
The situation changed every day, the number of accreditations available changed.
Until the last moment, I thought that German would be, because I had no other information.
According to the information available to the agency LETA, a few days before Ribakova started, she had had an eye-to-eye conversation with Poni and after her swimmer had had tears in her eyes, but the president of the LPF himself said it was a daily conversation with the desire to get the athletes out before the start.
He recalled that the LPF oversees five sports types in the Olympic Programme, and four of them are also training for children in Latvia.
The president of the Federation said that it is also very important in Latvia that the issues of slicing, and also for such programmes, he has talked about, when Riodežaneiro has been in attendance for almost two weeks.
He celebrated the Federation's work and said that in 2018 the World Cup could be held in Latvia.
Location Riodežaneiro is not my vacation, here I work, spend my time and try to implement four-quarters programmes.
There will be 600,000 salmon.
The AS Latvenergo fish resources renewal programme is taking place in Daugav in Mangalsala this week, with more than 600,000 single-year-old salmon and tuna being grown in the Bior Tomes and Doles fishyards.
Latvenergo agency Leta informed that the introduction of fish will continue in the months to come - every year, 6 300 000 different species of small fish and crustaceans are introduced in the Daugavas basin.
In the spring and early summer 2016 will be released in June - sigha, July - spring salmon, August and September - sandarts and whims.
The director of the Latvenergo production, Māris Kunjickis, said that the environmental concerns are one of the cornerstones of the sustainable development of the Latvenergo group.
"In measures to protect and propagate fish resources, any action is aimed at environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, both in the production and introduction of small fish in the Daugavas basin and in the implementation of other activities," Kužickis said.
This year, more than 600,000 single-year-old salmon and tambourine will be introduced into the Daugava game.
For the second year, small fish are marked before the introduction by cutting the fat.
Today's cargo contains 25 000 small salmon with an average weight of 31,3 grams.
Each year, in scientificly justified species and in numerical quantities in Daugav and its basin waters, there is the introduction of small fish and crustaceans.
The increase in fish resources in Daugav and its basin waters in accordance with the regulatory acts shall be carried out by Bior on the basis of the expert knowledge of the damage caused by the economic activity of Latvenergo and the conclusion of the compensation measures to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
On the other hand, on the basis of that expertise, the State Environment Service shall decide on the amount and type of compensation.
The annual amount of compensation for Latvenergo in the fish resources recovery programme is EUR 1,035 000.
In the spring of 2016 Latvenergo, in cooperation with the company "We Fish" the fifth year is located 400 artists' nests in Daugava near Kabul and Ikšķiles.
Cooperation with the company, promoting the natural resources of the fish, is also supported by Latvenergo in addition to the programme for the renewal of the fishing resources initiative.
The placement of artificial nests in the reservoir is an important measure that contributes to the protection and reproduction of fish resources in Daugav.
The festival "Sansusus concert hall" is a farm, a forest, a circus.
Guli in the tent, eat as a restaurant, walk in the cages and listen to the researched chamber music, enjoying the quiet nature of peace, - such a combination offers an alternative chamber music festival in Sansus, which is already invited to the Aknyeste novad on the third summer.
The festival will take place in Sussai - no longer an existing village - in the former palace courtyard, next to forests and circuses.
In three days - from August 12 to 14 - five views can combine the joys of carefree nature and academic music.
Here is a music theatre and contemporary church, performances and installations.
Opera and academic music, especially in its latest expressions, finds new audiences in a free and open environment without the insistence of concert halls.
The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but only a few minutes walk to the face and ease.
"Please do not look for a program, because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it before, so that people do not go to one particular event or artist, because the real taste in Sansui can only be absorbed by spending all three days in it," invites the festival initiator and host, operabaritone Armands Silinh.
The festival doors are really Friday at 5:00 p.m., and the first concert is at 19:00.
Of course, there will be programmes on the spot with all the information.

"The names of artists are available on the website www.sansi.lv", says Armands Silinh.
The bouquet of artists includes, for example, the vijolliere Eva Bindere, the chalice Kristíne Blaumane, the opera star Inga Kalna, the clarinetist Guntis Kuzma, the trumpeter Janis Porietis, the pianist Reinis Zariņš, the Quartets Quadra and RIX and even the Estonian air acrobat Grete Gross, who together with Latvian musicians Eric Kirshfeld, Martin Zilbert and the actress Anci Strazdu have created a contemporary circus performance Confines for the artist's internal struggle.
New work has also become a special festival.
In the exhibition for children "Kukauinis", composed by Oljes Kozlovska and Jäkabs Nimanis, after F. Kafka's story, the entomologist (Skuin researcher) will participate with Armand Siliņus, musicians and actors, Ugis Peteran.
Oscar Herliņš won the first Stig Quartet, while Anna Čirse - wood opera, performance, whose main heroes in Andra Kalnozol's mode with the video projections of Katrina Neiburg and Andra Egliš' script will be wooded in three small pudus in a wide three-hectare square.
By singing Laimas Ice, Dinars Rudjanes and Zigmar Graš, they will come into romantic relations, just as a natural scientist in the study of the lighting age of Swedish natural scientist Kārļa Linnje in the Woods of the Woods (1729).

Reid claims that if Clinton is elected President, he will elect Garland as Judge of the Supreme Court .
The leader of the Senate Democratic Party, Harry Reids, is convinced that if she becomes president, she will appoint Mariku Garland as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The Senate Republican Party has blocked Garland's approval since March when President Obama appointed it.
The Senate's majority leader, Mich Maconnel, said that the next president would choose to replace the current Supreme Court judge, Antonine Skalius.
On Thursday during his conference, Reids announced that it was certain that Clinton would choose Garland.
Reida’s representative later said that he had not personally talked about this subject with Clinton and that they were merely speculations.
He congratulated Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to take a boat with another choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. District Court of Appeal.
Mr Reid said that the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are 'entities' and are acting in the interests of the candidate Donald Tramp, president of the Republican Party.
He also stated that Trump was not fit for the work of the President.

Greenland shark is the most living backbone - video review

The French court rejects the requirement to destroy shops in the jungle refugee camp.
The French court rejected the request of the authorities to destroy dozens of self-constructed shops and restaurants in the "Junglu" camp, where several thousand refugees live.
At the court hearing this week in Kali, the authorities indicated that the country should cut down 72 self-made shops where people market various goods, such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdresser services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for some euro self-made restaurants.
The Prefect’s Office pointed out that these self-developed companies had to be cut off because they constitute a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as create fire and health risks.
The representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small companies are important because the food provided by government and support groups does not provide for the needs of a camp where the population continues to grow.
They also pointed out that self-made shops and restaurants often offer free meals and food to those who need it most.
The Court held that there was no legal basis for dismissing the people who had created 72 self-made shops, but that it understood the concerns of the Prefect.
Justice Jean-Français Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply providing food for people who live in "extremely uncomfortable conditions".
He pointed out that these places are peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of extinction is the Jungle Book Kids camp, which provides more than 200 free meals a day, the English and French language activities and provides advice on asylum issues to hundreds of unprotected minors without adult assistance.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition for the protection of the children’s cafe.

Fiji demonstrated masterclasses in the management of the bomb, the bombs played with the foot, support in the game and brutal force in the game, chasing gold - the first Olympic medal in its history.
Saków presented a prize of peace - a silver medal that was then the third medal in Britain. The UK election can be proud of its achievements in the first Olympic Regency-7 tournament in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A heavy semifinal in which the Boks team suffered with the result 7:5 on the first half of the day, possibly played for Britain at the end.
But in any case, Fiji's choice is now in its best form to also win the 15 men's team.
Although it is unlikely, a certain settlement for the United Kingdom could be the fact that at least one British got a gold medal. This is Fiji's main selection coach Ben Rains - the former English coach from Vimbldon.
Britain had an exciting experience.
Eight years ago, under Raine's leadership, they lost all the games in the 7 series stage in Adelaide.
This time they just lost one game.
Swelling is painful, but growth is amazing.
Fiji began a cat with a great deal of joy in the pursuit of British forces.
Captain Tom Mitchell and the members of the team were meeting with a number of buses and the World Series champions at 5:0 when Osea Kolinisus won the first round.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai has also increased his influence even more by making a move in the right direction.
Result 12:0 and the British team had not even really touched the bomb.
Michela's great strength did not allow the typical Leon Nakaravi to get three points, but it only slightly affected Fiji's results.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua gained a right-hand landing, strengthening the UK's balance to 17:0.
After the overpowering, Nakarava was even more overweight and had remained more than a minute... at the end of the first half-time.
Vatemo Ravou was avoided by some inefficient British forces and crossed the line by winning points.
The landing provided the result at 29:0.
It seemed that Fiji was born to play regbia-7 in the match while the British were just learning.
Actually, that's also true.
The British team made fundamental changes in half-time, reviewing Fiji's line of players... full of four minutes, which by the first half-time standards was good, until Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic team's victory, gained a few more points for Fiji's team.
Den Norton managed to get points for the British team by landing at the left corner and reaching the score 36:7, but the game had already been lost, while the fans of the South Sea salinaries sang, approached the flags and danced in the courts.
Fiji’s life - giving attitude cannot be admired.
Mata William made Fiji's victory even more sweet with another downfall in the end of the game.
When the game was over, Fiji could start celebrating, but the British could only sit in the hall after the crash.
On the first half of the day, semi-final Fiji conquered Japan with 20-5, while the British were too much than South Africa, where in a very intense struggle both teams were on the ground and South Africa lost only a few points.
In the first half of the year, Kyle Brown took the lead in the Boks team, but in the second half of the year, Den Norton crossed the line and delivered a bomb between the poles to win the British.
Markus Vatson, a brother of the 15th English team player Antony, provided the team with a win and another silver medal at the end of the game.
Trainer's fight against cancer inspired Helen Glover and Heteri Stanning in the airing competitions.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in these contests and it already says a lot.
From the first to the last cancer, Helen Gloves and Heteres Stannings had a special role on the Estacio da Lagoa route.
Although there are only two sportsmen on board, she was accompanied by Robin Williams' support, which inspired her to the second Olympic gold medal in the women's fertilization, becoming the first women in the British history to succeed.
She was undoubtedly dominated, for on the 39th time she won an unprecedented victory.
Both great athletes with a swimming elegance slide across the water surface do not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind each gold medal, there is a whole team that works hard to keep athletes constantly improving their performance and making the most of their contribution to their success by a coach who did not know or experience this day 30 months ago because he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had urinary bladder cancer, which is one of those that can operate, and so did it.
If I didn't, it would spread across the body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It's a bit of a change in your vision.
Viljam cancer was discovered in December 2013.
The three concluded that William could have started the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 interim season and reduced the duration of the interruption to a minimum if that could be said.
I needed income, so I needed to recover quickly.
It stimulated recovery.
I was in the hospital, and I got 6, 10 and even 15 meters long, although the doctor said that I would have to take some steps.
It all started.
Airing itself is a challenge, but this time it was even bigger.
After winning, the first thought was about Williams, who was very concerned all morning and spoke more than usual in the excitement.
Stanninga, who served in the Royal Artillery unit in Afghanistan, said, "This was an emotionally difficult week, but it means a lot to me."
It just confirms how much that means to us and how much I, Helen and Robin have worked.
The three years spent with Helen and Robin have been wonderful.
Without Robin we would have achieved nothing, so thank him immensely, he's the best coach in the world.
I can't imagine a better training fellow or a better trainer.
Helen Glovere and Heteres Stanning have not lost in any competitions within five years.
The pair achieves such a huge speed that a competitor cannot compete with.
Even the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to get close, Stannings and Gloves were too large.
We felt every moment.
Helen's clyde: "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It is really important not to lose concentration.
We had a good start, but at the same time, we had no hope.
On that day, we did not intend to throw up the records, but we simply did well to fly and win the competitions, and so did we.
A few years will rest to decide what to do next.
The following month will be the wedding of the applicant for Gloves and TV experiences of Steve Bashal.
In the meantime, she simply wants to enjoy a moment.
I didn't mean to say that these were my last game.
It would have been too much pressure.
In London, I needed about six months to understand that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very upset.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "The feeling is fantastic."

The Collegiate VID will "go to the last" in the position of the driver.
According to him, now Prime Minister Māri Kučinski (Green and Agricultural Union) and Minister of Finance Dani Reizniecei-Ozolai (Green and Agricultural Union) are already "primarily important" for the candidates headed by the Minister of Finance to be approved by the VID as Head.
Rayevskis estimates that both Kučinski and Reizniecei-Ozolai in this government approval of the VID leader is "the first major decision", which can affect him as a politician's future.
If the position of the VID leader is now changing, it will have a negative impact on the government of their immutation.
The next week's agenda of the Cabinet of Ministers includes the question of the transfer of the head of the VVD to the VID Director-General, the government's agenda.
Mr Reizniece-Ozola, Minister of Finance, took the office of Head of the Collegiate VID after he withdrew from the service management of Inara Peterson and the competition for the post of Director-General of the VID ended with no result.
On Thursday, 11 August, during an interview with the Head of the VID, Dace Pelēk allowed the Latvian Radio - if she offered to run for the manager's office, she could agree.
The Minister of Finance also later admitted that there were no other candidates for the VID leader's office at the moment.
The Head of the Saeima Group of the National Association, Raivis Dzintars, also acknowledged that the NA is still supporting Kolügov VID.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing the budget deficit is a threat to the failure to set up a government.
On 12 July the European Commission (EC) concluded that Spain and Portugal did not take sufficient measures to reduce the deficit to 3% of the total domestic product (GDP) required by the euro area.
The calculations show that, despite the savings measures implemented, the Portuguese budget deficit at the end of last year was 4.4% of GDP, and in Spain 5.1%.
However, the European Commission decided not to apply economic sanctions to both countries, at the same time setting fiscal targets for the next period.
One of the reasons why the EC did not impose sanctions on the two countries is increasing Euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only increase such a negative outlook.
Critics point out that the EC does not consistently agree on uniform rules in its decisions and then fail to apply them in life.
Thus, for example, German President Jens Weidmann pointed out that Europe thus loses its confidence in creating an idea in its citizens that the European Union rules are recommendable, not binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States have approved extending the budget deficit settlement deadline by the end of this year for Portugal and by 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission promises to examine the progress achieved by both countries within the coming months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be ready to introduce additional savings measures if conditions so require.
The initial forecasts show that Portugal's target could be achieved at a given time and the budget deficit could already fall to 2.5% of the total domestic product this year.
This means that, within the framework of the Stability Programme, this country's government needs to implement savings measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in the budget for this year, paying further attention to the control of the costs of purchases of goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complex.
This year's budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year - to 3.1% and in 2018 - to 2.2% of GDP.
In addition, the consolidation measures for the next two years should be 0.5% of GDP annually.
The fact that Spain's political parties have not been able to agree on the establishment of a government for eight months makes it particularly difficult to achieve these objectives, and it is becoming increasingly possible for Spain to have a third time in the year to hold the early parliamentary elections.
However, public opinion polls show that the third-election political scene in the country would not change significantly.
The most popular party is still the current Prime Minister Mariano Rahoy, a nation-led party whose elections will again receive a 33% vote.
Its popularity has increased a little only by socialists, while the popularity of the Podemos and the Ciudads or Pilsons has decreased slightly against the rescue measures.
The People's Party wants to get socialist and "Ciudadans" involved in the government this month, otherwise it will not succeed until mid-October to adopt and submit to the European Commission for approval of the 2017 budget.
As the representative of the People's Party's Parliamentary Group, Rafael Hernando, has announced, if the government is not successful and Parliament's elections will be held for the third time, Spain will become all European ridiculers.
The purity of the floodwaters in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
During the fifth year of the survey of beaches, activists concluded that unfortunately, the number of found wastes has increased annually, and this is where most visitors are guilty of swimming.
The most contaminated bathing grounds are directly in Riga.
In the mind of the capital, it is clear that bathing places are expensive every day, but fighting against unclean visitors is a challenge.
In addition, waste left in the dry land can be drained into water during rainstorms, thereby significantly improving its quality.
Except for Liepaja beaches and separate places in Kurzeme, beach cleanliness elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
This communication has been distributed this week by the volunteers of the campaign "My Sea".
At the foot of the fifth year of the road along the Riga Sea, the activists concluded that the number of waste left by the population has increased every 100 metres.
Unfortunately, this year's critical assessment has come to an end.
"We see that this will be a year when the number of wastes per 100 metres per beach may be more than 200 units," said the representative of the expedition "My Sea" Janis Ulme.
The Latvian Radio called, he was located on the Tuva beach, where he will continue his volunteer journey along the Riga Sea.
This year, even day - to - day lights left in the sand have been collected between various household wastes and picnics.
The tour operator and organizer Ulme said that people are responsible for pollution.
"The main source is the beach visitors themselves, because more than half of the total waste is plastic, different waste, starting with bags, plastic pieces that are already in the decomposition phase, they can no longer be identified, and smokers, bottles, corks," says Ulme.
Among the cleanest beaches there are also bathing places in Riga.
For example, in Daugavgrīva, on average, nearly 800 waste units are collected every 100 meters, which are critical.
The organizers of the campaign also make it clear that every step has been taken by smoking and not by all the signs of warning or ban.
"The large figures for all three Riga swimming pools together - Daugavgrīva, Vacabulļi and Vecáči - unfortunately meet a large and far above the desired target, which, like Latvia, is moving, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020", the environmental defender concludes.
Cleaning of bathing sites in Riga every day, during the hottest days of summer, even twice, clear thought representative Ugis Viduskis.
However, the fight against unclean visitors is very difficult.
We return to the cultural issue of these people.
"For those who mix, use alcohol, smoke and do all the things that must not, even special signs, not work," Viduusskis says.
Vidauskis therefore calls for the bathing visitors to report to the police as well.
You can call the police, safely point to these violations and thus fight everyone.
Perhaps new warnings can be imposed, but as I said, there is a lot or something that will change the situation radically.
"As all must simply act together and be impatient against such offenders," he stresses.
In the meantime, water quality measurements have already been carried out for the fourth time this summer, which may prohibit official bathing sites.
This year, as in other years, water quality has always been good and satisfying.
The situation is that in all 56 bathing areas, water quality has always been good and there is no restriction on bathing.
"For the last time we will take the analysis at the end of August," says the senior environmental specialist Norman Cadís.
The waste left on the ground may be drained into water during heavy rainfalls.
This, in turn, can affect its quality, says an environmental expert.
The rotations in the Russian elite will continue - change the manager in Putin administration.
You're out of office?
Vladimir Putin told the Russian media that Sergei Ivanov would abandon this post himself and will continue to be the President's special representative in the field of natural protection, environmental and transport.
Speaking of the changes, Putin's television camera dedicated Ivanova's words of appreciation: "The valued Sergei Borisovich, we have worked together with you for many years and we do it successfully."
I am satisfied with how you fulfill your duties entrusted to you.
I am well aware of our agreement without using you as the head of this President's administration for more than four years.
That is why I will act with understanding against your desire to change the field of activity.
And I hope that you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience in your new role.
However, management of the President's administration is highlighted as a very important role and made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
Considering that the elections of the State Council are expected in Russia next month, there have been rumors that this step is linked to the fight for power in the political elite of Russia.
Ivanov was also referred to as the potential Vice-President of Putina, and the claim that he himself wanted to take office as President's representative in the field of natural protection and transport has led to doubts.
As the Lsm.lv archive shows, Ivanov is the head of the VDK and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been a sensible and close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He began his journey in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
On the other hand, the first Russian President Boris Jelcina was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council at the end of his reign.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, Ivanova's "Information Security Doctrine" was approved, which included the restoration of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001 Sergei Ivanov became Russian Defence Minister, but in 2005 he was the Deputy Prime Minister of Prime Minister Mihaila Fradkova and was responsible for the development and export of weapons by Russian defence companies.
Now, following the resignation of the President's Head of Administration, Ivanov will also remain in the Russian National Security Council, where the new President's Head of Administration will also work.
Vaino comes from family councils in the elite party.
Ivanov himself recommended that he be the head of the administration.
Anton Eduardoovic and I have been known for years.
From the time we worked in your government.
And for the past almost five years, we have been contacted practically every day.
"That is why I am convinced that, according to all the professional and personal characteristics, he is ready for this work," Ivanov said.
Vaino comes from a family belonging to a council party elite.
His grandfather Karl received high office in the Communist Party of Estonia, including his first secretary until 1988.
The Internet edition of "Meduza" with reference to the book "self-determination and independence of Estonia" says that at the end of the 1980s Karl Vaino was asked to allow Moscow to use force against demonstrators.
However, he was rejected and soon lost his position.
Soon thereafter, Vaino has moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino has graduated from Moscow International Relations Institute and manages the Japanese language.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the management of the President's protocol.
It has already been reported that in recent weeks Russia has been harassed by the resignation of several high-ranking officials and even arrests, including the replacement of several district governors and federal representatives.
According to the politician, President Vladimir Putins changes the ruling elite before the 2018 elections.
One of the main features is the increasingly leading role of the representatives of the bodies of the forces.
Nikiforenko also loses its sparkle in the first battle of the Olympics.
This was the first round of the fight, and Latvia's jumbo bat has ended its participation in the Olympics by finishing at 17th place.
Coach Olīg Baskin admitted to Latvia's TV that the Nikiforenko's hope was very low, and it was already clear before the competitions.
He also discovered that the twins in the battle had a shoulder trauma.
Significantly, to get to the Olympics, Nikiforenko had to start in a weight category other than a weight category, i.e., in a weight category up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani battalion was more than 20 pounds [25 kg] in weight.
It has already been reported that in the battle category, Jevgenijs Borodakko held up to 100 kilograms against Rjunosuki for two minutes until the opponent issued a valid year of pure victory.
Therefore, the Latvian Jujudo competition in Rio is over.
The snakes disappear in Rio's sand.
On Thursday, Jvgenius Borodakko was introduced.
Yes, he had a more titrated opponent, but ambition can sometimes cause surprise.
He didn't do anything.
Artur Nikiforenko’s task was even more complex, as experience is less and the opponent is also respectful.
The result is similar, though on the tatami he held tea for half a minute longer than Borodakko.
Regrettably, in recent years, Latvian judiers have been the most ambitious.
Since the Federation's leadership, Gunars Ühres and his financial staff, Vladimir Šestakovs, took off from Latvia, Aleksandr Jackevich, no longer takes place "Golden Score", - the judo's development runs down the slope.
Jackevich, who here consults Kazakhstan's Jewess, and Vsevoldam Zelloni doesn't see the property.
But if he doesn't grow up, he won't.
And it's the federation's prerogative.
Therefore, as from the other galaxy in the "Rite panorama", the promise of the President of the Latvian Judo Federation to beat the medals was scanning.
A flight far from reality.
In the evening with impatience and concern, we waited for the beach volleyball cat Samilovs/Smēdīņš - Evandra/Pedru Solbergs.
Intrigue as already in the "death" group - the loss of the game ended.
The Latvian duet had a slight deviation - it could also be lost, but not more than four points in two sets.
The tension has increased further in the past.
No one wanted to die - this feeling over the wind-card boiled all over the sword.
To the players, the Brassman wind caused additional difficulties.
At first, it seemed that it could be ours - which is the greatest - community.
But it didn't.
Against the Latvian duet to play here was quite simple.
He'll wait for Samilovu to break up.
It was against Canada, against Cuba at the end of the first set, and at the beginning of the third, because the load was not by any means.
At the time, he was able to fish because the work was small, but when he was there, he did so with honor.
The Brazilian Samilovs and Šmēdinus were able to win in two sets, because in the first they took over with 16:15, but on 16 they also remained, exposing the limit of lost points.
But it could also be lost with 0:2, because the second set deficit was -4, however, also thanks to the wind, managed to win.
The third began the Gospel account.
A chain formed - unconvincingly taken servant, the second attachment often flies too close to the network and Samilova has left little option for a successful attack.
If there was a foreign Samilov in the Cuban field, this time he acted more successfully and only to return the loss to Sami would be unprofessional.
Kreil also made a mistake, and quite symbolically, that the last bomb block hit him directly.
We're losing the team.
There was no success this time, however, in the third set only two Evangelical attacks almost flew out of the card, but the bomb hit the line.
Two wheels were next to the line.
The disputed episode also included the benefit of the opponents.
If the first two games taught the Gospel with servants, they were very productive to us.
All total losses on the table.
The causes of failure must now be properly analysed.
Perhaps like many living next to the stadium, not with the delegation in the Olympic village.
It's been two hours.
Perhaps a little self-conference led to a series of seven semi-finals.
Maybe Klagenfurt should not play, but rather get here and better acclimatize.
Perhaps there was a mistake in finding the surface of the sport.
Let's wait for a question more than an answer.
Our racing games are over.
The dream of the medals is over.
What's next?
There are still some World Cup tournaments and also Jūrmala's "Masters".
The meeting with Samilolu has never been and will never be, because there are too many personalities.
But that's not necessary either.
When the dream of the Olympic medals is broken, it can also be thought of separation because the blame will be sought not only for itself but also for the partner.
It is not difficult to decide, but much more difficult in Latvia will be to find a decent partner.
Both brothers are playing the game, but John and Tom have already tried and divorced, while Michael Samoilov is still too green to start picking up the tops of the world.
You can try Harald Regg, Alexander Solovey, Edgar Toc, to return to Martin Plaviņ, but it will not be better than this option, which did not once prove itself in World Cup stages.
This time, they were not mocked by the Kopacaba sand.
A certain one.
Of course, the fact that the beach volleyball is becoming more popular also takes into account the new pair, and only the rare growth is less than two meters.
It still fails to succeed, but there is an important argument in the fight for victory.
Ours doesn't stay longer.
Both sportsmen and journalists have the opportunity to wet in the places offered by the players, as well as to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball election lives on a cruise ship, but the tennis player does not stay in the Olympic village.
Also, some of the beach volleyballists have found a hotel in Kopacaba.
This time, high prices were demanded for journalists for all decent accommodation.
That's why the choice also fell on the rent of the apartment.
The risk is because sometimes they can be uncomfortable from the point of view of logistics.
This time the risk is justified.
Along with Vladimir Vladimirovic, we rent apartments on the Kopacaba and Ipanema border.
The beach is 200 metres away, half an hour away.
The area is quite safe, because the favela is sick, but it must not be lost there.
Vladimir Vladimirovic is not what some people think immediately, but the most professional sports journalist in Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. It seems that on Friday morning another medal dream was dried up.
100 meters in the barber and high jump Laura Ikauniece-Admidini's retreat from their personal records.
But there are still five disciplines.
After 10 years of stopping, "Porgys and Besa" scan in Liepaja.
In Latvia, opera "Porgy and Besa" was first studied in the Latvian National Opera in 1973.
Since then, the internationally recognised masterpiece has not been brought back.
That is why the organizers of the Cēsu Art Festival and Liepaja Art Forum decided in close cooperation to provide listeners with the opportunity to enjoy George Géršvina’s masterpiece.
"We are very pleased that after a ten-year break when Liepāja was last able to enjoy the opera presentation, this excellent version of George Gøršvina's concert studio "Pragy and Besa" is delighted with us at the new, new concert "Great Dintars", says the concert hall "Great Dintars" Head of the Baiba God.
Opera "Porgys and Besa" is a story of love, its incontinence, hostility, as well as family tragedies and simple daily joys.
It reflects African American vitality, music and rhythm.
It is precisely this lack of political correction in this operation that the exclusion of tolerance makes it so alive.
"And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and in some way really deep," says director Viesturs Kairis.
What I like most - listening to or playing this opera, there are always such stop points - famous melodies, famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another by lighting one character or another character, or choirs, or orchestras.
"It is the most exciting, this building", the opera is appreciated by the music director and director Andris Poga of the Paris and Besa concert studio.
Opera visitors agree that this is a great event.
They are delighted to hear this world’s famous Gürschwine opera.
Happy is the world’s spirit in Liepaya.
"Performance professional", the opera is appreciated by the visitor Edgars Lams.
The concert studio was special because in the newly opened concert hall "The Great Gintars" played the orchestra for the first time in the orchestra and for the first time performed the opera concert.
The restored buildings of the Museum of Art could be named on behalf of Jana Rozental.
Riga Vice-Chairman Andris of the American Year of Jubilee announced that the museum's own address in the future could also be not the 10a Street of Krishny Valdemar, but Jana Rosental's field 1.
The Museum's Director, Māra Láce, acknowledged that the re-registration of the address would create a rigid bureaucratic burden, but generally this idea is appreciated and therefore agreed to the municipal proposal.
The main stone of the city of Riga has been laid to this idea in 1936 by setting up the monument of Burcarda Jean to Janim Rozental, who stands at the museum.
The then director of the museum, Wilhelm Purvits, was one of the initiators for the creation of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be quite logical.
I don't get a little bit of a heart-broken all the time - but Wilhelm Purvitis, where are we going to leave his name?!
"But, if you, Mr. America, take your advice" said Lace.
It was reported that the National Museum of Art was officially viewed by the National Museum after extensive reconstruction and modernisation of its doors this May.
This weekend will finally begin the reconstruction of the VEF Culture Castle.
The capital for approximately 11 million euros has been renewed by SIA "Velve".
It is planned to renovate several castles, including two viewers’ medicines, as well as to adapt the building to people with movement disorders.
The Council of Riga intends to attract six million euros of the European Union funds to the project, but the Director of the Riga Council's Property Department, Oleg Burovs, recognizes that the European funds for the project are not yet fully available.
"Despite the political will to initiate the restoration of the VEF culture pillar by attracting European Structural Funds, it is, for months we expect a decision, a real action from the officials of the Ministry of Finance, whether or not it will be granted," Burovs said.
Last December, we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that you make your own decision that Brussels is not taking a decision here.
Now we see another round of discussion being formed, then we will see what we can expect in the next few days.
"I want to say that Riga's mind no doubt guarantees that this process will be started and completed in time," Burovs points out.
It has already been reported that more than a year before, in March 2015, the VEF Culture Castle collectively held an opening concert before the immediate renovation of the building.
Although the year had passed, the renovation of the building had not yet begun and the work had been carried on collectively under inappropriate conditions.
The strategy of the Department of Property of Riga The renovation of the cultural castle of the VEF is divided into apparently independent reconstruction works, each of which will ensure the implementation of the different functions of the castle.
The first is to increase access to the cultural castle of VEF and improve the area.
It aims to organize environments and engineering communications and to restore the facades of the building.
Second - Improving the supply of cultural services to VEF.
It plans to improve the study of interiors, walls and ceiling restorations, theatres and sound records, as well as to arrange internal engineering communications for buildings.
Third - Improving the collective working conditions of creative amateurs, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary, the legendary handcuffs can be seen at the exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will feature various "Līvus" features - photographs arranged on a time line to reflect the group's activities from the beginning to the year 2010 when the group's end is announced.
The participants' audience's clothes, musical instruments, awards and concerts, as well as other things not yet seen for the wider audience, which reflected the activities of the "Līvi" group.
The exhibition will be supplemented with the objects of the Liepaja Museum.
The visual representation of the exhibition was made in cooperation with fashion artist and painter Elitis Patmalniecis.
The musicians who were associated with the "Live" group and their relatives also responded to the call and shared with both objects and memories.
The beginnings of "Livu" are sought in 1972 when a vocal instrumental assembly led by Juris Pavitol is set up in Liepaja's cultural house.
In 1972 and 1974, the Assembly participated in the festival "Liepājas dintars" as well as in the sights of cities and republics.
In 1976, when Juris Pavitol met with Eric Chiigeli and the Metalurgy Culture Palace, he set up a group to join Ingrid Gutmani, Andri Krūzyņi and Jani Grodum.
Over the years, the composition of the group has not occurred once.
Participants have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
However, the main thing - the desire to confirm that Latvian hand music is able to live and exist - has remained unchanged.
"What to see without a lack - ginned, matatine and bardani, these boys felt different from the general style of the musical song ", according to music viewer Klass Vávere.
In a group without the above-mentioned musicians such as Igo, Vilnius Krieviņš, Modris Sterns, Valdis Starks, Laimis Racenniker, Teleis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Bríze, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Thomas Kleins and many others.
The entrance to the exhibition was free of charge.
The exhibition is held from 19 August to 30 October.
On the other hand, on 27th of July, the festival "Līvi" will take place in the concert hall of Liepaja "Pūt, wind" for 40 years of celebration "LīVIfest 2".

This is the highest indicator since 2012 and the first indicator above zero since October when it was positive (0.2%).
The average annual inflation after PCI in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous year was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to the previous year was 101.9% and the average monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year, inflation rates were -0.2% (July 2016 compared to December 2015) and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.

Zbignev Stankevich: The time is coming, and the truth is on the way.
The Archbishop of the Catholic Church of Latvia, Zbignev Stankevich, in his interview, stressed to the Independent that if we want to gain life, we must put the Gospel message in its centre.
For the power of the truth is greater than that of the wicked one.
Many are already on their way to the Most Holy New Mary’s reception feasts in Aglono.
What message will faithful ones receive in this year?
In recent years, the desire to lead the main worship in Aglono has been expressed by the papyrus cha·meiʹa.
Thus, the main message is also in his mind.
It is also about the tradition of the crusader of the road, John Bull.
He will make his own message.
Last day, I led the services of the Vigilance of Christmas.
Last year I turned to the French encyclical "Laudato si" and updated the common house in it, the theme of the Earth in the context of Latvia.
This year... of course, I've seen what's happening in the world, and I'm trying to respond in my speech.
My approach coincides with the church’s recommendation that the Gospel message be placed in the center of life.
It should be shown that the Gospel is the answer to some of the most painful problems in human life and that it inspires him further.
Then it speaks to people.
But Cesius, in the Lamp discussion, you said that "he returns to the understanding of the whole human being."
What do you understand?
Does this mean that people turn away from the church’s message?
And does the church have such a return resource today?
In the capital of India, a man dying on the side of the road.
No one in the capital of India is aware of a man dying on the side of the road - it turns out he's been lying on the side of the road for an hour and then he's gone, the BBC informs.
It has been reported that a man who was identified as Matthew traveled day by day with a rich man, but at night he worked as a guard.
Matthew 5:30 from the morning went home on the road, when he lost him a light car.
The surveillance camera records indicate that the driver was out of the car to look at the victim and then left.
After an hour when no one was left to know about the bleeding man, a mob surrounded him.
About 90 minutes after the accident, the police arrived and the victim was taken to a hospital where he died of the injuries he suffered.
In return for his candidacy to the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID), the Head of the State Environment Service, Inga Kolīgova, welcomed the government from falling, is considered by Professor Oārs Skudra, Associated with the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia.
Collegiate explanation of the withdrawal of the candidacy in connection with the clashing coalition is linked to the fact that it has prevented the government from falling.
In a conversation with the agency, Leta said that he had difficulty in thinking that next week at the government meeting, he would support Kolügov's candidacy.
Therefore, if the Ministers of the Unit voted against, but Kolegovu had so confirmed, it would lead to the government's resignation.
The expert also considers that, before the notice on the withdrawal of the candidacy, Kolígova has consulted both Finance Minister Danu Reiznieci-Ozola and Prime Minister Māri Kučinski.
At the same time, it is also the accession of the "Unity", which strongly opposed her candidacy.
When predicting whether a candidate will be able to find an appropriate candidate through a tender, Skudra acknowledged that there are two options - either a compromise figure will be chosen, or the institution as the executive director of the Director-General will continue to run in Dace Pelēk.
At the same time, he points out - if the Minister of Finance has so far claimed that another candidacy is not being examined, it is home to Peläkay that he must not participate in the competition.
LETA has already announced that the head of the State Environment Service, Kolügova, has decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Director-General of the VID.
Due to the "Unity" opposition, the government remained in the office of Director-General of the VID for a week on Tuesday.
After the government’s decision to postpone the decision, Kolegova confirmed that he was still ready to become a VID leader.
However, he later changed his mind - on Friday, in his submission to Finance Minister Dan Reizniecei-Ozolai, he indicated that he withdrew his consent to transfer to the VID manager's office and that she did not have an easy choice.
Prime Minister Māra Kučinska's press secretary Andrejs Vavars explained to the agency that a new competition would be held for the VID Director-General.
There was an accident in the centre of Riga involving a police car.
A road accident involving a State police car took place in the centre of Riga this afternoon.
The police car with the sound and light signals on it will rush to the highest category call, until Krišijana Barona and Dzirnav have crossed the street with another car.
The police explain the circumstances, but the initial information shows that the second force has not been launched for a long time by the police car.
In an accident, a woman suffered.
This year the population of Riga collapses
At the beginning of this year, 638 784 people in Riga were 0,34% less than in 2015 when 641,000 people were officially registered in the capital, LETA informed the Central Statistical Office (CSP).
On the other hand, in terms of population, the capital of Latvia takes place in 30th place between the capitals of the European Union (EU) and the major cities in which the population exceeds one million.
According to data from the EU statistical office "Eurostat" in Riga, the highest proportion of women is - Latvia's capital is in the first place among the largest European cities with 127 women per 100 men.
In all three Baltic capitals, the highest proportion of women in Europe's largest cities is 123 in Vilnius, while in Tallinn 121 women per 100 men.
A warning icon at the LNMM location.
In the next few days at the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM) the warning signs will be displayed - pictograms, LETA told the agency, the representative of the Department of Property of Riga Council, Baiba Gailite.
At present, the restoration of glass-speed damage to the museum has been successful as a result of the operation of the shingleboardists.
Warning pictograms will be displayed in the next few days.
They will tell the public that the roof is often snowy and snowy, and must not be moved by cars, as well as by bicycles, slippers and slippers.
On that social network, Facebook was also written by Usakov, who pointed out that no security threats would cause damage, but "seems to be incurred", and the barbers would "be able to heal".
Celebrations for children and parents - New children's playgrounds in Riga.
During this summer season, the Riga municipality has set up even two new playgrounds in the city, Kipsala and Chiekurkal, which are already available for children.
On Kipsala beach, a large, multifunctional toy with various elements, bridges, games, pipes and ski lifts is installed.
The playground is for children of all ages.
The field also includes hoses and various balancing elements.
The fantasy world for small ships is spreading the attraction on the Daugavas coast with a view to the passenger port and the cruise ships visible there.
On the other hand, in the playground between Čiekurkalna 4 and 5 cross-sections, the game house, the boot, the stage track, the balance bridge, the drums, the toys and other elements of the game, as well as the exercise area with rings of force and coordination trains, accessories etc.
Down the field included rubber cover in different colors.
A new, colourful board cover is included on the side of the street to the playground.
In honey, the reconstructed stage of the road was discovered.
Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, the management of VAS Latvian State Roads (LVC) as well as the representatives of the construction company SIA Binders and municipal representatives today discovered the Russian border of the reconstructed main road (Grebnjeva) -Rēzekne-Daugavpils-Lithuania border (Medumi) (A13) step from the Medjum to the border of Lithuania (156.4.163.05. km).
The roads are a national tourist map, especially border roads, so it is a special pleasure to discover a reconstructed stage on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the improvement of the situation on national highways through co-financing of the European Union funds.
"As the forecasts show, the means available for roads during this planning period will be available in 2018, and we need to think about how to continue maintaining the most difficult roads in very good quality, and also to ensure the mobility of the population in all regions of Latvia without European Union funding," said Uldis Augulis, turning the symbol board.
The Minister of Transport also pointed out that proposals made by road experts on sustainable financing for the roads of Latvia will be presented to the government in the near future.
During the construction phase from Medjugorje to the border of Lithuania (156.4.163.5 km) SIA Binders started yesterday and this year continued after technological interruption.
The cost of reconstruction is EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), which was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"The reconstructed road phase has completely renovated the road structure and the next year will start repairing the next phase from the Medum to Daugavpilij itself, thereby organizing the entire road from the border of Lithuania to Daugavpilij," said LVC Chairman Janis Lange.
The main roads of the country are the most difficult, and by 2018 we are planning to make sure that all the main roads of the country are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, providing periodic maintenance in a timely manner and to change the asphalt surface every 7-9 years.
"There will, of course, be a need for adequate funding, and all travellers with hope will be able to look forward to the proposals made by the expert group for the organisation of the road financing system," Lange noted.
In the framework of the project, road connections and lighting are arranged in the centre of the Medum.
Significant land works have been carried out: during the four stages, large-scale cooling and large-scale storage and storage works, a balanced long-distance profile, which has so far been very uneven.
Public transport is also refurbished and a refurbished turning point for public transport.
Before the roads were not sufficiently insatiable and the areas were not transparent due to mountain cliffs and the old road along the common cliff.
The next construction season is scheduled to renew the road phase from the Daugavpils city border to the reconstruction phase (144,80,156,40 km).
This year LVC plans to carry out various types of work more than 1,100 kilometres of national road.
Information on all repairs planned for the national road network this year is available at LVC website www.lvceli.lv.
"To achieve the desired results of weight reduction, it is very important to choose the right food combinations," acknowledges Lithuanian diethologist Laura Romereite-Kukleriene.
Moreover, it is easy to achieve during the summer period when fresh fruits, berries and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
The combination of foods that are considered can help not only to reduce weight, but also to promote the various processes of the body in a targeted manner.
Macaroni and etiquette are a successful combination because it provides a lasting sense of sweetness and helps to fight fat.
Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that the label has a positive effect on blood glucose levels and helps us to feel our mouths.
Cayenne peppers and protein rich food, such as poultry meat or protein cocktails, creates not only a sweet feeling, but also reduces the appetite after large meals for the next meal.
The combination of such foods can also increase the quantity of calories burned after meals up to 35%.
Studies show that Cayenne’s peppers can help to get rid of fat in the abdominal area.
The egg contains a metabolic food - choline, while pepper is a good source of vitamin C.
Taking sufficient amount of this food can reduce the level of cortisol, thus also the accumulation of fat around the middle of the body.
Gold beet, added to the fresh eggs, has another dish and fat burning meal for breakfasts that are worth entering in your menu.
Oats and oats contain fibers that are controlled by the findings of scientists in Canada - appetite-stimulating hormones - and thus also the sense of hunger.
In addition, the eggs contain polyphenols that are useful for weight reduction and do not allow fat formation.
Plants and proteins are also able to perform miracles in reducing weight.
Such a combination can create a sweet feeling.
Vegetables contain water and fibers, so they promote a sweet feeling.
At the same time, protein slows the digestion process and provides a sweet feeling for a longer time.
During lunch you can eat all the salads or also make protein cocktails from the ready mix and enjoy them along with your favorite gardens.
Avoid any combination of products.
Fruit contains sugar - monosaccharides or dissaccharides - one or two molecules.
On the other hand, the starch in the vegetables is polysaccharide.
The fruit is mechanically divided into the stomach, while the chemical is not split until it reaches the third or fourth degree in the digestion process that occurs in the intestines.
The prison is divided into three different stages that start with the mouth.
Therefore, it is important not to eat frozen food immediately after meals.
Eating sweet food immediately after meals, it is "prostituted" in the stomach with other foods where it is not chemically broken and begins to break.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, cereals, bananas, data or other carbohydrates with lemons, lime, oranges, grapefruit, pineapple or other acidic fruit.
The enzyme ptialine, located in the silica, works only in an alkaline environment.
Fruit acids are not only inhibited by dehydration of carbohydrates, but also contribute to their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or milk and similar protein-rich products for one meal.
The processing of them requires various fertiliser juices, each with different strengths, characteristics and time when the stomach is to be used.
Arbuz, medusmelone, muscatmelone and other melons should always be eaten separately from other meals.
Melons are not crushed if they are in the stomach together with other foods.
Fats in combination with protein-rich products.
Fats are a successful combination of starch, but the same cannot be said of fats and proteins - fats prevent protein contamination.
The proteins can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If a large quantity of protein is consumed, avoid the full use of fat.
It also applies to freshening - it is not recommended to combine large amounts of rice (containing proteins) with whole avocado (satur fats).
This combination prevents effective weight loss.
How better to prepare?
"The preparation of food, heat treatment causes a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the original food ingredients," the diethylologist said.
In most cases, food is lost by boiling in water.
However, the value of some foods increases, directly by heating.
After boiling the remaining liquids, it is recommended to make soup - in this case you will not lose the nutrients left in the water and you will be able to eat them later.
It is recommended to prepare vegetables, including by chewing them.
The thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene contained in tomatoes.
When you store tomatoes for 30 minutes, the amount of lycopene increases by 25%.
The thermal treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of beta-carotene found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, burkina Faso, sweet potatoes and spinach.
The thermal treatment of eggs and meat takes away the natural properties of existing proteins, making them easier to digest.
The thermal treatment of meat and eggs also makes the iron and other mineral substances present in these products easier to absorb.
It should also be borne in mind that freezing products can reduce vitamin C levels from 10% to 90%, although the cooling of the liquid does not affect.
Poultry in combination with tomatoes may increase the intake of iron in the body, which in turn provides better brain and muscle function.
Our body takes up to 33% less non-bloody iron found in plant products such as bees, leaves greens, cereal products than the blood-producing iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and the vista.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-bloody iron in the body by using products containing non-bloody iron with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and eggs.
Vitamin C helps change non-bloody iron so that our body can absorb it more easily.
Iron is required for the production of hemoglobin, which provides oxygen supply in muscles and brains.
To get the maximum benefit from salads, add healthy fats such as olive oil or linseed oil.
When preparing butter with a lass, add vitamin D rich salmon or sardines with a free yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the intestine and has an important role in bone formation.
Gold (as well as other full grain products) along with vitamin C sources, such as soils, hops, veins and other fruits or eggs, helps to stabilize cholesterol levels and to avoid arterial exposure.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticises Asian caricature
Snapchat representatives say that this filter has inspired animation, but some commentators claim it is racistly insensitive.
With this lens effect Snapchat allows 150 million users every day to change the reality and play with their identity completely absurdly.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or an image that would fit Roja Lihštenstein's painting.
The lenses are cloudy, image-misleading instruments that generate more than 30 million self-processed per day.
Any mistake quickly becomes public noticeable.
Snapchat lens effects have already been criticised earlier, getting the impressions that the application popularises too dark or bright face tone as an ideal beauty benchmark.
This week, the new lens effects were published that allow users to create soluble eyes, soluble teeth and round faces, and some critics called it a racist Asian cartoon – "red gums".
It was also asked whether such contradictions did not show that the company had more problems with diversity.
News and public negativity broke out on Wednesday, when the expenditure “The Verge” and “Motherboard” reported that the lens effects were removed from the application.
The company explained that the lens was intended to picture Anime's images, not to caricature people of Asian origin.
However, people who have experienced racism have been reminded of the painful stereotypes.
Others categorically rejected the similarity with Anime.
The entry on images by students of Korean American art from Greece Spapani Twitter obtained a broad resonance. In her e-mail, she indicated that the lens effects were "excitable and uncomfortable to say no more".
She added that it is difficult not to see the apparent similarity between Asian caricatures and lens effects.
This shows that the lens effect is not simply a yellow face, but a yellow face in terms of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has been involved in these cultural laps.
American culture is also involved in an endless fight for diversity and inclusion, from the premises of business meetings to Hollywood and the devices we use every day.
And Snapchat's great young audience, which represents different races, unlike the elderly, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that calls users, then "to this day such things remain undetected", said 25-year-old Katie Jou in a Thursday interview.
On Thursday, the company’s “Medium” product manager Žou will delete his Snapchat application and advise others to do the same.
In her article "Medium" and a telephone interview, she explained that in her opinion, race problems arise because of Snapchat's employment policy, which does not support race diversity enough.
Jou criticised the company’s management, which consists mainly of white men and then concluded his article with reference #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there are no racial differences in the company, so such decisions are allowed. Whether some other race representatives are working in the company, but they do not take a position to be able to express their views safely and comfortably," said American Zhou of Chinese origin.
Her opinion also agrees with others, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not discover how many employees are represented by different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of his employees, but its representative found that the company had compared the staff member, who would focus on representing the company also the racial minorities that were not widely represented and would promote its inclusion.
Zhou, on the other hand, will not update his Snapchat account by adding: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to understand that it's not right."
The Chamber of Congress announces that military officials have reduced reports on the Islamic State.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the Chamber of Congress notes that the US Central Command has narrowed the reports by depicting the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria far more optimistic than is true.
Analysts of the Central Command Investigation Service express general dissatisfaction with the temporary report of the unit of task set up by representatives of the Armed Forces Committee, the Exploration Committee and the Defence Funding Sub-Committee of the Republics, indicating that their management controlled reports on the success of the Americans in the fight against the Islamic State.
The central order, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest information on this report is reported that the survey reports approved by the senior managers of Centcom reflect the US's fight against terrorism more positively than is true.
The representative of the Republic of California, Ken Kalverts, says: "Centcom's actions are unacceptable - our soldiers are the ones who suffer if our policy makers receive false reports."
Centcom management errors are sought by organisations in the highest management.
This 10-page long report details the existing problems in the reflection of the Central Order and analyses the efforts of the Americans to prepare Iraq's forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although this does not provide conclusive evidence that the senior officials of Obama administration had failed to break the reports, it shows that Centcom’s management has put some pressure on analysts to look more optimistic at the threats posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report states that, in the first half of 2015, the Central Management Press Releases, Communications and Reports presented to Congress the situation in a much more positive light than it was in fact.
For example, representatives of Centcom publicly announced that Mosula's recovery operation could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosula is the second largest city in Iraq, still under the control of the Islamic State.
The representative of the Democratic Republic of Kansas, Mike Pompeo, in his report, wrote: "The investigation of several months clearly proves this."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the US Central Management Officers have narrowed the reports, drawing the ISIS threats in Iraq weaker than they really were.
The Republican Party set up a working group to find out that analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic State is being disseminated.
In the course of the investigation, the report published on Thursday will be followed by new findings in this case.
The General Inspectorate of the Ministry of Defence shall conduct an investigation into the activities of the Centcom intelligence department.
The members of the Democratic Party of the Democratic People's Party of Inquiry Management Committee made their own report on Thursday, which they agree with some of the conclusions of the Working Group of the Republican Party.
The representative of the Democrats Adams B. Schifs, in his report, wrote that Centcom was too limited to the preparation of daily survey reports in relation to the ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces from 2014 to 2015.
Mr. Šifa explains that this process "stopped the dissemination of information", made the work of analysts worse, and "extended the facts that are not true."
But the members of the Shefs and Democratic Party added that there is no evidence that the White House has put pressure on Centcom analysts to draw up reports in line with the "pre-defined or political position".
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the congress investigation on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon’s General Inspectorate has initiated an investigation into Centcom’s analyst’s complaints.
The Pentagon representative, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, announced that the Pentagon would not comment on the congress report until the investigation continued.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data in different ways, and the Ministry of Defence and the Research Administration calls for a constructive dialogue on vital issues of national security.
The investigation is not limited to the question of whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement made by more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's accusations raise doubts as to whether President Obama can fully rely on reports from the Central Administration on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot spots.
Criticism of Islamic State Survey recalls more than ten years ago events when Centcom's research analyst, Gregory Höhrer, published a study claiming that the Georgian V. Bush administration started the Afghanistan war, thinking too little of its possible consequences.
Hötter also played a significant role in discovering the issue of Islamic State exploration.
Last year, officials reported that the Höcker team found that, contrary to the public reports, air raids did not significantly worsen the financial situation of the terrorist group because they had built temporary factories to sell oil in the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery did not come outside the central management walls.
At that time, Commander Centcom, General Lloyd Ostin III, received a critical call because many lawmakers felt that the military reports described the situation too positive.
In April, General Ostin took his leave and became General Joseph L. Votels.
In the United States due to British women's field hockey, the U.S. wins, thus winning the fourth round.
The day after the victory over Japan with the result 6:1, on Thursday, Katie Bama won the first two gates of the US women's field hockey team, when the Americans won the Indian team with the result 3:0.
Five gates in two games are unforgettable achievements, but 27 - year - old Bama said that she could not remember what she had ever done.
She said, "I don't have a feeling."
I'm not one of those people who count their gates.
But she knows that the result of the Americans in the Olympics is 4:0, which gives them in their group an indistinguishable with the United Kingdom, which won over Japan on Thursday with the result of 2:0 unweighted.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday to play the last match in the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for a quarter final and the game will only determine which team will take the first place in the group of six teams and which one.
The first winner will be a little longer away from the meeting with the strong Dutch election, which is the leader of the second group.
Although the Saturday game has not been developed, the Americans have already called for a surprising wind, four years ago in London, to take the last place among 12 teams.
That team also had Bama.
She grew up in Bluebel, her first time in her hands at 3 years of age (her older twin sisters had already worked with this type of sport in Drexel) and joined the national election when she was 16 years old, becoming a selection in the history of the latest players.
She was not at the 2008 Olympics because she did not enter the finals.
In 2012, however, she and her team failed.
The next year, Craig Parhams was appointed as a selection coach and everything changed to the right side.
Bama called it "cultural, mental and physical changes."
In London we did not invest as much as we do now.
We have completely changed everything.
On Thursday's game Bama discovered the result, winning doors in the first half-time with a year's back from close distance.
India's game started without winning in its account, but their selection was very smooth and held a minimum result of 0:1 to the end of the third period when Bama regained the gates.
She introduced the bombers into the area on the left side of the field, then noticed to be in the middle of the field and to spread the bombers at the gates, placing them in the direction of the Americans 2:0.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melissa Gonzales had another gate.
This was the first U.S. Warlock Briggs dry game in each of the first three games by entering one gate.
She's gone.
And so is Bama.
"We are going very well now," said Pahams, but how well exactly will the game appear on Saturday.
The most instructive meal of the period of depression is "Satan's Lunch"
In March 1933, shortly after the election of President Franklin Delano Ruzvelts sat in the oval room to stop the meal.
President Ruzvelt enjoyed fine culinary treats such as zosu liver pastes, or fuagre, and Maryland broth soup.
However, his meal was much more accurate at that time: a bottle of eggs filled with tomatoes, potatoes, and flowers in the desert.
Jane Ziegelmane says, "It's a way of solidarity in preparing meals with people who were very difficult."
Her husband, Andrzej Kou, adds, "It's also a message for Americans as to how to eat."
A couple from the Brooklyn Heights area are food historians.
As described in the last book, "Garzenu Sutēžu" is a Chinese kitchen in America, but Ziegelmane describes life through food rental in the eastern part of Manhattan.
Their new joint work "Satan meal," which will be published on Tuesday by Harper, is a story of American food during the Great Depression.
In expressing some solidarity in the kitchen, they stopped the meal together with the reporter "Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop", in a simple lunch table located in the Flatiron area and operated since 1929 when a great depression began.
At 54 years of age, Mrs. Ziegelmane ordered butter with boiled cheese and raspberries, while 57 years old Kou ordered turkeys, potatoes, and vegetable salads.
When the reporter ordered the fake rabbit, a couple recognized that his choice was very suitable for the discussion of the Big Depression meal.
Ms. Ziegelmane said that the fake rabbit was very popular.
There was an earthworm rabbit, a liver rabbit and a bean rabbit.
They were prepared from basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine what it's like to eat so many peanuts that they'll be in lunch.
Mr. Kou has come to terms.
"Shortfully it seemed that the belly was full of lead," he added.
During the pre-depression years, the American lunch table was similar to the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women were prepared to eat their husbands-employers and breakfasts, lunches and dinners were served with freshly prepared spices.
During the first world war, Americans sent food to Europeans. "Satan's meal" is described as adapting Americans to the conditions when America was no longer a land of overcrowdedness.
"At that time the food became the main focus of the people of America's day," said Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write directly on this topic.
Just as important became the new budget diets: food such as counterfeit rabbits and wastes became daily, wastes were "a great way to use surpluses," said Mrs Ziegelmane, as it was possible to hide unattractive ingredients under creamy measures in the spring.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheap dried fruit.
The meat, which for years was the main ingredient of the American meal, now became an extremely rare luxury product.
At a time when the number of calories and the nutritional value of food were more important than taste, the birth was new, not yet seen.
In an ancient manuscript, Mrs. Ziegelmane found a recipe for making strawberries filled with peanut butter.
Mr Kou adds: "It was not a popular lunch table supplement."
Mrs. Ziegelmane stressed, "It was surreal."
The cream butter and the recipe is not compatible.
Many home food recipes were used during difficult times.
Household economists such as Luis Stanley, head of the Federal Household Economics Office from 1923 to 1943, set out national eating habits that were not experienced before or after the Great Depression.
By publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they advised households to become "economicists" and to accept challenges such as turning pasta and burkina Faso mix into a delicious meal.
"St. Maltīte" is a historical beauty lover.
It is particularly interesting to witness the government's attitude towards its starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hüver's "let me eat pork".
Although he publicly told of his simple childhood and eating in Aiove, he actually ate as a fine millionth of what he had become.
Mr Kou says, "He liked European cuisine, for example, fish with gourmet sauce."
He eats in a nearby reddish room, wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely lost in reality.
President Ruzvelt would have made the same mistake unless his wife Eleonora had advised him to set an example with her eating habits.
The book tells us that Ruzvelt would reward the host who did not learn to prepare to eat, and thus the White House became a place "where not only was one of the worst foods in Washington, but also the worst food prepared".
As soon as the country's economy recovers, most of the days of the depression have disappeared.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutrients, as well as to how science is used in cooking, Mrs Ziegelmanes added.
Some say that by writing the book, they gained a greater understanding of Mrs. Ziegelman’s eating habits, such as why she was unable to throw out food.
"She was really afraid to throw out food," said Mr. Kou.
Mrs. Ziegelmanes said, "She actually tricked people."
Sometimes there was an incident with the windshields.
When we had eaten at Eisenberg’s dining table, a couple of writers pulled out of the summer home a prepared dessert: a flower bowl that President Ruzvelt had eaten on lunch.
"It is plumbing," said Mrs. Ziegelmanes, adding that at that time there was the habit of giving the proper name to foods.
It does not contain pudding, only dried plums, a few flours, sugar, water and cinnamon.
All of them impatiently put the caravan in the brown mass that was on the solvents.
Surprisingly, it wasn't that bad.
Mr. Kou ate some more coumas.
Listening to an experienced economist, he said to his wife, "Dear a piece of straw. "
Gilead will receive a refund for legal expenses in the fight against Merck on Hepatitis C patent
The District Justice has decided that "Gliead Sciences Inc." is entitled to recover the expenditure on legal services it has paid in the case of the discharge of Hepatitis C patent against the pharmaceutical company "Merck & Co Inc."
In June, Gilead was justified in the case of 200 million pounds of fines for two Merck patents, which threatened it in connection with the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets, when the U.S. federal judge found irregularities in Mark’s activities, such as lying after a sworn transfer and other non-ethical activities.
At the hearing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Bets Labson Fryman pointed out that Gilead had the right to claim compensation for the legal expenses incurred by it in defending the case.
Merck is trying to get positions on the market against Gilead, which dominates the market with new generations of Hepatitis C medicines that are effective in 90% of liver diseases.
It was already started in 2013, when Gilead and Merck appealed to each other, trying to gain ownership of the newly developed active component sofosbuvir, which is the main component of Gilead medicine.
US-supported forces claim that they have fully taken control of the city of Manbida from the Islamic State.
The US-supported forces have completely taken over the northern part of the city of Manbige at the Turkish border and the last Islamic state soldiers have left the city, the group's representative announced on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are now clearing the city from the last fighters who have not yet left the city.
They have released more than 2,000 civilians-citizens who had been captured by the fighters, Reuters told the news agency Sharfan Darviš of the Manbidja military council of the SDS.
"Now the city is in full control of us and we are searching for fighters," he informed the agency Reuters.
Clinton's income in 2015 amounted to $10.75 million and the couple paid 34.2 percent of the federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton published a 2015 tax statement on Friday, showing that the president of the Democratic Party and her husband have earned $10.75 million this year and have paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent, respectively.
During 2015 Clinton has donated $1 million, mainly to his charity organization. Former President Bill Clinton has earned about $5.3 million in speech as a speaker and former Secretary of State has earned $3 million from his book on work in the State Department, published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton's election partner - US State Senator Tims Keins and his wife Anna Holtone have published their tax statement for the past 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hilaria Clinton and Tims Keins continue to set new financial transparency standards," announced in his statement to the Clinton campaign partner, Jennifer Palmier.
On the other hand, Donald Trumps is hiding behind various insights and objections in order not to be able to meet the promises to disclose his tax information.
The publication of tax information paid is a record practice for the US President's candidates, but it is not required by law.
New York Business Tramps and his lawyers min the National Revenue Service audit as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"Your move", on his Twitter entry, reported on the tax information of the Democratic Party's campaign partner Ians Sams.
On Thursday, Trampa, Special Adviser Michael Kohens told CNN that he would not allow Tramp to publish tax information until the audit has been completed.
Tramp critic, including Mits Romnius and other Republicans, candidate for the president of the 2012 Republican Party, claims that his refusal raises questions about his real estate, the amount of donations and other business obligations, including obligations with Russia.
Clinton lit oil by publishing a video on Friday, where several influential Republicans demand Tramp to publish their tax information.
She returned to this matter during the economic talk in Michigan on Thursday.
She said in her effort: "He refuses to do what the other presidential candidates have done for decades."
Politico reported that during the 1990s Trump had paid very little or no taxes, and on Friday, the New York Times businessman reported that many bookkeepers and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are an important issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, with the support of the billionaire Varena Bafeta proposal, popularizes the idea that each person who earns more than $1 million per year must pay a tax of at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
Last week during Clinton's speech in Omaha, Nebraska, where his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, Bafets invited Trump to exchange tax returns.
Bafets said he was also audited by the Revenue Service and Tramps was afraid of voters, not tax authorities.
The Clinton campaign has published tax information until 2007.
Clinton now lives in Čapakva, New York and has paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014. The total tax rate of approximately 40.5 per cent.
The 2015 Clinton tax report shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund from which Clinton has received $109,000 in dividends.

The director of the Jewish film criticises the Berlin hotel for the closure of Israel's telephone code at an Arab request - RT News
The director of the French films of Jewish origin raised wind in the social media, when he discovered that the "Kempinski Bristol" hotel in Berlin did not have an Israeli telephone code.
Klods Lancmans, a documentary film about the Holocaust director "Shoah", did not hide his discontent with the Berlin Hotel "Kempinski Bristol" and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During a recent visit, Lancman tried to find the list of Israeli telephone codes in the hotel.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel has been slaughtered and destroyed?
Written by Lancmans.
Instead, the "Kempinski Bristol" hotel offers to call this country through its call center.
The Director requested an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancman writes that the answer he received "has shocked him".
The hotel administrator explained that "it was a known hotel management decision".
The reason for the removal of the code was even more interlinked with the film director.
"Most of the guests are Arabic and they asked for the removal of the Israeli code," Lancman quoted the hotel employee's explanation.
Suddeutsche Zeitung reports that the Ambassador of Israel in Germany James Hadas-Handelsman referred to this case as "great shame".
We are surprised and shocked at this incident.
The same is a great shame to yourself.
And the fact that this has happened directly in Germany, it is in this hotel network that there is even more humiliation.
There is no need for comparisons.
The official said, "We hope that the hotel will make the right conclusions."
This event also gained a lot of resonance on the Internet, where people called it scandal.
Others believe that the "Kempinski" hotel has simply been issued to Arab customers.
Another entry said "to beat", indicating that the hotel is located in Kurfurstendamm street next to the synagogue.
The edition Der Spiegel writes that the hotel itself quickly rejected all the concessions, declaring that it was all "understanding" and apologizing to Lancman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of national numbers," Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted Kempinski as saying.
And it adds that the code has been added to the list again.
Police use rubber balls and tear gas against Protestant Brazilian students.
The clash between students and the police took place on Thursday in the city of Sanpaul in Brazil, where the students gathered in demonstrations against the reforms of the government education system.
Police used rubber balls and tear gas against students.
Problems began when law enforcement tried to wipe out students, as a result of which the police used rubber balls and tear gas.
A number of hundreds of students participated in the demonstration to show their disapproval of the reform of the education system.
The proposal by Governor Geraldo Alckmina of Sanpauli is intended to close nearly 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be transferred to other schools with a view to saving funds.
Some demonstrators drew graffiti on the walls with messages against temporary President Michael Temer.
This protest took place only a few days after the previous protest, when the students gathered in demonstrations with the aim of expressing their support to the outgoing President Dilma Rosefa, whose influence was voted against by the Senate.
Scott Kellums Skinners finish first, bringing UK gold medals to the wheel
Kellums Skinners from Scotland finished his first men's racing team in the Rio railway race that took place last night. The British team protected its championship title, which it won in the 2012 London Games.
23-year-old sportsman from Glázgova played an important role in these competitions, making the legendary rock of Ser Krisus Hoi proud and bringing victory to the favorites of New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won an amazing victory when Hoys won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they also repeated it at the World Championship in London, although Hoys had already finished his sports career.
The problems were at a stage between Beijing and London Olympics, as an experienced starter specialist was to be replaced by Jamie Staff.
They got it the last time.
When Hoys left, he tried to fill up on Kians Emadi and Mets Krampton.
British coaches hoped for Skinner, looking at the potential he later demonstrated.
Hindus, Kenya - champions who started four years ago with Hoy and Skinner, who installed the Olympic Qualifications Record, but the best start was for the New Zealand team
However, the British trio won gold medals.
Hindus were hard - pressed, Kenys took the lead, and Skinners took care of it.
The change of strategy played an important role in victory, as Hindus drove with greater transport to allow Kenya and in particular Skinner to drive faster.
Hoys was seen as a BBC representative and caught sights of Skinner, Kenya, and Hindu eye at the time they buried on the throne of honor.
The 23-year-old speaker said, "It was an unforgivable disgrace."
I'm doing my best to defend my name.
We finally set up the Olympics record and won the World Championships.
It was just unbelievable.
There's no better victory.
After winning with Kenya and Hou in the 2012 Olympic Games in London, Hindus admitted that they wanted to fall on the track after a failed start.
He later supported this comment and the British competitors were not able to prove the contrary.
There was no such incident at the time.
The Hindus said: "The flags of the United Kingdom were recalled in the memory of London."
In the last 3 months, we have become a sworn commander.
We have lost so many World Championships, so the victory in the Olympics was truly special.
A medal will be given to a country that has won seven of the ten gold medals in the racing race in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is the indicator of the team's progress over the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
In view of Kenya’s outcome, he could really repeat Hoja’s success by acquiring three Olympic gold medals.
It would mean six gold medals and one gold medal to Kenya. Furthermore, Kenius was born on March 23rd (it seems to be a British holy date because Steve Regreivs, Mo Farahs and Rogers Banisters were born on this day).
Hoys was born on this date.
Kenya's next competitions are split, which starts today and will continue for the next three days.
The 28-year-old sportsman from Bolton said, "Now I'm just enjoying it all.
The team's journey is always the best.
Because then you can win along with your teammates.
If it's fair, then winning one is a little bit lonely."
Hindus said, "If he gets two more gold medals, he should be appointed to the army."
On that day it was the only battle for medals, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bredley Vigins, Eds Klensey, Steve Burkes and Owens Douls showed the fastest qualifying time for four kilometres.
Their time was 3:51,943
The world record that was installed in London in 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and final will take place today in the second half of the day, where Vigins will certainly be in the center of attention.
Yesterday before the qualification trip, he had disagreement with the Commissioner when the judges summoned him to measure his growth.
In the women's journey, which will continue and end today, Laura Trota, Joanna Rovsela Shanda, Elinor Barkere and Katie Archibalda from Milgania set up a new record time of 4:13,260.
The UK delegation hopes that the British wheeling team, hoping to win the medals in the middle of the Olympics.
Remembering the outstanding and unprecedented achievements in Beijing and London, all look forward to the same achievements as Rio.
Meanwhile, behind the scenes are different, after charges of sexism and respect, technical director Sheins Saton has resigned, and the career also ends with Hojs and Victoria Bendleton.
However, starting with the first fierce competitions, Britain is said to have always reached the highest level in the right time.
The future of the Portland vaults becomes unclear as a vast contract is interrupted.
The future of the aluminium tanks and hundreds of its employees in Portland has become unclear in Victoria, as its main customer has notified the energy company of the interruption of the cooperation.
This Communication is based on the Victorian Government's plans to suspend the subsidy of the energy company, which is vital for the company to continue its work.
For 20 years, subsidies will be discontinued in November.
As a result, more than 2000 jobs in Alkoa Portland are at risk.
The risks could be up to 2000 for both direct and indirect jobs.
In addition, it will also have unexpected side effects as the casket consumes about 10 percent of all Victoria's electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the "Point Henry" vault, leading to a break in the operation of the English Power Station.
The Alkoa Portland shed works with losses and can be closed.
These events led to years of speculation about the rise of the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of production of the factory.
The plant's energy supplier "AGL", which supplies energy from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrouba Iele, says that the other three owners will probably also terminate their contracts.
Most of the power plants are owned by Alcoa and Alumia joint ventures, in addition to the company's shares are also owned by China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding companies.
"AGL" is looking forward to the continuation of the operation of the Portland plant, which would mean further energy supply to the basement," said its representative.
‘AGL’ stated that the contracts are so-called ‘risk-restrictive contracts’, which are intended to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month period and will therefore be valid until 2017.
"AGL plans to receive revenue from these contracts also in the fiscal year 2017," said the company representative.
From the fiscal year 2018, the potential impact on profit limits favourable market forecasts for wholesale electricity prices in the future.
"AGL" claims that its forecasts have already calculated losses of $187 million , providing that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa has announced that the decision to terminate contracts will not affect Alcoa's ability to continue to operate or supply energy to it.
The US company announced that in 2010 it had concluded a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years, but it will be terminated in November. The company does not provide explanations why it will cease cooperation.
Analysts have expressed concern about the possible closure of the Portland basement in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the poor economy of the sector.
AGL Executive Director Stevens Mikelson said last week that 600 megawatts and tomago 900 megawatts were spent during Portland's year by analysts.
If both of these plants were to withdraw from the energy market, the demand for energy would be significantly reduced.
And that wouldn't be good at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160 000 people each year.
Every year, more than 160,000 people's demands are rejected, and by reducing the budget, the situation could worsen.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to fight illegal oppression - are denied free legal assistance and representation.
The Community legal centre, which has already been overloaded, warns that reducing funding will only make the situation worse.
From June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than so far.
The Director of the Queenland Legal Centre, James Farels, said that the latest report of the Association of National Legal Centres reports that legal aid is now being denied to thousands of people who need it.
Mr. Farels pointed out that if this decision was not to be repealed, the situation would only become worse.
He also says: "The Queenland legal centre is constantly receiving insufficient funding, which means that the aid is denied to thousands of people who need it."
People who seek to end violent relations, people with deep debts, families with divorce, workers who are unjustly dismissed - all of these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not receive the help they need.
With effect from June 2017, the federal government will reduce funding by 30 per cent, meaning that more than a thousand people in Queensland will have to deal with their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney General and the Senator George Brandis of Queenland to stop the reduction of funding immediately so that people who need legal assistance can get it.
Last year, the government revealed its plans to build a level of legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to focus also on the needs of local communities and their clients and the Palestinian Government to invest in this important area.
Donald Tramp campaign in court because one of the employees was fired by a gunman
New York: The organizers of the Donald Tramp campaign were sued in court because they had not acted on the information that its North Carolina Operation Manager had turned the shooter against an employee when they drove in one car in February.
This incident was described in a court request submitted to the Court on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini, the former campaign programmer.
Bordini said he had waited months for an internal review of this case to begin, but realized it would not.
Head Erles Philips "drawed a gun, placed his good indicator finger on the floor and turned his back on Vincent's road", Bordini claimed in his complaint.
He also claimed that by submitting complaints to local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four more people had experienced the same.
"The weapons do not have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini writes in her complaint.
Only two days before the case was filed, the candidate of the Republican Party to the presidency caused a scandal, informing people that the owners of the Second Amendment people, i.e. the owners of the weapons and the enthusiasts, could take action if the election would win his chance by Hilaria Clinton and his elected judges.
The representatives of the trampo campaign announced that the media had taken his words out of context, and he never gave up on violence.
Bordini wants to get compensation from campaign organizers for slow monitoring, but from the Philippines for assault, illegal use of weapons and emotional stress.
The trampa representative, Hope Hicks, did not comment immediately.
He hasn't been able to contact Philip.
WCCB - Charlotte's local news agency reports that Philip recently left the campaign.
Nor has he managed to call his consulting company "Innovative Consultancy Services".
The candidate Donald Trumps, president of the Republican Party, has carried out a controversial election campaign.

New tradition - the holiday of the countryside and sport in the village.
On Saturday, for the first time, people gathered for the holidays of the countryside and sports.
This time, after ten years of celebration, it was decided that the festivals of Ezra would no longer be held.
The new page has now been changed.
The day began with sports competitions.
At this time, the competition was not traditional and too serious to take, because for example, the shots had to be put to the sleeping goal, the frog flew, with a man's left handle, "bombing" was not at all in any Olympic games.
However, each participant was able to show how strong, courageous, courageous and resourceful he was.
After the sports games, all gathered in the leisure work, where the holidays began.
At that time, the "child drive" also worked, where the little ones could get out in the exciting attractions and get a new picture in the closet.
A new thing that could also become a tradition was a vehicle debt, with both tractors and motorcycles.
Everyone spoke of the Inga Kadiķe-Skadinja, the head of the administrative district of Oulzcima, who wanted a pleasant rest and a dry time, but the rains fell, but it was not able to disturb much.
Celebrations continued with the greeting of the youngest inhabitants of the village of Oulcema.
Indeed, it is good that the parishioner has joined five girls and one boy.
The performances of the performers had been brought by amateur artists from the Engures municipality - the viewers were very pleased with the performances of the old dance set "Rudens", the performances of the various folk dance performers "Reds" and the young dancers "Zelta Pearls".
And there's nothing that might have happened on the hide-and-seek scene for a while.
Of course, local people and neighbors were delighted to receive the famous actors' duet, Jānis Jaráns and Dainis Porgants, who were again Mildinis Nabins and Šaidrīte Kraninis, as well as the attractive women of Bērzciem from the fishing village "Dienņa".
Balli played the "Brugs" group.
Britain needs to maintain the Olympic spirit and expand the Heathrow.
Hitrova will not only promote prosperity and growth in local regions and in London, but also throughout the country.
This, I think, makes Hitrov very attractive, just as in 2012 in London, where we have invested enormously in order for all the national regions to benefit from the Olympic Games.
Stratford and Istanda have won tremendously much of the Olympics.
And we will do this again by providing locals and businesses with business opportunities close to Hitrov.
To the local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new business opportunities, 40,000 new jobs and finally add a point to youth unemployment in the Hitrov area.
As in the 2012 London Olympics, there will be people this time who will think that this challenge is too big and that the expansion of Hitrov is too ambitious.
At that time, people said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympics and that it would be a global waste.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012 and in the case of Hitrov, they will not be right.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Hitrov has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympic Games, Hütrova is an infrastructure project that benefits the entire society, not individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating both employment and experience at this airport and throughout the UK.
In Hütrov, an excellent team that has created an investment programme of 11 billion worth of infrastructure, including in time and in the budget starting with a terminal 5, which has been named the best airport in the world for five years and finally with a terminal 2, which is built between two more intensively used routes in the world.
Now they are ready to set up a third route, which will be financed by private investment of 16 billion pounds.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success, and I am confident that this will also be the expansion of Hitrov.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand the Hitrov by ensuring our future trade and creating a new employment environment with which Britain might be proud.
Lord Paul Deiton is a member of the Board of Hütrov and former Secretary of Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
In Switzerland, a woman rises to the street trying to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, he falls on the road.
The police are trying to find witnesses in an accident when she was moved across several cars early on Thursday morning.
The incident took place on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the town of Morges in Vo canton.
The Vo Canton police report said that she was desperate to commit suicide, and she had fallen asleep on the road in the dark, where she was taken by several cars.
The victims, 49 - year - old Swiss, obviously tried to kill themselves, drove several machines, including a heavy machine.
She's dying at the scene.
Several involved drivers have already given evidence, but others involved have not yet been identified, says the police, calling on the drivers involved and the witnesses of the accident.
The case has also launched a criminal investigation, which in this case is a logical step, according to the lawyer Gilles Hofstellers, who told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was It Possible to Avoid Controversy?
The prosecutor adds: "It will be found by the prosecutor."
Two similar cases, which have occurred in the last five years, indicate that none of the drivers will be held responsible.
In both cases, the walker had gone to the high street in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not expect the walker to be in the middle of the night, the mail newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was righted to be killed because of neglect when in August 2014, she was taken by a man who slept in the middle of the night on the A1 road near Paijerne.
The court found that at the age of 22, the victim was drunk and later noticed that he was lying on the road.
The court concluded that a police officer who was on his way to an accident was on his way in an appropriate manner and the judge recognized that the sleeping man on his way was "a completely unexpected and extraordinary case".
Anyone who has information about the incident on Thursday near Morges has been invited to contact the police by telephone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
On the Internet, signatures are collected for the appointment of a new VID leader.
The opening of signatures at Avaaz.org petition portal for the appointment of a new Head of State Revenue Service (VID).
The petition addressed to the Ministers of the National Associations (NA) and the Green and Agricultural Union (ZZS) states that the public wants a transparent and professional appointment process.
The petition was created on 10 a.m. and is currently signed by 55 people.
The proceedings for the appointment of the Director-General of the VID ingas Kolīgova are transparent and non-professional.
It shall recall the traditions of the Union’s best officials.
This discredits public administration and makes the public hope in government and politicians the next time.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria against which all candidates must be evaluated," the text of the petition said.
Its author, Jānis B., pointed out that the public did not know the criteria as Kolügova chose for his office.
Nor is it clear what is the candidate's intention to do the VID.
The request states that a new open invitation to tender is to be made by the State Chancellor, which is actively addressed by professional candidates, staffing specialists involved and offered an appropriate remuneration.
The Minister of Finance Dana Reiznieces-Ozola officially appointed the head of the Kolügov VID last week, and this week the government intended to approve him in his new position, but all the ministers of the "Unity" party voted against, so the question for the week was postponed.
Samilov: If we lost, I played bad.
Pludmale volleyballists Aleksandrs Samoilovs and Jānis Šmēdīņš were hoping for the prize in the Olympic Games of Riodeganeiro, but without it, there was no difference where the competition ended, Samoilovs said after leaving the tournament.
One of the world's most powerful pairs of beach volleyballs in the final and decisive tournament of the four-day tournament with 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost the Brazilians to Evandra Gonsalveš Oliver and Pedro Solberg Salgad, concluding their participation in the four-quarters most important sports forum.
In the three sub-group matches, Latvian athletes won one win, but the same relationship was two more pairs.
The relationship between three pairs of small points was listed below, which was the most unfavourable of Latvia's duet after the strong loss in the match.
"In the first set we were in charge, but from 16:15 so we also stayed at 16 points", the game was remembered by Šmēdiš.
I don't even know how the rest of the set was left without points.
It must not be played.
Then in the second set, everything was fine and the set finally succeeded in breaking the game, and it should also be a good foundation for the third set.
We started it in a similar way, but after we got together with the parties, the result grew only for one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the subgroup, all teams were similar, almost all of them had three sets, so small points were important.
"I should have played a more similar game than I would have given up 3-4 points in a row," said the sportsman.
We knew that the Gospel could be preserved.
"In the first set we met with it at the end, in the second we inserted 1-2 points, but in the third at +4 he already left the game," recalls Šmēdiš.
We tried to show the best game.
It's just a few minutes ago, not a few minutes.
I did not see the co-evaluation situation before the match, but it was known that there were as few points as possible.
"If we lost, then I played bad," Samoilov said.
We waited for a good servant from the Gospel, and in the first sessions we met quite well, but in the third, the servant opened up and found it difficult to make an attack.
On my own, I made many mistakes at Pedro’s service, but it had to be done.
Samilov told us that unlike the previous match today, sportsmen were not nervous.
"We went, we played, there was protection, but we needed better service," said the sportsman.
"They played well and in the end they've already gathered to "Urra."
Before the tournament, we immediately said that the explosion was as uncomfortable as it could have been.
We also had the opportunity to fight for the first place, but we didn't even go out of the group.
"All of us expected a medal and we also expected it from ourselves, but then there are no more differences - 25th place or fourth," said Samilovs, who predicted that the duet will continue to play together also in the future.
I don't think there's going to be a question and we're going to keep playing together, because this is just one tournament.
Samilova Riodezaneiro was already the third Olympics in his career, as in 2008 in Beijing he started with Martin Plavin, but four years ago in London he played with Ruslan Sorokin.
In the meantime, this was the second start in the Olympics.
"Latvenergo" follows the process of opening the gas market also from the potential dealer position.
The state energy company Latvenergo follows the process of opening the gas market both from the consumer and from the potential trader's position, said the company's press secretary Ivita Bidere.
"The decision on whether to join the Latvenergo gas market in the future as a trader will determine which gas market model and legal framework will be set up."
"That is why we are actively involved in the drafting and commenting of legislation and in submitting our proposals," Bidree said.
BNS has already written that the Ministry of Economic Affairs (EM), in cooperation with the Public Services Regulatory Commission and the energy company "Latvijas Gáze" has developed draft rules of the Ministry of Natural Gas Trade and Use, which will change the operating principles of the natural gas market since 3 April 2017 by ensuring that natural gas users have the right to choose the natural gas trader freely.
The aim of EM is to make the natural gas trade process as simple as possible and as easy as possible for the user.
Therefore, the most efficient and user-friendly service solution is chosen as a "trader's central model", in which all activities relating to customer service are provided by a trader - one contract, one bill and one information and customer service location, leaving the technical issues of the natural gas distribution system to the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is now being implemented in electricity trade.
We recall that the gradual opening of the market for domestic users - also after 3 April 2017, those domestic users who would not choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming related users.
"In such a case, the obligation to supply natural gas to users at a regulated price is fixed for the public trader," the Ministry informed.
On the other hand, traders will have to choose a natural gas trader to conclude a natural gas trade agreement.
By the end of a certain period of time for the conclusion of the natural gas trade agreement, traders will be provided with natural gas trade at a fixed price.
The draft rules of the Cabinet of Ministers detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
The rules shall lay down the arrangements for the supply of natural gas to users and suspend its supply, the requirements for the safe use of the natural gas system, the trader, the public trader, the system operator, the user and the gasified object owner in the supply and use of natural gas; the arrangements for the provision of payments for services received, the percentage of delays, the arrangements for changing the supply of natural gas to consumers; the arrangements for the provision of natural gas to connected users by the public trader.

Minister: The next week is scheduled to discuss an increase in the remuneration of the Director-General of the VID.
Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Green and Agriculture Union (ZZS)) plans to talk to the government coalition partners next week about the increase in the remuneration of the Director-General of the State Revenue Service (VID).
Reizniece-Ozola told reporters on Friday that the issue of increasing the remuneration of the Director-General of the VID had to be addressed urgently in order to make this position more attractive to potential re-applicants.
It was also discussed next week about changing the terms of the invitation to tender.
The Minister also stressed that she did not consider any particular candidate to be invited to the vacancy.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola expressed the view that Inga Kolügova, the head of the State Environment Service, would have been a good director of the VID.
On the other hand, with regard to the current executive of the VID leader Daci Pelēko, who has expressed his readiness to apply for this post, the Minister reiterated the view that the new Director-General of the VID should be "on the side" and should not come from the VID structure.

It has also been reported that the former Director-General of VID Inara Peterson resigned at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to rise; exchange indexes in the US and Europe, as well as US dollar value increase.
Oil prices in the world continue to increase in the morning of Friday morning, with the positive impact of investor attitudes on the statements of the Saudi Minister of Oil Affairs, which reinforces the expectation that the largest oil beneficiary countries will be taking steps to stabilise the world oil market at the OPEC meeting to be held in September.
The three main U.S. stock exchange indices reached record levels on Thursday, which have not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in oil prices and the strong financial indicators of several large companies.
The rise in the oil price and the strong financial indicators of several companies also led to a rise in European stock exchange indexes on Thursday.
The US dollar value increased on Thursday against the euro, against the UK market and against Japan.
The price of WTI's raw oil at the New York Stock Exchange in electronic commerce increased by $1.78 to $43.49 per barrel on Thursday in September.

The turnover of the preserved producer "Zilā laguna" per year decreases by 33.8%.
The turnover of the preserve producer "Zila laguna" was EUR 4,202 million last year, which is 33.8% less than a year ago, while the company's losses decreased 5.7 times - to EUR 904.7 thousand, according to the annual financial report published in the Lursoft database.
In 2015, the company’s management report stated that the company had suffered losses due to several reasons, including the lack of permanent turnover caused by the withdrawal of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market by the end of the previous credit line and leaving the Green Lagoon with contracts without the possibility to execute them.
Consequently, the company did not have sufficient funds to purchase cheaper raw materials in large volumes and to receive a discount.
The withdrawal of the bank concerned from the Latvian market also enabled the company to implement projects of support from the European Union Structural Funds that would allow the factory to acquire new production equipment and modernise the infrastructure.
Similarly, the financial creators of the company during the year of the transfer had a negative impact on the increase in the price of raw materials and the unwillingness of customers to pay more than the goods produced by the company.
"Only on the other hand in July 2016 did customers recognise price changes and were ready to buy goods for the new - higher - prices," company management points out.
In 2015, the Blue Ladder also began to negotiate with potential investors, including the assessment of the company's mobile and mobile assets.
Investors have already been with the company's largest creditor "Unicredit Leasing", where the parties have recognized and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company's activities and development had a positive impact on the implementation of the restructuring and optimization plan launched in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimization of technological processes, which enables greater productivity and capacity to be achieved.
"Several equipment was purchased to ensure greater production speed," the company's management indicated.
The management of the Blue Ladder notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company's production to comply with orders that have not yet been possible.
The first batch of production to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
As the sales of the product have already been signed, all the products produced will be sold in accordance with the sales of the intended products.
The new product will increase turnover by about 300 thousand euros a month," the company's management points out.
The company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement on supplies of fish production to Iraq in August 2016.
In 2016, he sent the first experimental container to Israel, expanded the market of the deieta to Cyprus, and this September will sign a cooperation agreement with a new wholesale chain in the USA.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase turnover.
In 2014, "The Blue Ladder" worked with a turnover of EUR 6,347 million and EUR 5,113 million for losses.
"The Blue Desert" was established in 1997 and its core capital is EUR 1,156 million.
The company belongs to two Latvian private persons - Mikhail Kaidanova (89.1%) and Igor Širshon (10.89%).
Welcome to pl. 15 at the museum to wait for Zāra Leanderi film live and attend the press conference.
Riga can be seen as a city of the beginning and inspiration of the career of the godless film Zāras Leanderes.
The residence of Zāras Lendere at the crusader Ruth, who was a Swedish ambassador to Latvia, was fatal in 1924, because she just discovered the unusual low contract for Zāras Lendere's wife, who tried to go to the theater theater in Riga.
Perhaps just the random question in Riga became a fatal turning point in Zara’s creative way against the world’s glory.
Riga Zárrai Leanderi was bound by warm memories, and she was hoping to visit Riga’s guests, but unfortunately these hopes were not fulfilled because the Second World War began.
Using the presentation form, this meeting will be possible in Riga in 2016 and the excellent role of Záras Leanderes will be played by the excellent Ieva Kerēvica.

There was a sexual assault on two children at the amusement park in England.
The Berkshire Police are looking for an intruder who has sexually used two-year-old girls in the Legoland amusement park, a message from Daily Mail.
The police asked the parents to study the photos taken in the entertainment park, as they could see the attacker.

The Kurdish activists shall enter the German public radio organisation building.
A group of 30 large Kurds attended the WDR public radio station in Diseldorf on Thursday evening, where they held a protest campaign of almost two hours, reports the German police.
The demonstrators, who came with the posters taken, searched for different calls, trying to draw attention to the current situation in Turkey.
Officials report that the demonstration has taken place peacefully and the protestors have, at the end of the workers' request, voluntarily left.
The insurer shall pay compensation for passengers on Wednesday at the airport.
If Insurance paid a travel insurance fee to a family on Wednesday, on 10 August at Riga Airport, which resulted in a cancellation of the scheduled music festival visit.
On 11 August, If Insurance received an application for compensation from a client.
The family had planned to go to a music festival in Belgium, but since it was not possible due to the aerials cancelled on Wednesday at the airport, the customer was charged with the booking of accommodation that could no longer be cancelled, as well as the tickets purchased at the festival amounting to EUR 204.
On the other hand, customers have promised to pay the airline the money spent on the plane tickets.
If Insurance for all travel insurance payments has paid on average 15% of the compensation for termination or cancellation of the travel.
"There are times when costs are paid for the purchase, delivery or exchange of tickets, as well as for the booking of the accommodation," says Dagni Rutka, Head of the Insurance Person Risks Product.
As it is known, on the evening of August 10th, a private plane stopped due to technical problems at Riga Airport, so only several departing flights were cancelled, but several incoming flights had to be sent to other airports.
Because of the cabin repair, the man is at the edge of the fence and the pressure is to leave the house.
In the LTV broadcast "4. studio" Dmitrijs Saidjašev, whose neighbor has begun to repair the capital in his apartment, and since then Dmitri has had a strict siege and is not sure that staying in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbors carried out voluntary construction and my apartment was damaged.
Then I informed the Riga Building Board, the Home Manager and other organisations.
The Construction Authority said that we are no operational service and that we have no expert.
"The owner of the apartment must go to the Latvian Engineering Union, and there will be an expert from there," Dmitrijs says.
The requested expert has arrived, has established the incident and has acknowledged that the overriding situation is unsatisfying.
However, since Dmitria’s first submission to the construction board, the month has passed, and by the beginning of this week, no one has been able to answer whether the apartment is in danger of life.
In the building, I said, there's legislation, wait, if you're not satisfied, write to everyone in order.
"Then I wrote to Riga's mind, but they sent it to the house manager, then the house manager went back to the building, and then there's a roadblock," says Dmitry.
After all the paperwork, it is clear that the construction works are stopped, although everyone can hear that someone is working there.
For another two months, the owner of the apartment, who does the repair work, must have all these defects removed.
The independent expert has drawn up his opinion, but the construction board considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal regime in this non-existent structure has been affected, and therefore there is no doubt that the owner of the lower apartment is in danger.
"That is why we have requested further clarification from this expert," says Ilze Žuka, a representative of the city of Riga.
Despite the ban on any repair work in the upper apartment, we always hear that the building will continue.
The penalty for voluntary construction without construction permit is EUR 70 to 700, but in this case the penalty may be much more severe.
While the expert's opinion is expected, the Board of Directors has decided that the two apartments must not operate - both in which the construction works and in which Dmitry lives are carried out.
"This has not been the case in the case of the owner of the building in this way, because of his ignorance or simply lack of will, it may have created a threat not only to his property, but also to the owner of the lower property, as a result of which he cannot exploit his property," said the representative of the building manager.
Now Dmitri is left to find another place where to live - with relatives, friends, hotels, or rent another apartment.
But the damage caused by Dmitry can try to get away from the neighbor's civil order, which can take a lot of time.
Because of the voluntary construction, both apartments are now prohibited until the construction manager gives his conclusion, and it can be expected for up to three weeks.
The damage will have to be borne by the owner of the apartment where the repair work has been carried out.
The owner of this apartment, because the construction management has not taken into account, is also in danger of imprisonment for up to six months.
Come on!
How many praise in this picture?
The correct answer is five.
In Ukraine, five white lions were born in a zoo near Kiev.

The conversion of the former Chimeru sanatorium into a quay hotel will cost 22 million euros.
The conversion of the former Čemeri Sanatorium to the park hotel "Park Hotel Čemeri" will cost 22 million euros, a representative of Gita Želve, of the current hotel manager SIA "Park Hotel Čemeri" tells the agency.
The establishment of the hotel is the first phase of the restoration of the former Chimeru sanatorium.
The second stage will be "wellness" or a well-being clinic planned to be opened in 2022, while the opening of the hotel is scheduled in May 2018.
Zelve notes that the exact costs of the clinic are not yet known.
However, she points out that it will be located in the former Čemer resort polyclinic building, with an area of about 12,000 square feet [12,000 sq m].
The clinic will be located on three floors.
The Park Hotel Čemeri and the designated owner of the clinic are the international fund "G Capital Europe", which invests in European assets.
The owners of "G Capital Europe" are several investors who invest money in this fund, Želve points out.
As Executive Director George Jones of G Capital Europe said earlier, an investment of between EUR 12 million and EUR 15 million was planned to be made by the former court polyclinic, with a total investment of more than EUR 30 million.
It has already been announced that the restoration of the cultural park in more than 42 hectares of the area, the restoration of roads and streets, the construction of an interactive natural tourism facility, the repair of the territory and the construction of parking facilities on the Emelia Park, which will contribute to the socio-economic development of the city of Jurmala and the increase in the number of tourists, the Jourmala Council plans to attract €14.5 million from the European Union funds, co-financing with between €3 million and €4 million.
The design works planned by mid-2017, but the construction and sorting works will start in the autumn of the following year.
As reported, in the historic sanitary complex of Čemeri, it is planned to form a hotel for the adventure of the Park Hotel Čemeri and wellness, or a well-being clinic.
However, the reconstruction is delayed.
On the other hand, the 2010 report also stated that Ominasis was regularly communicating with the hotel operator "Kempinski", which continues to provide daily technical control in the "Kemeri" sanatorium", and that in 2011 it was established to meet the "complete reconstruction of the boiling hotels "Keminski"" and to start preparing for the opening of the "Keminski" chain hotel.
In October 2014, the Čemeri Park Hotel Čemeri confirmed its readiness to purchase the incapacitated "Ominass Latvia" Sanatorium Collection, but the month later the auction was recognised as not happening because the winner had not paid for the purchase at the time.
The selling price was determined at the starting price of the last outstanding auction – EUR 2.86 million.
As LETA informed the city council representative Ieva Aile, the municipality, in signing the protocol, has confirmed that, with the support of the co-financing of the European Union Structural Funds, the infrastructure that will be used in order to re-establish the historic chemer park will create an interactive nature tourism facility, roads and parking facilities.
The President will serve the Order of the Three Stars to operator Antonyenko.
The President of the State, Raymond Vyannis, will be serving the 3rd class of the Order of the Three Stars in the following week, according to the President's agenda.
The three Star Order ceremony will take place in the house of Melgalavju at 13.
As evidenced by the information provided by the Latvian National Opera and Ballet (LNOB), Antonyenko graduated from the Jazepa Mediņas Music College in 1998, where he learned the drumming instrument game and won the song at Margaritas Gruzdev.
He studied at the Vocal Department of the Latvian Academy of Music in Arvida Lustas class.
On the other hand, in 1997 he began singing the Latvian National Opera, but in 1998 he debuted with the role of Oberto in the G.F.Hedel opera "Alčina".
He received the "Great Music Award 2003" on vocal performances in opera shows and Verdi's record.
It is indicated that the 2004/2005 season has become the most internationally recognised Latvian tender, which is engaged by the world’s largest operateats.
Since the autumn of 2004, he sang "Diseldorf Deutsche Opera am Rhein", Berlin and Greece opera, Dräzdene "Semperoper", Oslo and Stockholm Kingdom opera, London Covent Garden opera, Montecarlo opera, Vienna State opera, as well as Geneva, Dräzdene and Diseldorf opera and Zalcburg Festival.
In 2009, Antonenko made a major debut in the Metropolitan Opera in the role of Prince "Nārā".
In 2011 Antonenko with Ricardo Muti and Chicago symphony orchestra sang the title "Otello" in Paris opera, he sang in the opera of Koventgárdena in a novelty by Louis "Ampmetnja" and also participated in the "Miteen in the West".
A year later, Antonyenko sang Otello’s role in the London Covent Garden.
The Russian hackers broke up by former NATO Commander Bridlov's e-mail.
Hackers who broke down the U.S. National Democratic Committee's (DNC) computers, possibly having committed several other cyber attacks, also broke down the former NATO European Force Commander Philip Brydlov's e-mail and the "Open Society" Institute of George Soros, the business news agency Bloomberg sent on Thursday.
Hackers have published information on DCLeaks.com.
Among other things, there is also a list and information on the work of the Soros Institute.
Computers at the Hacker Institute have been available for the whole year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyber attacks were carried out by the same hackers associated with Russian shipping, who broke down DNC emails.
The Wall Street Journal, in turn, reports that the U.S. President Barack Obama's administration is currently examining the issue of the imposition of new sanctions on Russia, thus responding to the collapse of DNC computers.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration will be officially charged with hackers supported by Russia or the Russian authorities on cyberattacks.
As reported, the WikiLeaks website published about 20,000 e-mails in July, which were obtained from the DNC computer system, and of which it is clear that the leaders of the Democratic Party have tried to harm the party's candidates, Hilary Clinton, to the former Sanctial Senator of Vermont Sanders' campaign for the start of the presidential nomination of the Democrats.
As reported by US press sources, the Federal Investigation Office, which conducts investigations into the breaking up of democratic servers, as well as other US envoys, believes that Russia's relationship with cyber-attack is unquestionable.
Macartney: Yoko Ono's presence threatened "The Beatles".
Paul Macartney acknowledged that Yoko Ono's presence created a sense of the threat of the legendary group "The Beatles".
The 74-year-old rock star currently maintains a "good" relationship with John Lenon's absenteeism, but at the time she went to visit the group in her study, she feared Makartnius because Ono was the only female member of the group - George Harrison, Ringo Star, Lenon and Makartnija - between.
When the singer asked about the two relationships, he said to the Rolling Stone magazine, "These are really good."
At that time, we felt threatened.
As we entered, she sat on the amplifiers.
Most of the groups could not endure it.
We have been able to do this, but not quite successfully, because we have been very busy.
We weren't sexists, but girls usually didn't come to a record study, and they let us work.
When John started to meet Yoko, she didn't sit in the control room, but in the middle of us.
The author of Yellow Submarine also admitted that he now regularly contacted the former band member Ringo, and every time the record study "Apple" work plans were approved, but the like "The Beatles" is "finished to work".
Asked whether he was still meeting with the only other living member of the legendary handcuff, Makartniy told the Rolling Stone magazine: "Of course not."
We meet in social events and dances.
However, I did not go to the meetings, and I felt a little limited.
I left Apple during a severe divorce.
At my place at the meetings, I sent John Trueman and said, "Tell me what everyone says, because I can't stand sitting on that table."
It was too painful to see our pet die.
The company now works so that I'll just listen to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus once had a habitable planet
On the basis of NASA's latest climate models, Venus has once been a viable planet.
NASA Godard Space Research Institute scientists have developed a model to study the history of Venus using tools and algorithms that climate scientists also use.
The model was designed to determine whether on Venus, whose surface is hot, where there is no water and whose atmosphere consists almost only of carbon, when conditions similar to Earth have ever been.
Scientists have already mentioned earlier that the slow speed of Venus is explained by the thick atmosphere.
However, recent simulations show that Venus once had a plane, an atmosphere similar to the Earth, and it would be slow.
The model also looks at the oldest topography of Venus.
There was more dry area on the planet than on Earth, but there was plenty of water and geographical diversity on it so that life could be created and water could not be drained.
In the early days of Venus, the sun was more than 30 percent shorter.
In the simulation of the GISS model, the Venus rotation model reveals that the light part of the day on it lasts for 2 months, explained in the press release by GISS scientist Antonio Del Genio.
This process warms the surface of the planet and causes a thing that, in turn, forms thick clouds that act as a rain guard to protect the planet from the heat of the sun.
The result is a moderate climate temperature, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model depicts the history of Venus, which is similar to the theory of evolution that scientists have developed in their hypotheses.
Although it was once inhabited, Venus was subjected to excessive heat and ultraviolet rays over billions of years.
Its oceans burned down, and the tides burned out ultraviolet stars.
When the water was completely drained, only the atmosphere of flat carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse gas - Venus, which we know today.
Scientists published the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roys departs from the work of Coach Avalanche
On Thursday, Colorado's Avalanche coach and hockey operations Vice-President Patrick Roys submitted a request, as a reason to mention, insufficient impact on the team's decision-making process.
The Colorado Vice-President and General Jo Sakiks confirmed this news and informed that the club was about to start looking for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I've been energetic, exciting and targeted as the chief coach and vice-president of the Colorado Club hockey operations," Rojs, 50 years old, writes in his statement.
During this summer, I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve the performance of the team in order to give it the required height and achieve the results of the higher level.
In order to achieve this, the visions of the vice-president of the main coach and hockey operations must be fully in line with the visions of the organisation.
It should also be able to influence decisions relating to the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakik, who was appointed on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
He said Patrick informed her about his decision today.
We appreciate all that he has done for the organization and want it to be better for him further.
In his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014, Roys was recognised as the best coach in the league and received Jack Adams' prize.
He helped the club reach 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of exclusion games, the Colorado team won the Minesota hockey player. Since then, the club has not been involved in exclusion games for two years.
Avalanche concluded the 2015-2016 season with a result 39-39-4 and left five points behind the Wild team without obtaining the second special invitation from the Western Conference organisers.
The guard of the glory of the cure Roys, in his career, fought four Stanley cases - two with Montreal's "Canadian" and two with "Avalanche".
North Sea oil platform workers resume negotiations and leave the strike
Workers' strikes on North Sea oil platforms have been suspended because the negotiations between the parties to the dispute have been resumed by the heads of the e-mail negotiations.
On a periodic basis, strikes against the oil processing company "Wood Group" are held on the North Sea oil platforms where the company "Royal Dutch Shell" operates.
The Joint Communication states that Wood Group and Unit and RMT trade unions have agreed to resume negotiations on resolving the dispute.
Several full days of meetings are scheduled for next week to begin with the aim of re-examine the problematic issues.
The trade unions reported that their recent measures, organised after more than 25 years of interruption, were aimed at 30% of the planned reduction in wages.
This year, due to the negative market pressure, Wood Group reduced wages for North Sea workers by 9%.
Already in 2014, the company reduced the wages of land workers by 10 per cent.
The company explains that additional wage reductions would allow the company to survive market declines.
On the other hand, Shell has already reduced the wages of several thousand people and announced plans to stop oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries to optimize its work in preparation for a large-scale merger with the British energy company "BG Group".
Energy companies feel pressured by oil prices, and the situation is increasingly difficult for Britain to abandon the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, Mr Deives Anderson, Member of the Scottish Parliament, met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - North Sea strike plans.
He said the North Sea is vital to the region's economy.
In his report he explains that the North Sea and the state in general need an economy from which everyone, not individuals, would benefit.
In 2016, the new North Sea projects are expected to invest almost $1.4 billion compared to the $7 billion invested over the last five years.
Kepler measures the speed of star rotation in the Pleiades star.
The latest mission of the Kepler telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue on the speed of the star rotation in the Pleiades star.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars in this star are spinning at different speeds and how the star rotation rate is related to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will obtain more information about the relationship between the mass, age and even the history of the solar system," said Professor Luis Rebula of Pasadenas Caltech Infrared Process and Analytical Centre.
The flash star is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many stars in this star only begin to grow to about 125 million years old.
They shall be rotated at the maximum speed.
At maximum speed, these rising stars emit a large amount of star wind.
When the winds arrive in the magnetic field, they brake the stars.
As the stars get older, their speed decreases.
Kepler measures the speed of each star rotation by determining the time between a known star area, such as the solar plane.
The latest catalogue of star rotations shows that larger stars are turning slower than smaller stars.
Rebuls compare stars to dancers, larger growth propellers perform pyrites less slowly than small growth propellers.
Rebul is said to show that slow rotating objects are larger and larger, while faster rotating objects are very small stars.
Thanks to the closeness of the Pleiades star, it serves as a great space laboratory, where it can compare the characteristics of the stars with the speeds of rotation.
Rebul says that the Pleiades star helps to create theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both parent and younger stars.
We still need to learn a lot about how, when and why the speed of star rotation slows down and about their complete stopping process.
Rebul and his colleagues presented in detail the analysis of the speed of the Pleiades star rotation in three new publications, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
