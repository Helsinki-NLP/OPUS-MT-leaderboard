People had a lot of glass in their seats, but the windows didn't get cold.
One of the glass finally burst and they started to slide through the window," said the surviving Franciszek Kowal.
The stars emit light and heat because by connecting (slowing) hydrogen atoms to form heavier elements, energy is created.
Scientists aim to create reactors that can produce energy in the same way.
However, this is a very difficult problem to solve, and we will see the useful synthesis reactors built only after many years.
The flammable needle on the surface of the water is drained due to surface tension.
The surface tension occurs because the water molecules on the surface of the water draw much stronger than the air molecules on the surface of the water.
The water molecule on the surface of the water consists of an invisible film that allows the needle to float on the surface of the water.
Modern self-esteem axles have two screws, between which there is an intruder. Two screws allow better fit into the ice even on the back.
Since the bottom of the blades is slightly stretched, the blade that is affected by the ice also bends to the side of the blade.
This allows the smoker to make a move. If the self-adhesive is directed to the right, the smoker turns to the right, and if the self-adhesive is directed to the left, the smoker turns to the left.
To return to the previous level of energy, they must remove the additional energy they have received from light.
They do this by reflecting a small piece of light called a photon.
Scientists call this process "pristine in light radiation", because bright light stimulates atoms, therefore light photons are reflected and light is a type of radiation.
The next picture shows photon radiation atoms. Of course, photons are much smaller in reality than in the picture.
The photons are smaller than the particles that make up atoms!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the extinguishing lamp is finally incinerated and the lamp is no longer working.
The lamp must then be changed. The lamp must be changed carefully.
You must first turn off the lamp switch or turn off the wire.

The blood comes from the heart with blood vessels called arteries, and the blood vessels are returned to the heart with veins called veins. The smallest blood vessels are called capillaries.
Trieratops’ teeth could not only cut the leaves, but also the very hard roots and roots.
According to some scientists, the triratops ate ciquins, such as plants that were spread over the period of the fall.
These plants are similar to a small palm tree with sharp, large leaves.
Perhaps Trieratops used his powerful serpent to kill all the leaves before eating the rock.
Other scientists claim that these plants are highly poisonous, and therefore it is unlikely that any dinosaurs eat them, while today’s insects and other animals, such as frogs (dinosaurs’ offspring), can eat poisonous leaves or fruit.
If you would stand on the surface of it, you would weigh less than the earth.
A person weighing 200 weights (90 kg) on earth weighs about 36 weights (16 kg) so gravity, of course, is less likely to attract you.
The sun has no flesh on which to stand, like the earth on it. The whole sun is made of gas, fire, and plasma.
The gases become more intense as they move from the center of the sun.
The visible outer part of the sun is called a photosphere, meaning “lightballs”.
After some three thousand years in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo noticed that Venus has phases like the Moon.
The phases exist because only one side of Venus (or Moon) is lit up – the one that turned to the sun. The Venus phase supported Copernicus' theory that the planets revolve around the sun.
A few years later, in 1639, English astronomer Jeremiah Horrocks observed the phenomenon of Venus transit.

There are many theories of the origin of Sanskrit. According to one of their arias, migration from the west to India, brought their language.
The Sanskrit is an ancient language similar to that of Latin used in Europe.
The oldest book in the world, of course, was written in the Sanskrit language.
The convention is a very complex and rich language, which has become a source of many modern Indian languages (as well as Latin, which is a source of European languages such as French and Spanish).
After the French invasion, Germany began preparing for an invasion into the British island.
Germany called the operation a code name "Sea lions". Most of the heavy weapons and stocks of the British army were lost evacuating from Dunkirk, so the army was quite weak.
But the Royal Navy was still much more powerful than the German fleet ("Warsmarine") and could destroy any invasion fleet sent to pass Lamanša.
However, very few of the Royal Navy ships were based on unlikely invasion routes, for the Admirals feared that they would be destroyed during the German air raid.
First, let us explain the Italian plans. Italy was mainly the "small brother" of Germany and Japan.
Their army and their fleet were weaker than they, even though they had built four new ships before the war began.
The main aims of Italy were the African countries. To occupy these countries, it needed military departure sites to allow them to cross the Mediterranean and enter Africa.
To this end, they had to remove British bases and ships in Egypt. Besides these actions, there was no need for Italian military vessels to do anything else.
Now about Japan, Japan, like Britain, was an island state.
Subsidiary vessels shall be such vessels as are intended to sail under water for a longer period of time.
The submarines were used in World War I and World War II. They were then very slow and had a limited range of shooting.
At the start of the war, they mainly sailed on the surface of the water, but when they improved and began to operate more accurately for radar, the submarines were forced to move so as not to be noticed.
German submarines were called U Boat. German submarines navigated well and managed.
Since the Germans have successfully used submarines, they are not allowed to have many of them after the war.
Yes, King Tutanchamon, sometimes called King Tutu or King of the boy, is one of the most well - known modern times in ancient Egypt.
It is observed that in ancient times he was not considered to be very important, and he was not included in most of the lists of ancient kings.
However, after his tomb was discovered in 1922, it became a hallmark. Many of the ancient tombs were to be buried, and this tomb was actually unpaved.
Many Tutanchamon-backed objects, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare stones, were well maintained.
Assyrian carriages became easier, faster and better prepared to cover the wares and other carriages.
Some 1,000 years before Christ, the Assyrians had already had the first known artillery.

We know a lot of Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Perhaps the most famous personality of this culture is the legendary blind poet Homer, created by two Greek literary masterpieces: poem Iliada and Odyssey.
Sofoklis and Aristotle are still popular playwrights, and their tracks are among the best works of literature in the world.
Another sound Greek is the mathematical Pythagorean, best known for its famous theorem, which describes the relationship between fixed triangles.
The numbers of people speaking Hindi differ. It is believed to be between the second and the fourth most commonly used languages in the world.
The number of speakers in the native language depends on whether the phrases are included very closely.
It is estimated that there are about 340 to 500 million users and 800 million people can understand that language.
The words of Hindi and Urdu are similar, but different in writing; users of both languages can usually communicate with each other on a daily basis.
In about the 15th century, the culture of Northern Estonia was influenced by Germany.
Some Germans, however, wanted to draw close to the local people, so they developed the vernacular language of the East.

In order to learn how to create interactive media, it is necessary to develop standard, traditional skills and tools, acquired and managed through interactive lessons (chain, audio and video editing, speech development, etc.).
Taking an interactive design you will have to reassess your assumptions about media production and learn non-linear thinking.
The interactive design needs to connect the components of the project with each other, but also have meaning as individual entities.
The lack of objectivity in changing the image is that the number of cross-complexity and lens elements needed to reach the distance of the cross-section requires a lot more basic lenses.
This problem decreases as the producers of poultry achieve higher standards for the production of poultry.
This allowed the use of an approximate lens to take photos of the quality of which is equivalent to the quality, obtained by using a fixed focus distance lens.
Another lack of an optical enhancement function is that the maximum aperture (speed) of this object is usually lower.
It is therefore difficult to use non-synthetic targets without light under poor lighting conditions.
One of the most common problems in trying to convert a movie into a DVD format is that the image extends beyond the screen display limits.
Many televisions are produced to meet the needs of the general public.
For this reason, everything you see on TV was surrounded from the top, the bottom, and the sides.
This is used to take a picture of the entire screen. It is called a picture extending beyond the screen display (overscan).
Unfortunately, when creating a DVD, its edges will probably also be crushed, and if the subtitles of the video were too close to the bottom, they will not be fully displayed.
The traditional middle-aged elephant has long mastered the imagination of people – a lot of people remember the riders ’ struggles, the rise of movements, and the traditions of the knighting of the King Arthur’s time.

A possible balance was a system that was used by European nations to maintain national sovereignty in all European countries.
The idea was that all European nations should have tried to prevent one of them from becoming powerful, so the national authorities often replaced the allies in order to maintain balance.
The Spanish occupation war was the first war with the main object of the dispute being a power balance.
This has led to a significant change because the powerful Europeans have lost the title of religious wars, which is why the Thirty Years' War is the last war called the religious war.
The Festival of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed in 356 B.C.E. at the inauguration of Herostrata.

MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States that currently has 54 million profiles.
These sites have received much attention, especially in the area of education.
These websites have positive aspects, such as easy identification of a class page, which may include websites, videos, photos and other features.
This page can be easily accessed by providing only one website address to easily remember and introduce students who may find it difficult to use a keyboard or write.
It can be adapted to be easy to read, as well as to add as many or as few colors as desired.
A lack of attention is “a neurological syndrome defined by three classic symptoms: impulse, exposure and hyperactivity or excess energy”.
This is not a development disorder, it is a learning disorder, which affects between 3 and 5% of all children, perhaps even 2 million American children.
For children with defined activity and attention disorder, it is difficult to focus on things such as learning, but they can concentrate on doing what they like, for example, playing games, watching favorite cartoons or writing phrases without distinction marks.
These children can cause a lot of problems, because they are "risked, tortured and opposed to officials", in order to stimulate their brains because it is not possible to do so in the ordinary way.
The problem is that other children do not understand why they are doing so, why they write, or do not understand that they are at a different level.
In the above-mentioned way, changing the ability to acquire knowledge and learning changes the basic rate of acquisition of knowledge.
The information was received in a different way.It was no longer forced to remember separately, but more attention was focused on the ability to remember the text.
Renaissance has significantly changed the view of learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, Hominides no longer use their hands to move, maintain weight, or burn under trees.
The width and the foot of the chimpanzee are similar in size and length, and this shows that the width reflects the weight when walking on the curves.
The human limbs are shorter than the feet, the limbs are more accurate.
This splendour of the speculatory system reveals a 2-3 million-year-old broad bone fossilisation.
Some people believe that many and often artificial dreams can be very distressing.
The main reason for this event is the result of clear dreams that prolong the time between the rest of the sleep (REM) phases.
When the night is less of the REM phase, this state, when you actually sleep and the body recovers, becomes quite rare and this causes problems.
It is as if you would wake up every twenty or thirty minutes and watch TV.
The effect depends on how often the brain tries to dream consciously at night.

Each of these scars or scars continues for approximately 17 days.
What is the cell? The word cell came from a Latin word cell, which means "small room", and this term was first thought of by a man who examined the structure of the microscope.
The cell is the primary part of all living beings, and all organisms consist of one or more cells.
Cells are the basis of everything and are so important in life research that they are often referred to as life building blocks.
The nervous system supports homeostasis by sending nerve impulses throughout the body, ensuring continuous flow of blood.
These nerve impulses can be sent to the body very quickly, thus helping to protect the body from potential threats.
Compared with other severe storms, tornadoes cause damage in a small area, but they can destroy everything that happens on their way.
Tornadas drains trees, rips them off the floor, lifts them up into the sky cars. Two percent of the best tortoises remain for more than three hours.
The wind speed is 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).
People have been producing wings for thousands of years, and for the sake of enlargement, they have been using them for thousands of years.
However, the first real telescopes were created in Europe at the end of the 16th century.

The animals are made of many cells. They eat and digest food. Most animals are moving.
The brain has only animals (though not all animals, for example, do not have brains).
Animals can be found anywhere on earth. They live on the ground, swim in the water, and fly in the sky.
The cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of the living organism.
The word "cell" comes from the Latin "cella", which means a small room.
If you look alive after a microscope, you will see that they consist of small squares or balls.
Robert Hukas, an English biologist, saw small squares through the microscope in the pocket.
They looked like rooms, and he was the first to watch dead cells.
Chemical elements and compounds may move from one state to another without changing.
The properties of nitrogen gas are the same as liquid nitrogen. The density of the liquid structure is greater, but the molecules are the same.
Another example is water. Its compound consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
Its molecular structure remains unchanged, whether it is gas, liquid or solid.
Although its physical state may change, the chemical composition remains the same.
Time is around us and works all our activities, but it's hard to understand.
Thousands of years have been studied by researchers in religion, philosophy, and science.
It is time for us to experience the consequences of the events that are coming from the future through the present to the past.
The time can also be understood by comparing the duration (long) of events.
You can select for yourself the previous time by observing recurring cyclical events. cyclical events are all recurring events.
Photos and video recordings are being processed using computers today.
Useful animations can be created using computers and this type of animation is increasingly used on television and movies.

For a long time in the 19th and 20th centuries, it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were Maori, who hunted huge birds of mine.
The theory then emerged that the Maori came from Polynesia and took over from the moratoriums New Zealand by establishing an agricultural society.
However, the new data show that the killers were a group of mothers living on the ground, moving from New Zealand to Chatham Island and creating a peaceful culture.
There was another generation in the islands of Chatham, the Maori who migrated from New Zealand.
They were called moratoriums; several incidents occurred, and eventually the moratoriums were destroyed.
People who have been involved for decades have helped us to assess our advantages and enthusiasm by openly pointing to difficulties and even failures.
By listening to the stories of people, families and organisations involved, we received valuable insights into the past and some people who had a positive or negative influence on the culture of the organisation.
Understanding your history does not mean understanding culture yet, but at least it helps people to understand how they fit into the history of the organization.
In assessing the success and knowledge of failures, persons and all participating persons are more familiar with the values, mission and driving forces of the organisation.
In this case, the memory and success of previous examples of business behavior helped people to open up new developments and to give the local church a new direction.
The stories of such success have reduced the fear of change and encouraged a positive view of change in the future.
Convergence thinking models are methods of problem solving, which are sought through a combination of different ideas or areas.
In this case, focus is given to speed, logic, accuracy, fact-finding, re-use of existing methods and the collection of information.
The most important aspect of such thinking is only one correct answer. You can only guess about two answers: right or wrong.
Such thinking is related to certain scientific or standard procedures.
Such people have logical thinking, may recall trends, solve problems, and work with scientific tests.
People are the most advanced kind, best able to understand others.
This means that we can successfully predict what other people realize, what they intend to do, what I know, or what they want.
One of these abilities – the understanding of other people’s intentions – is very important. It allows to resolve the possible uncertainty of physical action.
For example, if you saw someone smashing a car window, you would probably notice that this man was trying to steal a foreign car.
It would be assessed differently if you left the car keys and tried to get into your car.
MRT is based on a physics phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) found in the 20th century by Felix Blochas (worked at Stanford University) and Edward Purcelis (worked at Harvard University).
Because of this resonance, the magnetic field and the radio wave cause atoms to release small radio signals.
In 1970, the doctor and scientist Raymond Damadien found the basis for magnetic resonance images to be used as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later, a patent was issued, which was the first patent in the world, issued in the field of RTD.
In 1977 Dr. Damadian finished constructing the first "complemented" magnetic resonance reader, known as "unaccomplished".

Postmodern attitudes toward education when free from absolutes. There is no one good way to learn.
In fact, there is not one good thing to learn. Training takes place in the atmosphere between the learner and the knowledge presented.
This idea demonstrates our current experience regarding television broadcasts about how to do things for themselves, and information and training based broadcasts.
As many of us start watching any television show that informs us of a process or experience that we will never study and will not adapt to that knowledge.
We'll never rebuild a car that we won't set up a fountain, we won't move to Peru to experience the old ruins, and we won't renew the neighbor's house.
