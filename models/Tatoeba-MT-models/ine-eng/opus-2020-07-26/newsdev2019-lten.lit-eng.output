Kelyje on Alsterio "Lambretta" Club
The Lambretta motor oleores were unchanged in the 7th decade of fashion culture.
A group of Italian motorists tried to preserve the spirit of those times.
70 years after the establishment of the first Alster Lambretta Club, about 100 motorists from the United Kingdom and Ireland gathered in Fermana district this weekend.
One of the first two members of the club Chris Wilson acquired the first Lambretta in 1966 for about £40.
‘I was only a vehicle, but I learned that I could use it in a different way.
It was such a sport.
I didn't get involved in fashion culture, and now I'm probably too old for it," he said.
"It was pretty cheap and pretty reliable, you could have bought it at the affordable price, and it's got to do something more than just get from point A to point B."
He participated in the TT Church of Art Island in a separate start-up race.
The first Alster's Lambretta club was created at the beginning of the 8th decade and redesigned 12 years ago.
"About 1971 the motorists and other modes of transport are becoming increasingly dominant, and the clubs were generally affected by unrest, so I thought, "It's the end," said Chris.
"At that time, some time, there was a renewed interest and it seemed to be growing more and more."
Philip Steele is the secretary of Alster's Lambretta Club, with 97 members currently in charge of the members.
‘All reasons differ.
Some members were influenced by fashion culture because almost everything started from it.
Others are racing enthusiasts or roaches – you will find all people here.
There are also those who are simply interested in vintages.
Many engines are modified, so two are not alike.
It is possible to keep the engine running at 35 or 40 miles per hour at a speed adapted to the narrow streets of Italy, but some members have improved this.
Some highly modified motors could reach a speed of up to 100 miles per hour."
During the weekend, some motorists had to be pushed into the mud.
And although the weather in Northern Ireland is not always as pleasant as the Lambretta family in Italy, this time the sun shines on motorists driving around Fermana.
Ruth Davidson asks them to shut up about Brexit.
Ruth Davidson asked his fellow conservators for a "silence period", so that the minister could agree on Brexito.
The head of the Scottish team said that within two years of the EU referendum, time had been spent on the debate.
She expressed her opinion on Boris Johnson's premier plan, which he called "unreasonable and completely absurd".
She told the BBC Sunday Politics Scotland that it was time to support the Prime Minister.
At the party’s conference in Burma, she said: “In the past two years, we have had time for debate.
The former Secretary of Foreign Affairs was in office in one of the best cabinets' history and a major part of the current plan was prepared during that period, which had already been recognised last November.
The Conservatives now have to support the Prime Minister, allow her to complete the transaction and help implement the plans in the country.
I think the period of silence would be very useful."
Their comments followed a sharp criticism in Brexito's debate, which was not the first time the former Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson.
In an interview with BBC journalist Andrew Marro, Theresa May later confirmed that she believed in Brexit and that her cabinet plan could ensure a favourable trade deal with the European Union.
Mr Davidson also said that he would promise to prevent Scotland's second referendum on independence in other elections, because in 2014 "the shots were promised that such an event would be the only one in their generation".
Asked about a possible re-referendum on Brexito, she said: "If we are talking about Scotland's history, I have repeatedly stated that a referendum cannot be repeated if you are a nationalist and the result is not satisfactory.
I would rather, if I were to say that there could be another referendum on Brexito, because I expected a different result."

Christine'a Blasey Ford confirmed a statement on sexual harassment suspected of Bretta Kavanaugh
Lelanda Keyser, who was in high school friends with Dr. Christine'a Blasey Ford, accused the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh's sexual violence, when both of them were teenagers, wrote a letter to the Senate Court Committee and explained that he did not even remember the evening in the house through which an attack might have occurred, but believed in Ford's story.
Previously, Keyser, through his lawyer, made a statement that he did not remember that evening and did not even know if he had agreed to Kavanaugh.
On Thursday, testifying against the Court Committee, Kavanaugh’s statement often referred to Keyser as proof of his innocence, but did not mention Keyser’s claim that he believed in Ford’s words.
On Friday, the President briefed the FTB to conduct the investigation during the week, when Republican Senator Jeff Flake and the other senators asked for time for the investigation and for a week to postpone the entire Senate vote on Kavanaugh.
On Saturday, Keyser sent a letter to the Committee through his lawyer saying that he wanted to "by contributing to the additional FTB investigation" on Kavanaugh.
“But, as my client has already explained, she does not know Judge Kavanaugh and does not remember the evening or the meeting he would have had with or without Dr Ford,” says Keyser Lawyer Howard Walsho.
The letter further explains that Keyser “did not reject Dr. Ford’s statement and has already told the press that he believes in Dr. Ford’s certificate.”
"But the simplest and unalterable truth is that it cannot confirm it, because it does not remember that event," continues the letter.
Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge, allegedly near the attack, also claimed to have contributed to the FTB investigation.
Illicitly, Chicago's people tell about life with a corrupt cop and get him
The Chief Prosecutor of Illinois is trying to change the Chicago police history after a dark period.
A dishonest policeman is believed to have exploited innocent citizens of social housing and wrongly seized many people.
To date, 42 people have been unjustly convicted.
Ida B. Wells is currently only a blank site on the project's social housing site, and their people had previously spent more than a decade in the dog without fear of corrupting Chicago policemen.
They were headed by Sergeant Ronald Watts.
The residents accused him and his tactics of using assets, police reports, and imprisonment.
Willie's Martin and Cleonas Glober are two of those judges who have so far been tried by Cook County Attorney General Kim Foxx.
"If you didn't work with him, you ended up bad.
You were his enemy.
You prevented him from acting and profiting," said Cleona Glober about Watts.
“I was very scared.
I wanted to get out of that area,
But I didn't have to go," said Willie's Martin.
The lawyers of the Foxx Ethics Section shall review further 30-40 cases relating to Watts.
Ida B. Wells, the resident of the social housing estate Landonas Allen, said that many people decided to disagree about Watts.
"A lot of people didn't want to," he said.
"But this was not important."
According to another former resident, Clarissa Baker, no one believed in the people's words about the officer in official duties.
“He has his own profit.
Who will believe us?"
said Baker.
Joshua Tepferis, working on a project at Chicago University of Justice, says that so far no one really believed in them.
"They all went away because they didn't seem to care about them, because they were black people living in social life, so they were thought to have committed something,” said Tepferis.
‘Sergeant Watts sat in prison for 22 months in 2013 to try to rob FTB informants.
Martez Wise's also put in prison thanks to Watts.
I just had a son.
I couldn't be with him for four years.
He almost didn't know me because he was just born, so I had to re-establish my relationship with him," Wise said.
"I lost four years without cause."
For 72 years, Fidelity believed in the success of block chains, virtual reality and artificial intelligence
The potential of Fidelity blocks has been observed until 2018 when all corporations started talking about this technology.
Director-General Abby Johnson has led investment in cryptowaiver – the most risky and unprovoked asset class in recent years.
"About two years ago, I and other senior leaders were just the smartest thing that's going on, especially in the bitcoin market," Johnson said.
We started talking, and we realized that we had to find out.
Smalsumas led to the launch of the "cast" bitcoins in the New Hampshire department when the price of this encryption was about $180.
Last December the price was nearly $20,000, and, according to Johnson, "we were surprised that the prices were rising and we started to earn, although we never believed that".
It did not indicate how much bitcoins were "quick" or how much Fidelity was earned.
Fidelity employees are very interested in these technologies.
For workers, a block chain club called “Bitas and Blockes”, which organizes seminars and meetings with specialists, now has approximately 2,600 members.
The company agreed with Coinbase, which gave Fidelity clients the opportunity to verify the encryption balance using the Fidelity mobile software.
In 2015, the possibility of offering bitcoins was created.
According to Johnson, the company rejected most of the other possible uses of bitcoins or at least rejected them for a short time.
We're trying to monitor the market.
Until now, Katie Chase, the chief technology center strategy for Fidelity and the Incubator of Block Chains (part of FCAT), is looking for ways to use public and business-based blocks.
Chase could not comment on specific projects, but revealed that there was a great interest in customers, partners and employees.
“Everything is very new.
If you enter into the information, you will understand that it is still being tried to find the evidence of the concept," Chase said.
We have tried to adapt block chains to different situations and we have learned a lot, but technology is not yet so advanced as to solve such problems."
Until then, the group said that it was focusing more on trying to understand the nature of these obstacles.
They try to understand how to calculate physical objects, such as works of art, the value of chips or use block chains in the supply chain.
"As far as this is not at the centre of attention, but I think you will finally be interested," Chase said.
Fidelity will be ready for this."
As an example, she pointed out the Pebble newspaper, which was completely unsuccessful in its trading standards, but finally bought Fidelity.
Its group created a programme for a smart watch, which was stopped after three years, when millions were gathered through the Kickstarter Concentrate Funding Project.
In the market, Apple Watch, Fidelity was ready.
It quickly applied the software for Pebble to the new Apple product.
"We were not blind to the fact that the Pebble newspaper was popular, but we wanted to be ready if people liked smart watches," she said.
"We got knowledge and were ready when smart watches were released into the mass market."
Earthquakes and tsunamis devastated the island
On Friday, 29 September, the Indonesian islands hit Sulavesi with a powerful earthquake of 7.5 points, caused by tsunamis and killed nearly 400 people.
There are a lot of wounded and the number of dead is believed to rise.
According to the representative of the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, electricity and communication are not affected, and it is therefore difficult to assess the damage in the city and in the nearby Dongal fishing community.
Students of California wear masks with racist inscriptions
As reported by the CNN branch of KGTV, this week, Escondido Schools Union confirmed that about 10 students had taken a poorly planned decision to demonstrate racism at a class event.
"We are pleased that everyone in our school is accepted and there is no fear of diversity," said Adriana Lepe-Ramirez in the report.
"We will not tolerate the promotion of racism and exclusion."
The report also states that the incident is being investigated by Escondido's secondary school, union officials and local police.
"The school administrators have contacted the parents and guardians of adult students and will be subject to criminal penalties," the report says.
According to a report from the police department, students from the school north of San Diego wore handbills with letters, including a racist note, and were photographed by the posters.
In general, the school approves records in advance, but some students choose official photographs of them.
The Union report states that such behaviour is "incompatible with the culture, values or history of Escondido secondary school".
"We must understand the impact of our words and actions and take responsibility for the decisions we take every day," Lepe-Ramirez said.
"Escondido secondary school continues to promote family values and unity-based culture throughout the community."
The former teacher of Cade's Panel told the KGTV channel that a harmful image was seen in the social media.
"It hurt me personally," he said.
“It may have seemed funny to them, but that’s not the case.
Only fools can laugh from such things."

"Sharefas has improved significantly in high school," the top coach Steve Alford told reporters last month.
“He is a high-level, skilled, athletic and will be a great member of the new team.
We enjoy the composition of this year's team, and Shareefas will be a great complement to it.
It has a good basis and will be able to improve at both ends of the site."

Before joining UCLA, O'Neala's last season helped the high school crossroads achieve a record score at 25:9.
Sarah Palin's eldest son is accused of violence against his father
In 28th, Track Palina was arrested for three offenses, including assault.
On Sunday, he wasn't arrested for family violence for the first time.
According to court records, the incident occurred at the Palinian house in Vasilo, in Alia, where Track Palinas wounded his father, Todd, before the blood.
The 28th anniversary of the Saturday incident was arrested for three violations, including an attack.
The court documents state that the dispute began when the man called to pick up the truck, but the father refused to give it up.
As explained in the court's statement, Track Palinas was arrested for instigation of the first degree and assault of the fourth degree and criminal offence of the fourth degree, and his father was injured in the face and head.
On the basis of the documents, Palinus has appointed the police officers who speak him as "prominent" and has ordered the use of no weapons.
The court's statement also states that the man was on the garage floor before being arrested.
According to the court documents, Sarah Palin said that her sons were “serious” and“used some medicines”.
It's also noted that Track Palina told the police that she had had a few bottles of beer before.
He was arrested in early 2016 and charged with domestic violence against women, preventing him from reporting domestic violence and possession of arms.
"When I see how my son feels about what he is experiencing when he comes back, I understand the other families that are experiencing the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder, and I know how the soldiers are being hurt," said the former Republican candidate to the Vice President and the Governor of Alaska.
"Now I better than ever understand that America's best is in need of a leader who will respect and value them."
Elizabeth Warren argues that he is thinking about candidate to the President after the mid-term election
"The time for women to march to Washington and to correct the corrupt government to which women must be led," said the Senator of Democrats, speaking in an address to the Holocaust.
"So I promise you this: after 6 November, I will think carefully about whether it is not appropriate to apply to the presidents."
Warren, who was trying to defend his position in the struggles with a Republican representative in Geoffu Diehlu, said earlier that I would not stand up to the presidents because he wants to pay attention to the work of the Senate.
"It is very important to focus on mid-term elections and to stop acting as if the only important thing would be 2020," she told reporters in August in a speech at the National Press Club.
"The next important fight is mid-term elections, and they are important not only in Massachusetts, but also in the country as a whole."
Warren has long been regarded as a potential candidate for the 2020 democratic candidate, who can compete with President Donald Trump.
However, it would be looking forward to the difficult struggle of the first elections, which may involve other well-known Democrats – former Vice President Joe Biden, California Senator Kamala Harris and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.
The third mental health clinic associated with post-mortem death in less than a year
According to The Mail, a third person has been killed in a luxury psychiatric clinic for years.
The television comics daughter Shaquelle Vidal (23) died on April 7, after spending almost a month volunteering in West London, Marylebon, in the Nightingale hospital.
Her boyfriend James Lyle (57) – the manager of the insurance fund, millionaires and former supporter of the Conservative Party – paid her maintenance costs for five years.
The next chief chef died almost six months after the high-level event Daisy Boyd (28th) was launched by Rose Gray, one of the founders of River Cafe.
D. Boyd died after his divorce with the heir to the publishing company Dana Macmillan (43) on October 5th, when he died of cocaine that was illegally introduced by a clinical visitor.
Two months ago, artist Alan MacDonald (61) retired from the scene of the filming, when he was released from the hospital four days ago.
In May, the Supervisory Quality Commission criticised the Nightingale clinic because it did not try enough to prevent illegal inputs.
The comics of the BBC "Mock The Week" were registered at Avos Vidal dukra Shaquelle clinic on 11 March.
Last week, at a preliminary session of the Westminster Crown Court, Queen Advocate Katie Gollop said that Shaquelle left AWOL on 29 March and returned to the mental state of mind after the week.
Mr Gollop, acting on behalf of Avos Vidal, said: "My client wants to find out what happened to Shaquelle <...>, who she contacted and what she was doing."
Ms. Lyle called Shaquelle "a curse".
“I know that Shaquelle continued to communicate with James Lyle and he was in New York at the time.”
At the meeting, Mr Gordillo revealed that on 4 April Shaquelle called him and said that he wanted to buy and drink cyanide and 20 minutes after this call "more than a dozen times", but nobody responded.
"I think further events could have been avoided if anyone had responded," he added.
On 5 April, the clinical doctor found that Shaquelle’s mental condition is extremely poor.”
After less than 48 hours, she went off on a flight computer.
The representative of Nightingale expressed sympathy for the families and friends and said: "Our clinical objective is to provide high quality care in the safe, treatment in the favorable environment."

"Led Zeppelin" was again brought before the court on the allegedly stolen "Starway to Heaven" guitar reef
"Led Zeppelin" was again brought before the court on the occasion of the "Starway To Heaven" song in 1971, which the group allegedly stole.
It is said that part of the British group of the 1971 hits has been deplored.
The Court rejected the 2016 judgment that the group did not copy the name of the other group Spirit.
In 2015, Michael Skidmore, a reliable guitarist, submitted a complaint.
It seems that the performance of the "Led Zeppelin" song "Starway to Heaven" will take a long time – as it does.
The group is once again facing the court on charges against the 1971 ballad guitar reef.
The US Court of Appeal rejected the 2016 judgment that the group did not copy the hit from the start of the Spirit music group.
The judge is alleged to have made mistakes, such as misinformation about copyright laws.
She was returned to the court.
Spirit guitarist Randy Wolfe's trusted Michael Skidmore filed his first claim in 2015.
The police raid in Michigan ended when the police officer passed to their suspected murder
The alleged population of Michigan in the murder of his girlfriend was arrested after the police received, which ended up passing him to the police car.
Adam Nolin is believed to have killed his girlfriend in Michigan on Thursday in 33 C.E., at 27 C.E., Tia Mae Randall.
He was taken to court on Friday at the hospital where he was stationed to the officer by a police car, because Nolin shot policemen trying to escape the road where they were going.
Nolinas has been convicted of five serious crimes, including assaults to kill and escape from the police.
"It is not normal to go to court in the hospital, but it is not the first such case," said James Maguffee, chief of the Wyoming Police.
‘The necessary treatment is in place, but the justice process must also continue.
Judges often adapt to the implementation of this."
Nolin's girl's body was found on Thursday in a mobile home in the Creekside Estates area.
Two children's mom was shot by one shot, and the police immediately found Nolina a suspect.
The police then issued a public warning about Nolin and presented a brief description of the man and his 1996 black Dodge peak.
The man was spotted in his pocket and walked into the speed of US 131 when the police tried to stop him.
Nolin and Picapa came to the concrete wall, then ran out of the car and let them run.
As he ran away, he shot at the platoon policemen.
One policeman sat in the police car and passed Nolin from the back.
The observer filmed the event.
She is taken to a hospital, but stable, and will remain there until she is released and transferred to Kent's county prison.
"This event showed that West Michigan policemen are risking their health in order to protect the community," said Maguffe.
"They took the man quite quickly and with the right means, and we are very proud of them."
Nolin is charged with a total of two charges for murder, he is also charged with the escape from the police, the transport of hidden weapons and the serious crime of using the shooting weapon.
He's still innocent of his girlfriend's murder because the investigation is still under way.
"We are, of course, carrying out an ongoing murder investigation, which we will soon finish, so that we can report it to the District Prosecutor of Kent in time," said Maguffe.
The judge commended the courageous man who had thrown his teeth into his house for the thief who had been robbed.
The judge did not appreciate the courage of the man who stood before the two criminals who tried to break into his house.
Although one of his thugs tried to ride him on a wooden board, at 63 C.E., David Oldham did not hesitate.
A man in charge of the university’s territory defended, beat both criminals, and brushed one of their teeth.
The prisoners fled, but after a mustache on Mr. Oldham's blood was left, according to which Craig Ford was found and arrested after four months.
In announcing the judgment to Ford, who lost his teeth trying to enter the house of Oldham’s 400,000 £ individual worth of Ormskerke, Lankasyre, the Royal Judge Clement Goldstone said: “You probably didn’t believe such a Mr. Oldham’s reaction – when you were trapped to see only the eyes and nose, you faced him at home, he broke you.
He also hit your partner, who tried to break into the second floor and jump off the roof.
On Friday, when Ford was sentenced to three years and four months, the judge said: “I hope you have learned two lessons.
First, there is no need to raise David Oldham, second, not to start with the police.
Because of your crimes, you now have one tooth less than before and you get a dog.
It's still a small punishment."
He added: “I want to congratulate Mr Oldham on how he reacted to your actions.”
Prosecutor Derek Jones said that Ford had already been sentenced to another entry in 2016 and had to be sentenced for three years, but had been released in a fair manner.
Mr. Oldhams appealed to the Royal Court of Liverpool when he heard a noise at home on 5 April about 19.00.
“ Mr. Oldham, who is a man - possessed man, ” said John, “has courageously left the house and objected to the accused.
Fearing for his safety, he struck him in the face, tearing him in pieces and throwing his teeth.
Then the other intruder jumped from the roof in front of Mr. Oldham, who instinctively smashed his face."
According to Mr. Jones, the co-worker took a wooden board and tried to walk to Oldham, and Ford said: “Kill him, he has thrown my teeth away.”
The co-worker told Oldham, "If you let us go," and he and Ford escaped from the crime scene.
On August 2, the police seized Ford on a trip to the Wavertree area.
The Forda blew up the police dog, and then this guy slammed into him.
It's supposed to be the second break-in still open.
Fordas admitted his guilt for breaking in, killing and dangerous driving, although this was forbidden to him and he did not have a driver's license.
The criticism of these activists made to Johnson came with applause.
Such activists today buried Boris Johnson when he was expelled “with a dark and aggressive man. ”
P Johnson, attempting to persuade ordinary people in his compromises about Brexit, called for a strong assessment by former Minister of Commerce Digby Jones, who was also in favour of the Birmingham conference this afternoon.
David Davis also attacked Mr. Johnson because he was concerned about the headlines, not about strong politics.
Speaking to MailOnline, the union member in the Cabinet of Ministers, Mr May, added that he was simply 'crazy' because he could not be a full leader.
The opposition was called upon when the former Secretary of Foreign Affairs again attacked the Prime Minister's Chequers plan and called it "unreasonable" and "totally absurd".
Mr Johnson also said that he had a strong faith in the project, and that was what she did two years ago in the referendum.
It also called on the government to support ambitious projects such as the bridge between the construction of Northern Ireland and Scotland.
However, Mr May refused to be criticized for playing political games and claimed that he was not bluffing and is prepared for difficult negotiations with the EU.
In an interview with Andrew Marro BBC, which started their conference, Mr. May said, "I believe in Brexit."
Former Lebanese Trade Minister Lord Jones, now acting independently, called for mine approval in hearing Brexito's perspectives.
People felt that he had expressed his opinion on Mr Johnson, who had probably responded to the questions of the concerned businessmen.
In particular, without mention of Mr. Johnson, Lord Jones allowed him to understand that he is “a poor and aggressive man. ”
"The business is very important, therefore, by saying "velniop business", the former secretary of foreign affairs showed that there is really a poor and aggressive man," he said.
"I totally disagree with him."
Lord Jones also praised his speech in the hall when he heard a response from Mr May to the Zalcburg leaders at the meeting of the EU leaders to her cabinet plan.
The Scottish leader Ruth Davidson also once criticized Mr Johnson, recalling that he was a high-ranking government official during the Brexit negotiations.
Mr May, an ally in the Cabinet of Ministers, said to MailOnline that the intervention was not very serious and Mr Johnson did not have enough supporters in the House to be able to avoid the Prime Minister.
They said: “Now such news is not very dangerous.
He is noisy, but he does not have enough support in the parliamentary party, and he knows that himself.
We see the sharp contrast between David Davis, who respectfully expressed his opinion, and Boris, meeting his personal ambitions."
Business Secretary Greg Clarks criticized Mr Johnson, who attacked the businessmen who were skeptically looking at Brexit.
Speaking at their conference in Birmingham, Mr. Clarkes said that Mr. Johnson was "totally wrong".
He said: “I am amazed that someone in general can think that way.
There is no successful economy in the world that does not have successful flourishing companies."
In an interview with Sky News, Ridge on Sunday, Mr. Davis acknowledged that the coming months would be difficult, as the EU's efforts to make the United Kingdom have many advantages.
However, he believes that the government must not compromise and reach a similar agreement to the Canadian Treaty, rather than the one proposed by the Cabinet of Ministers.
When asked how Mr. Johnson managed to lead the towers, he did not miss out on the opportunity to capture the former Secretary of Foreign Affairs.
With Mr Johnson's proposal to put a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, he said: "One of the shortcomings of British policy is a fantastic idea for politicians."
He added: “Our communication is chaotic, and many of his ideas fit the headlines, but not solid politics.”
Bulgaria has spent £80 million on poorly restored European taxpayers' money
Bulgaria has spent £80 million in European taxpayers' money on poor old-school restaurants, which now seem to be built from "silver and cardboard".
The Balkan country has released £80 million from the European Regional Development Fund.
Instead of returning to the previous size, the restaurant was in a state of shock.
The Krakra country's local government has promised to reinstate the untrustworthy works.
The Bulgarian government has released ten million EUs for a non-profit-making medieval castle restaurant.
The Balkan country has released £80 million from the European Regional Development Fund for the restoration of old castles and fortressmen, but instead of returning their previous size, it has become a habit of building.
Relics that have fallen after expensive reconstructions seem to be built from "silver and cardboard", therefore no longer attractive to tourists.
For example, memorialists found that the medieval fortress of the western town of Pernik in Bulgaria and Trayanov Vrata Romani fort was reconstructed by using polymeric concrete, often used as a basis.
According to The Telegraph, the EU-Bulgaria government has privately agreed that lessons should be learned from this failure.
"The fortress is surrounded by state," said architect and memorial guard Stella Duleva about Trayanov Vrata.
It took 16 centuries, and now it's damaged."
Such reactions were received after the restaurant in Pernik Krakra fort, and the local government promised to remove the part delivered in 2019.
The fortress of Pernik has been removed from the “pilim from the cardboard” due to unexpected modifications.
The Byzantine Yailata fort is built in a "silver of cheese", because it has been restored from golden white blocks that are not related to the face of the air conditions.
These unsuccessful efforts coincide with new doubts about how the European Union is using the development funds.
Stylish bunnies for the ride to this year's "Distinguished Gentleman's Ride" event
Stylish motorcycles from all over the United Kingdom go to streets on vintage motorcycles to collect money for the Movember fund.
The event is called the "Kilnaus géntelmen's trip" and is organised annually to collect money and raise public awareness about prostate cancer.
This year the bakers market in London and in 40 other United Kingdom places, including Manchester, Cardiff and Edinburgh.
This year's "Distinguished Gentleman's Ride" events take place in the United Kingdom and 650 other cities in the world and have managed to collect more than $5.5 million (£4.2 million).
The official event's website says that this year's 120,000 people are "skinned with bunny bunnies, barefooted bones, curtled suit, sat on their classic and vintage motorcycles and allowed to collect money and raise awareness about men's health, specifically prostate cancer and men's mental health".
The "Distinguisshed Gentleman's Ride" event was first organized by Mark Hawks in Sydney, Australia.
The idea was inspired by a picture of Dono Draperio’s performance in the series “Mad Men”, where he sits on the classic motorcycle with the best in his line.
In London this year, hundreds of barbers, including the dog of the taxi race, were riding at the Tower Bridge.
Teniso axis Boris Beckeris was diagnosed with skin cancer
Boris Becker thanked the doctors for the successful removal of skin cancer.
Becker’s pictures are almost visible a small patch to the sunglasses.
"It was an ordinary check and it seems worse than it really is," he said to the German newspaper.
When it was discovered that it was treated with skin cancer, the tennis legend Boris Beckeris was photographed with a patch on his nose.
On Wednesday he published a message in German on Twitter about his health: "I want to thank Martini Mayr-Brune and Dr. Kati Maier from Munich who managed to cure me."
On Sunday in pictures of 50 years of age, you can see a small patch at the sunglasses.
"I visited a dermatologist on the morning who removed me from basic cell carcinoma," Beckeris told the German magazine Image.
"It was an ordinary check and it seems worse than it really is."
Base cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer in 75% of cases.
When time is set, there is a great probability of success.
Becker is currently different with Lilly Becker (42 C.E.), and they reported divorces in May.
The tennis star has won six important awards in the unit competitions, 13 Masters Series titles and the Olympic gold medal in the double match.
He has recently been observed having fun with his friends at the 185th "Octoberfest" Munich.
A 24-year-old piece of work on an unknown train platform caused by the body’s volume
On the train platform, the unidentified British entrant decided not to comply.
Jessica Mayho, who won the silver medal this year at the British athlete's championship, said he was robbed on Friday morning at Lids Station.
At age 24 and five, 11 inches [11 cm] in height, Mr. Mayho said that he was forced to wait for the train and that he was bitten by the man.
About 5:00 p.m. on the platform, a man who was assaulted took her out as a "big".
The rising sports star, however, aimed at the man’s return to the Tokyo Olympics in the British team 2020.
“ I’m dead, ” said Father Mayho, from West York City, “until other people have lost their eyes on the full platform.
Such people can be frightened and forced to trust themselves no longer, but it is the MANO body, the MANO "mechanism".
After announcing his adventure on Twitter, the young athlete called for a great deal of support in the social media.
MBE ordered knight Andy's Lewis wrote: “Stora!!!
Maybe he's drunk with the blind?
It's crazy, Jesse, it's okay with you.
Don't let the fat idiot ruin your mood."
Gavina Gray added: “I’m crazy.
Not only because of him, but also because of the circumstances that ignored him.
I'm glad you're okay.
You're an example of a new generation.
You show that you need to be proud of yourself, and not satisfied can awaken!"
While working at Lids University in Mayho, he was interested in adolescence and was encouraged by one of her senior nurses.
Since then, she has been able to take her second place at the British Müller's senior championship, which took place in Birmingham in July this year.
She won the British championship medal just a month after winning the North Anglican Games.
He refused to comment further on the event.
If the account of at least 50 million users is broken, Facebook will have to pay £1.25 billion
Using a security gap, criminals could reach at least 50 million Facebook accounts.
However, a large break-in was reported only after three days on Friday.
Now Facebook under the new European Data Laws threatens a huge penalty
After a break of at least 50 million accounts, Facebook may have to pay a £1.25 billion fine.
The criminals were able to reach an account for a security gap, so much personal information could be disclosed.
However, Facebook only reported the breach on Friday three days ago, and it was not possible to tell how many British bills were damaged until yesterday.
As the search for the programme continues, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, who checks how the Internet giant complies with European data compliance requirements, has criticised the company after its headquarters in Dublin, saying: "The report is incomplete."
Facebook is a major penalty under new European Union data laws, as companies may be required to pay up to four percent of global turnover.
In the past year, Facebook earned £31.2 billion.
The criminals reached the account using the Facebook function "Browse as" allowing users to see how their profiles look to others.
Dead journalist and publisher Vladas Dargis
V. Dargis was born on 2 August 1926 in the village of Pakempinius in the district of Stone.
At the end of World War II, in 1944, he moved from Kaunas, where he learned and lived, to the West, settled in England in 1947.
In 1992 he returned to Lithuania and lived in Vilnius.
In 1952-1957, V. Dargis led the publication "Nida Press" in London.
In 1954 he established the Nida book club and led it until 1957 and 1983-1991.
The Nida Books Club printed the paper "British Lithuanian" (hereinafter "European Lithuanian"), and other publications of the Lithuanians of the United Kingdom.
The Nidas Books Club allowed the latest Lithuanian writers living in the United States, the United States, Canada, Australia, Belgium, Sweden, Germany, and the United States.
From 1959 to 1961, V. Dargis worked on the US Radio "America's Voice" (Munchene) dictionary, director, journalist.
V. Dargis worked for a long time in the Board of Directors of the Lithuanian Home Company in London; he was elected Director of the Press Department in 1956-1957, 1982, President of the Board of Directors in 1984-1986, was appointed as Administrator of the Lithuanian Press Office in 1984-1987, and was the Head of Lithuanian Home Affairs.

The following records are heard in the MG Baltic case: the accused interviewed Gabrielis Landsberg
The hearing was opened in November 2015 between the interview of former Vice-President Raymond Kurlianski and the former "worker" of Vytautas Gapshi.
Listening to the record makes it difficult to understand exactly what people are currently calling for.
True, the record says that R. Kurlianskis and V. Gapšys are talking about the Christmas celebration, several times calling the name of the current conservative leader Gabrieliaus Landsberg, but what exactly is being said is difficult to understand.
Claims against both natural and legal persons
In the case of political corruption, charges are brought to three legal and five natural persons: the Working Party and the Liberal Alliance, the Group of Liberal and Labour Leaders, E. Masiuli, Vytaut Gapsi, the former Liberal, S. Gustaini, the Seimas member, Mr Steponaviči and the former Vice-President of MG Baltic.
Assuming that the working party has an impact on the dumping and trade, the Liberal conflict is suspected of dumping, trading and abuse, while MG Baltic is alleged to have an impact on the acquisition and trading of these parties.
The officials suspect that the politicians have taken or have spoken on the cause of the riots with MG Baltic Vice-President Kurlianski, and subsequently proposed or supported the group's initiatives in the Seim and other institutions.
The former President of the Liberal Alliance, Mr Masulis, is suspected of having an effect on trade, harassment and illegal enrichment, the former vice-president of this party, Mr Steponavic, and the former member of the Vilnius City Council, Mr Gustaini.
V. Gapšys is suspected of the effects of counterfeiting and trade, Mr Kurlianskis - of the effects of paper and trade.
Question: Who has the greatest opportunity to win the second presidential election?
Four candidates in the poll on the second round of elections - economist Gitan Nauseda, the unpublished minister Saulius Skvernelis and two of the Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) party candidates - Seimom Member Ingrid Šimonytė and diplomat Vygaudas Ushakas were included in the poll.
True, on Sunday it turned out that the TS-LCD had received support in the elections by I. Šimonytė, and V. Usackas withdrew from the election struggle.
As the figures show, if the elections were to take place in the near future, in all cases the second President's tour would win Mr Nauseda, but the leader of "Vilmorus", sociologist Vladas Gaidys said that it is too early to draw conclusions.
"Distinct (from other - DELFI) Naused, but it is very important to watch whether the parties are talking or about people who are dynamic.
These were the doubles of Shimonyta from study to study, and Nauseda was stopped growth, and Usacko was even reduced.
This growth is very important to you," says sociologist.
Moreover, in view of the results of the survey, it is clear that a large percentage of people have not yet decided what they will vote for or think generally not to vote.
If the second presidential elections were to be held by I. Šimonytė and S. Skvernelis, the fight would be fought - for I. Šimonytė would vote 32.7%, for S. Skvernelė 30.9%.
True, even 36.4 per cent of the people replied that they would not vote for any of these candidates, or they did not know which of them would vote for, or in elections.
Sociologist V. Gaidys once again stressed that until now we have seen not a full picture, because all the candidates who would apply to the less successful Lithuanian electorate have not yet been published.
"If we looked at last year's elections, there are many parties in Lithuania, where are their candidates?
For example, where's the candidate for social democrats?
When you publish it, you will see how his opportunities relate to other candidates.
So that side of Lithuania, which is less successful until it is less reflected," said V. Gaidys.
In turn, a politician from the University of Vilnius Institute of International Relations and Political Sciences (UU TSPMI) Majvydas Jastramskis says that it is still very early to draw conclusions, and all three candidates, who have rejected V. Usack after the fight, seem to be surrounded.
"I can say from my research experience that these differences mean nothing.
The difference between 5 percentage points does not really show any candidate's advantage.
The only thing I could see was that Nauseda would look good against Ushaka again, if those people were really coming to vote.
Naused against Skvernel also looks good, but we now compare apples and potatoes because, for example, Nauseda has already announced that he will participate, Skvernelis has not been published.
In addition, the poll took place before the first conservative election, how would it look after them?" says a polytologist.
According to him, Mr Nauseda has a small plus, but when all the candidates have been announced, he may be covered.
"The situation is quite the same.
Naused, Skvernelis, Shimonytė - results for the surroundings.
I would like to remind you that after half a year before the 2003 presidential election, Roland Paks had 5% support to vote for it and then won the election.
It's impossible to make any predictions," said Mr Jastramski.
DELFI recalls that in the presidential elections candidates have already been announced by economist G. Nauseda, Seimas Member I. Šimonytė, philosopher Arvydas Juozaitis, economist, Seimas Member Aušra Maldeikienė, Member of the Liberal Alliance Peter Austrevičius, Member of the Seimas Naglis Pudeis and Member of the European Parliament Valentinas Mazuronis.
Iran accuses Israel of attempting to set up a cyberattack
"The regime whose use of cyber weapon history is clear from such cases as (computer virus) Stuxnet (disclosure), this time tried to damage the Iranian communications infrastructure," - via Twitter, Minister of Information Mohammad Javad Azari Jéromi wrote.
He was referring to the attack of the Stuuxnet virus in 2010, which caused damage to Iran's nuclear facilities.
It is believed that Israel and the United States have established this harmful programme.
"Because of our technical teams' waking up, they left their hands empty.
We will continue to talk about this counter-action in international forums," stressed Mr J. A. Jereomi.
Deputy Minister Hamidas Fatthai said that during the days of the technical team on Monday, many attempts were made to interfere with their systems, but the attackers were "given a strong reprieve".
In the health club Impuls, the man did a bad thing and failed to recover it
The accident occurred about 10.40 a.m.
Suddenly, in 1945, the swimming man in the pool suddenly became ill, and he ran into the water.
The man was quickly pulled out of the water, but he was already unconscious.
He was tried to recover.
Soon after the emergency, the medical doctor tried to rescue him, but he was unable to save his life.
On the way back to the hospital, he died in a ambulance.
Antan Sakalauskas, leader of the Health Club Network Impuls.
"As we have said, a 73-year-old man visited our health club, Fabionskiu, with his wife on Monday morning.
Baseine's client flew for about 30 minutes, then came up to the pool trails to rest and suddenly fell after a few minutes.
On the other hand, the former people - the client who was swimming in the common road and the pool supervisor - reacted immediately, pulled him out of the water and began to cook.
The man was constantly being picked up until he arrived early.
The club staff immediately called for rapid medical assistance, which arrived within 5 minutes.
When the doctor arrived, he restored the man’s pulse and breathing and transferred him to a medical car.
While in the hospital, the doctors tried to stabilize the condition of the man, unfortunately, after 20 minutes we received information that the man had not survived.
We mean a heartfelt sense of the deceased man’s family because of his loss.
According to the original data, the incident could lead to a client’s health problem.
According to the information provided to family physicians, he has diabetes.
We note that in the face of serious health problems, it is always very important to assess your options in a responsible manner and to consult doctors and health club specialists.
All health club rooms in the pool are an awake supervisor whose main task is to monitor the pool, its access and ensure the safety of customers, and it distinguishes clearly from other employees.
Such pool supervisors shall have radio stations which can be contacted immediately by the administration and the registry, respond to their requests or request for assistance.
Four times a year, staff training is carried out in relation to the security programme - much more often than required by laws.
During this period, staff shall increase theoretical and practical knowledge, learn how to behave in the event of an accident, be monitored or employees shall comply with the rules of procedure and internal procedures.
How Portugal has radically solved the heroin problem
In the 10th decade, Portugal faced a heroin crisis.
Each Portuguese woman knew something that would have been affected by this dying drug.
Now, just a few decades ago, the country is proud of one of the lowest drug-related mortality rates in the world.
In Norway, the son died of Beauty: he changed even four families and no longer speaks Lithuanian
According to the LNK press report, four years ago, Lithuania lost the right to care for its son and to see him in the decision of the Norwegian Children's Rights Service "Barnevernet" and the courts.
Women’s history has led to an international scandal followed by the entire media.
The people made points about the boy's return to Lithuania for his mother in Lithuania and Norway.
However, the public did not help Gražina and her family to return to their son, who has Lithuanian citizenship.
Today, a woman relates how she has lived for the past few years apart from her son and how she and her child meet after two years.
At the time of the loss of the right to care for the sons, the boy was 8 years old, today the 12th, the beginning of adolescence.
For the first two years, she had never seen a son, which was forbidden.
Later, she was granted the right to see her son twice a year, just one hour later.
During the last few months before the hearing, the number of sights for Lithuania was increased to three times a year and extended to two hours.
Meetings with the son each time remind us of the sights in the hard-haired prison - watching officers and going to them - a secret operation.
"The son has changed even four families and no longer speak Lithuanian," - this Tuesday evening opens Beauty, her story - in the LNK game
Eligius will not be returned to Masulia for personal money taken through the bank
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal announced that the defendant’s complaint was rejected.
The decision is final and undisputed.
In the case of political corruption, former Head of the Liberal Alliance, E. Masuulis appealed to the Court of Appeal, asking him to return some personal money - the money taken from him and his spouse.
A total of more than EUR 242 thousand was taken from E. Masuille.
Such money shall be subject to a temporary restriction on ownership, and shall be continuously extended.
The last time the Vilnius District Court extended it on 15 October.
E. Masuulis did not ask the Court of Appeal to repay all the money - he seeks to recover from the marriage money taken 800 euros and its money - 690 euros, 130 UK pounds sterling, 1600 US dollars.
Former policy states that the last money was allocated to the US planned trip.
E. Masiulio's lawyer Mindaugas Bleuvas asked the Court of Appeal to return these money on Monday, because the spouses were working well and had the opportunity to have such amounts.
Prosecutor Justas Laucius asked the court to dismiss the complaint.
"The judgment of the Voluntary District Court is lawful and justified and no longer limited to the assets specified in the charges submitted.
The Court rightly found that there is a basis for confiscation of assets, as well as for confiscation of extended assets," said Mr. Laucius at the hearing.
On 15 October, the Vilnius District Court decided not to repay more than 242,000 euros in the case of political corruption to E. Masulia.
These money can be found through a rigid corruption of the past in the home and in the car.
The panel of three judges found that the substance of the case showed that ownership rights were limited only to funds constituting the subject of criminal offences committed to E. Masiuli.
"In view of the extent of the restriction, it is concluded that the right of the accused's property is not disproportionate or that the restriction applies too long," says the judge Nijolės Zimkinė, Jurgitis Kolyčienės and the Supreme Court.
The judges pointed out that in Case E. Masuulis is accused of serious crimes, the criminal case is large in scope and complex and therefore it is necessary to extend the time limit for the defendant's limitation of ownership in order to ensure the possible confiscation of assets and the extension of the confiscation of assets.
The prosecutors claim that former MG Baltic Vice President Raymond Kurlianskis gave E. Masulia a EUR 106 000 bag for the group's decision-making.
Both defendants believe that E. Masiul's finding money - 90 thousand euros - was the loan of R. Kurlianski.
According to the case, E. Masiul's cruise found 242.4 thousand euros, 130 UK pounds sterling and 1.6 thousand US dollars.
E. Masuulis and his lawyer have repeatedly tried to recover money, but the courts have rejected their requests.
Former policies have said that part of these funds belongs to other persons and was intended to invest in real estate or is his family's money.
He also claimed that there was no evidence that the funds were obtained in a criminal way.
Previously, the Court of Appeal has announced that E. Masiuli's claims that these funds could have been received by receiving more than EUR 100 thousand.
Legal protection claims that the remainder of the net money taken over by the crew could have been obtained from unspecified sources of income, not declared, not confirmed by documents, and perhaps no legitimate income.
In the case of political corruption, the charges are filed to three legal persons - the Working Party, the Liberals, the Group of the MG Baltic.
In addition to E. Masiulio, the case was brought against the former "worker" Vytaut Gapši, the former liberalist Sharūnu Gustani, the Seimas member Gintar Steponaviči and the former MG Baltic Vice President, R. Kurlianski.
Mr Kurlianskis is accused of having given a fine to former parliamentarians E. Masiuli, Mr Gustaini and Mr Gapsi.
The Americans recorded dangerous Russian destroyers
During the 25-minute take-off, according to U.S. Navy forces, the Russian SU-27 rushed right through the plane forward.
The Russian aircraft went through it for the second time, using the traction speed, and made a call with a background.
The passengers reported turbulence during the first approach and the shock during the second approach.
The Russian army has the right to practice in international airspace, but this interaction was irresponsible.
We expect international standards that ensure security and prevent incidents that are consistent with behaviour, including the 1972 Agreement on Maritime Accidents and the Prevention of the Sea (INCSEA), - the US military forces said in their report.
"Unsafety actions increase the risk of miscalculation and possible incidents", notes the report.
The Russian Defence Ministry acknowledged the incident, but believed that the Russian SU-27 was keeping a "safe distance" from the US plane.
Parental expenditure shall not be reduced further: a maximum of 50 euro per month for pre-natal activities
According to a survey conducted by the market and public opinion research company "Baltic Studies", a survey carried out at the end of August revealed that a third (32%) of parents of their one-school-year-old child "purchase" was granted less than 100 euros this year, a fifth (21%) was issued from 101 to 150 euros, three out of ten (29%) from 151 to 200 euros, and less than a fifth (18%) was spent by the school at the end of the summer-year.
The parents whose children started to go to the first class in this school year spent about 220 euros on average for their child's school bag, and the other parents who had already completed their first class gave a lower amount to prepare their child - an average of 160 euros on average.
However, the cost of running away for school years is low, as parents often have to raise money for their children’s boards and corporators.
Depending on the nature of the occupation, the price of one barrel in the country may vary from EUR 20 to 100.
Parents who have children of the school age were asked to tell them what average amount they plan to spend each month on their one child’s special job.
A quarter (23%) of the child surveyed planned to spend up to 20 euros per month, a quarter (26%) claimed to have paid up to 50 euros, three out of ten (31%) allocated to the child's nominal employment from 50 to 100 euros per month, and a sixth (17%) of parents indicated that it was planned to spend 100 euros or more.
True, in Lithuania, children of school age are given a non-formal children’s education basket, which consists of 15 euros a month.
However, these money can only be used by one board, and if the price of employment is higher, the difference must be covered by parents.
In the case where a child visits several boats or grows in a family a few children of the school age, the cost of pomamocin activities may be doubled.
As Dr. Justina Ambrasienė, the marketing manager of the consumer loan company Vivus.lt, says, a small or medium-income family can save children's beards, especially when a few children are growing up in the family, can become a small challenge.
When you start school, your parents turn their heads around, where you get money for practice, office goods, or new sports equipment.
Now the main concern is how to hire children after school without giving up the burden money.
We note that parents' expenditures are particularly increasing in August when it is necessary to prepare properly for new years of science, but later they remain higher than in summer, because parents are willing to invest in their own savings.
Often, when the funds are scarce and they are responsible for assessing their potential, they are cut and borrowed," says J. Ambrasia.
National Protection Officers Helped to Stop the Inflatable Driver
Last week, from October 29 to November 4, Kaunas police officers checked the speed of the drivers.
A total of 16 speed cases are recorded: 8 drivers exceeded speed from 20 to 30 km/h, 5 - 30 to 40 km/h, 2 - 40 to 50 km/h, 1 - more than 50 km/h.

The man drove 147 km/h, where the speed on this road is 90 km/h.
The driver is threatened with a penalty of up to 550 euros and the right to drive up to 6 months.
The flexibility of vehicle drivers has also been examined.
A total of 13 car drivers are explained.
10 cases of mild drinking have been identified, 3 to the average.
In addition, 5 non-blue bicycle drivers shall be identified.
On October 30, at 4:55 p.m., officials received a report that the car "Fiat Bravo" was off the road in the military police station near Jonah K.
The country's security officers detained 2 people who tried to get out of the scene.
When a person is transferred to police officers, the average alcoholic strength of the driver in 34 years is 2,03 per cent.
On 3 November around 4.50 p.m. Kaunas-Marijampolė-Suvalkai 6 km, officials, who noticed a suspected man on the road driving, stopped the check.
In 48, the average alcoholic strength by bicycle was 2.14 per cent.
The man told the officials that he had drunk two bottles of beer and was driving a bicycle.
He's threatened with a fine of up to 220 euros.
Last week, the officials registered a violation of the Road Traffic Rules by 31 pedestrians.
Inhibitions of 2 dangerous and chulic driving events have been identified.
Officials have also identified 6 persons driving vehicles but without the right to do so.
In Kaunas this year, 17 road users (last year before the end of November - 27) were killed and 693 were injured (last year - 591).
Kaunas enjoys the fourth toy bus
Today, the fourth exhibition of the mobile street "Atia old, good news" has appeared on Kaunas Street - a painting and inscription "Sienograph locks" of the old trolleybus.
The city of Kaunas was informed of the new happy trolley bus.
"This old "Skoda" also changed its light green color into a much more colorful and brighter garment.
She also shows the "Atia old, good news!" participant, - to the photograph uploaded writes the city's representatives.
Mobile street art shows "Atia old, good news" for saying goodbye to old trolleys, which will be changed next year.
For the next year, the old Škoda trolleybus will be on the way to a decent rest, replaced by 85 new ones and modern Solaris trolleybus.
The portal recalls that the first road drawing trolleybus crashed into the Kaunas street a month ago.
On the trolleybus show some well-known accents of Kaunas street art - an old man's pipe and drum.
Not a week after the first appearance on Kaunas Street, the second street artist Timothy Norvila - Morfai was born.
On the trolleybus is a smooth yellow car, which is often called a mere "vabalu".
"I wanted to invite the trolleybus.
This drawing looks very nice, especially because it corresponds to trolleybus wheels.
When you turn on the wheel, it looks like it's part of the car.
When we painted the wheels white, we made them look like a retro-style, it made a lot of mix.
Until the trolleybus tyres were painted, it certainly didn't look so funny," - as far as the portal kaunas.diena.lt spoke the street artist.
And on the third trolleybus, the painting was laid on 27 October.
It is frozen with white, yellow, orange, red, but mostly blue.
This color dominates.
On the left side of the trolleybus body there is one K.Donelaichi's house, on the right - central post.
"Wabalas" is my favorite ever," Morphe talked about the third trolley while scaring the artist Morphe.
Prince New
Kaunas Day recalls that last week Kaunas public transport company Kaunas bus with Polish company Solaris Bus & Coach S.A signed a 29.4 million contract, indicating that Kaunas will buy 85 new trolley buses.
"Cows spend throughout their history the largest amount for public transport renewal.
This contract will allow all of us who have served for many years the old Škoda brand trolleybuses and offer the most comfortable services to passengers.
New ground-based modern trolley buses will have more seats, efficient room conditioning and heating, high-quality information systems, video surveillance cameras, ergonomic driver's workplace.
New technology and parallel maintenance of the contact network and road repair will allow trolleys to drive more safely, much faster.
And, of course, modern design trolleybuses are very exciting for the city," said Mindaugas Grigeli, Director General of Kaunas Bus.
The first new trolleybuses will reach Kaunas in August next year, and all the old trolleybuses will be replaced by December.
Christmas sensation: Queen Elizabeth II invited M. Markle's mother to celebrate together
Hercogen Meghan occupied the British Royal Chambers.
This proves a special gesture of Queen Elizabeth II: the British monarchy invited Doria Ragland to his Sandrangoma chamber, the British media, to visit the mother of the Sassex hercogen.
Such glory has not even been called to Kate's parents.
Kate’s parents, Carole and Michael Middleton and other members of her family have so far been invited to the traditional Christmas prayer with the royal family.
The unlisted source for the Sunday Express revealed that the invitation to Dorija Raglabd is "the sign of Queen's respect for Meghan".
Doria was through the royal weddings on May, and the queen was taken "by her own silence."
The invitation to celebrate Christmas together, in addition, has created the language that D. Ragland is planning for a longer stay in Britain.
It is believed that she wants to help her daughters before and after her birth.
Meghan and her husband, Prince Harry, should be born first in the spring of 2019.
In the arena of Zalgirio and again of the storm show "The Mother's World"
After entering the autumn routine and the brighter hours, the 16th time the exhibition "Woman's World" is already being prepared - women announce the long weekend, because even four days of the hottest fashion, style and beauty news already here - November 8-11, in Kaunas "Zalgirio" arena.
Over the years, to see how the face of the event changes, the exhibition means no longer a linear purchase, but a tradition of giving time to itself.
Often it becomes a place for friends and a reason to spend the day with a sister or a mother.
Four days of exhibition has special power - every woman here can learn the secrets of magic, learn how to look for candles every day, find unaltered products, hear or test various procedures that inhibit the aging process of the skin.
All this and more, it promises even 415 exhibition participants who will be waiting for visitors on all three levels of the arena.
Three days will take place on the subjects of beauty and health, and on Sunday, the representatives of the artistic sex will be able to hear the advice to create an exceptional image from the lips of the stylist and journalist Victoria Girl.
Many women who are involved in business face extreme situations where stress can be prevented by a stable emotional and physical state.
For this reason, Kaunas's trade, industry and crafts for the Chambers of Business Women and their Network of Business Women, the birth idea is to hold a conference "Versli and Happy. Without stress", in which discussions and practical examples will help you in challenging situations and encourage you to look at your life more creatively.
Like every year, the exhibition features events for the masters of beauty.
The exhibition's long-standing partners, the Cyrpian and Beauty Specialists Association, will provide an opportunity to learn two days of hair coloring and modelling subtleties from the charismatic dute of the international academy "Vinokurov & friends" - S. Maslov and R. Sakalausko.
In order to further improve the field of the introduction of the river, the competition for the introduction of the art battle and the skill struggle "Art Battle", which will not leave the doubt.
It will be like the dawn on the cake that will become the festive feast of the beautiful world's representatives "Su birthday, Lithuania", in which the occasion of the century will be possible to develop an unprecedented show - from body painting to dances.
Another tradition of "Mothers World" will be forgotten - the presentation of the latest collections of designers on Friday's "Mads and Beauty Show", where you will select the most stylish.
And handicrafts will be waiting at the "Dekostudy" creative workshops, where you can create original works for the interior of the house or more interesting decoration gifts.
On the last day of the exhibition, all longcases are expected in particular, as traditional visitors will be delighted with the competition "World long-range LONG-HAIRED WORLD 2018", where new longest case records are recorded each year.
Prime Minister: after the introduction of the state payment, the teacher's salary increased by EUR 117.
Since September, the average remuneration of teachers in the country with a full workload has increased by 117 euros, says Prime Minister Saulis Skvernelis.
"It is early to say how much she (new order - BNS) has advantages or disadvantages.
The fact is that those people who have a full workload - their salaries have grown more than 117 euros on average," S. Skvernelis told reporters in the government on Monday.
He called the "democracy law" of the Lithuanian Professional Association of Education Workers (SPDS) to implement the strike on the issue of state pay, but stressed that the strike should not interfere with the education process.
"All forms of protest are permitted, possible in a democratic country.
If you think you need to strike, it's their right to decide.
You don't want to get hurt again to get hurt by children, scientists.
If the strike will be done, it must be done in accordance with the laws in force," said S. Skvernelis.
In June, Seimas approved the model of state-owned teachers’ payroll, which has been introduced since September.
The teacher's salary has changed from hourly to hourly - the teacher's status is 1512 hours a year.
The teacher’s working time is divided into three sections: contact hours, i.e. lessons, preparation for them and work for the community.
This reform, led by Andriaus Navicko, is called absurd, insulting that it has been adopted by the "buldozer" principle and publishes an indefinite strike starting on November 12th.
The LSDPS requires that this "minutes" pay system be rejected immediately and that a flat model be set up for up to a maximum of 18 contact hours for a single stage.
Also, compulsory wage rates increase 20% and reduce the number of children in classes.
In addition to other innovations, a new methodology for the allocation of training funds is being criticised, because, according to the professions, there is not enough funding for home training, to divide classes into groups, qualifications, education aid, and classes in large cities as they have been completed.
The Ministry of Education and Science stated that the state-of-the-art teacher's work would allow teachers to regulate the workloads of teaching and to pay for all the work to the school community.
It has been planned that, at the level of the teacher, the community will be able to work up to half the number of hours per year, the first two years of work, up to 40% of all hours.
It is estimated that the teacher’s working hours are 36 hours a week, of which no more than 24 contacts per week are required to teach the subject(s).
On May, the two-hour strike initiated by LZDPS contributed about half a hundred general education schools, vegetables and non-formal education institutions, about 1 thousand pedagogians.
There are about 53,000 educators in Lithuania as a whole.
Call to be ready: crises can be expected within 2-3 years
The slowdown in economic growth and even crises can be expected within the next 2-3 years, but both the Bank of Lithuania and the Government of the country are much more prepared for these processes than ten years ago, in an interview with the "Knowledge Radio" series "Business position" said the Lithuanian Bank Board President Vitas Vasiliauskas.
"Saying that the crisis is already beyond the corner, I really couldn't, but there are really signs of economic slowdown.
This year our country's economy has grown by more than 3 per cent, and we are planning an increase of 2.8 per cent next year.
The main message I would like to share with the public and business is that we are ready for everything," said Vasiliuskas.
He believes that there are no similar crises, so they need to be prepared differently.
The difference from the crisis that took place decades ago is that the government at that time believed that the income generated by the growing economy would be everlasting, and that was the result of the planned expenditure.
Therefore, after the crisis in 2008, the costs were greatly reduced.
Now, say V. Vasilauska, the situation is different, and the crisis is better prepared.
"It is true that the assessment of the situation of the Lithuanian Bank and the Ministry of Finance varies.
We believe that we are already beyond potential and that we need to press the brakes.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance doesn't like it," said the President of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania.
V. Vasiliuskas assesses the preparation of the country's institutions for the upcoming crisis of 7 out of 10 points.
According to him, a small and open economy, such as Lithuania, has a very significant impact on external factors.
The current oppression of the great dragons - the United States, China, the European Union - will undoubtedly strike us together.
That is why we must be very careful.
When the economy is low to say that we have decided everything, it is possible, but I do not believe it," said Vasiliuskas.
What lies ahead for those who have taken large sums of money?
V. Vasiliaus says the European Central Bank has clearly set up a short-term strategy, and decisions on interest change can be expected not earlier than the next summer: "This is the main objective of trying to manage expectations."
The trend, which is of great concern to the head of the Lithuanian Bank, is the reduction of labour in our country.
"The reduction of labour hands is largely due to a reduction in the competitiveness of the economy.
In addition, this is a reduction in the diet.
Migration has allowed this process to be somewhat balanced this year, but it does not know whether this has been a long-term trend," my V. Vasiliuskas.
ELTA recalls that the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance predict that the country's economy will grow by 3.4% this year, and 2.8% next year.
Swedish Conservative leader tries to re-form the government
On Monday, the President of the Parliament announced that Sweden, who has been a political leader for two months after the elections, will have the second opportunity to form a government.
Ulfo Kristerson (Ulfo Kristerson) is owned by the right-wing Allians of the four centre, who received a slightly less vote than the previous left-wing coalition of the centre during the September 9th election.
It was difficult for both sides to get rid of the majority of the opposition to the anti-imigrascine Swedish Democratic Party, which is the source of the neo-Nazi movement.
The first attempt by U.K. to form a government on October 14 was unsuccessful.
On 29 October, President Stefan Lofven (Stefan Liovnen) announced his unsuccessful attempt and finished his term of office.
In an attempt to force the parties to agree, Parliament's President Andreas Norlen said that next week he would propose to Parliament as a candidate for prime ministers, thus pushing the first vote since the government's efforts to form it began.
"It is not clear in advance whether the various parties will take Ulf Kristersson as prime minister," the reporters told A. Norlen.
However, he stressed that "the process must move forward and the dynamics between the parties must change".
"The inevitable negotiations must end," he added.
Parliament's voting date is not clear yet, but Mr Norlene said that it is the 14th of November between possible dates.
In Sweden, the President of Parliament may instruct any candidate four times to form a government to which Parliament would agree.
If all four tests are unsuccessful, the country must hold new elections.
The current appointment of U. Kristersson is the third test of A. Norlene.
Some of the Group of Christian Democrats of the Solicitors and Alliance partners pressure U. Kristersson to accept the support of the Party of the Right of Sweden, but he has so far rejected this opportunity.
The Swedish Democratic Party, which received 17.6 per cent of the vote during the elections and is the third largest party, ignores the long term of the entire main-flow party.
The ultra-secondary party, having successfully used the electoral anger of the voters in the elections after almost 400 thousand asylum seekers had arrived in the country since 2012, is calling for an impact on the decision-making process.
The members of the Alliance, however, are categorically opposed to such ideas.
Since 2014, the Swedish Social Democratic Party (SAP) has been able to cooperate between the blocs, but only if it maintains the Prime Minister’s position.
The Alliance and the Swedish Democratic Party rejected this opportunity.
A delegation of the Afghan Government to participate in peace negotiations in Russia
The delegation of the Government of Kabul will participate this month in international negotiations on the war of peace in Afghanistan, officials reported on Monday.
The Taliban still weighs on whether to participate.
On Saturday, Russia announced that it would hold such a conference in Moscow on 9 November, although the US is currently trying to enter into bilateral negotiations with the Taliban on the 17-year-old conflict.
The High Peace Council of the Government of Afghanistan, which is responsible for the efforts of the fighters, will send four representatives to the meeting in Moscow, the news agency told the AFP representative Sayed Ihsan Taheri (Sajed Ihsan Taheri).
However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan has failed to answer whether it will send its delegation to this conference, which will focus on the launch of peace negotiations between Kabul and the Taliban.
We are still in agreement with Russia's officials - said representative of Sebaghullah Ahmadi (Sebagtula Ahmadis). - We welcome any peace efforts led by Afghans.
The Taliban representative Zabiullah Mujahid (Zabiula Mudjahid) said that the movement still weighs on whether to go.
Moscow also invited representatives from the US, India, Iran, China, Pakistan and five former Soviet Central Asian republics.
Pakistan, formerly accused of aid to the Taliban, "will necessarily participate", said the AFP, representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Muhammad Faisalas (Muhamadas Faisalas).
The US Embassy in Kabul has not yet responded to the request to comment.
The meeting was originally scheduled in Moscow in September, but Kabului had been postponed to demand that the Afghans lead the process.
The negotiations will take place at an early stage.
The newly appointed US envoy of peace Zalmay Khalilzad (Zalmaius Khalilzad) is trying to persuade the Taliban to agree to negotiate on the end of the war and is anxious that a multilateral meeting in Russia could disrupt these efforts.
One U.S. government supervisory authority said last week that the Government of Kabul had weakened in recent months.
The President of Cuba, Pchenjane, met with North Korea's leader
North Korean leader Kim Jong Unas (Kim Chen Unas) and President Miguelis Diazas-Canelis (Migelis Dias-Canelis), both of whom have committed the abolition of US economic sanctions, agreed to expand and strengthen the strategic relations of their countries, the North Korean state media reported on Monday.
Mr Diazas-Canelis, who arrived in Asia on his first international trip after coming to power in April, returns to Pchenjan and his wife on Sunday.
He was met by Kim Jong Unas at the airport, and the leaders came to town to welcome them.
The North Korean public media reported that the leaders held negotiations at the Paekhwawon State Houses, highlighted the socialist history of their countries and promised further solidarity.
The official media did not provide many details, but indicated that the negotiating atmosphere was friendly.
The meeting with Kim Jong Unu could be seen as a warning to Washington, whose efforts to ensure significant progress on the issue of North Korea's denuclearisation are increasingly stringent.
Pchenjan, who has also recently been seeking the favor of Moscow, is holding a severe rhetorical meeting this week of US Secretary of State Mike Pompey (Maiko Pompey) and North Korea's chief negotiator Kim Yong Cholo (Kim Jong Cholo) in New York.
At the end of the week, Pchenjan criticised the United States for unresolved sanctions - a political tool that Washington also used extensively against Cuba and Russia.
North Korea is remembered to be able to develop the nuclear weapon programme further if Washington does not change the course.
The sanctions are an important issue on the agenda of Mr Diazo-Canal.
Last week, in Moscow, Mr Diazas-Canelis discussed a value-added arms contract with Russia of nearly $50 million (EUR 43.8 million) and received similar promises to strengthen political, economic and military relations.
The two presidents then issued a joint statement condemning the United States 'interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states'.
The U.S. economic embargo on Cuba, originally introduced in 1958 and then extended, remains valid.
The sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union for Russia’s pain caused by the annexation of Crimea and the support for separatists in Eastern Ukraine.
Mr Diazas-Canelis has to leave the country on Tuesday.
He's still going to visit China, Vietnam and Laos.

Record: Athletics in 157 days surrounded Britain
On Sunday, Britain set off from the sea to the coast of England, becoming the first man to cross the coast of Great Britain.
At 33 years of age, Ross Edgley (Ross Edgley) spent 157 days in the water and overcame 2,883 miles [2,883 km].
He was sailing six hours later, and he spent the night with his companion on the boat.
In the last mile, the athlete won the follow-up of hundreds of colleagues.
On the edge he went to Margeite in southern England - this is where R. Edgeley began his trip on June 1.
The athlete, planning to catch up in 100 days, said to his trusted neighbors on the beach, "Excuse me, I'm late."
He said that when he went to the shore, he felt relief first.
"I was very worried that my legs wouldn't last," said the athlete.
In the open waters of the world, the association indicated that during this endurance test, R. Edgley, supported by the Red Bull energy drink manufacturer, had repeatedly encountered extremely unpleasant air conditions, and had even 37 times exhausted the muscles.

Makabriška Kleboniški forest secret: one suspected already detained
It was a close relative of the past, for the murderer was a poorly stocked man.
Only in such circumstances was this crime known, since the victim had no relatives and no problem was reported.
According to the original data, he was not too old to be a full - time minister.
Just like the suspects killed him.
One of them was allowed to be arrested three months last week by the Kaunas District Court.
A second person who is suspected of fleeing to a foreign country where he is hiding from another criminal offence is still being sought.
Until it is found, lawyers are not inclined to comment more on the circumstances of this crime.
I. Valinskienė: I would agree with many of my children
In the new building's rock opera "Love and Death in Verona", the country's brightest artists are expanding.
The team of artists joins Inga Valinskienė, who has been entrusted with one of the most important works of art - a woman of course will play Juliet.
The important part of the team also became Povilas Meškela, who will care for the song of the artists.
"I think love stories from Shakespeare's time have been created a lot and very beautiful, but "Romeo and Juliet", apparently, will always remain a symbol of these stories and will continue to be held in various stages for a long time.
It will be interesting to become a part of one of these buildings," says I. Valinskienė after a new trial.
Although a well-known woman is well-known in the scene, she has created not one role in various performances or musicals, she has not yet played a role.
"The time to play Juliet has already passed," smiled I. Valinskien.
- In my time, I'd probably be pleased to accept such a proposal."
True, the character of the sacrifice in Shakespeare’s drama is no less important than some critics are even considered to be the most important.
The egg is not only an intermediary, an assistant - its way and tone of speech, a woman's attitude to feelings, and the resulting solidarity with the lovers gives more and more colors to the occasion.
In addition, it is also important because it is one of the only two women in the drama "Romeo and Juliet".
"The character of a meal is not very close to my way and style, but sometimes that's why I'm just curious.
To create a different character than it has - a serious part of the creative process.
I do not know what will be the final result, because it will depend not only on me, but also on the director's interpretation, - says I. Valinskienė and reveals that while at the site of Juliet's sacrifice, it would probably do the same.
- I think the kiss was listening to her heart.
That's what most women do.
That's probably what I would do."
The legendary opera "Love and Death in Verona" of Kęstučio Antánė" is created according to the famous drama of V. Shakespeare "Romeo and Juliet".
In fact, the work is based on the tragic end of the story of two young people - Romeo and Juliet - love.
The sad end of the story is unclear where the conflict between the young families - the Montek and the Capulets - has arisen.
"All history is possible at all times.
Parents who chose to choose their children have always been and will be.
Only today's solutions to such problems are different, asked whether the history of Rome and Juliet could repeat today, the future son-in-law of I. Valinskienė says.
- On behalf of my children, I would agree with a lot of people, as well as the Marches."
The main role will be played by the actor and director of the Ramūn Cicēn rock opera - Romeo and Juliet - Ieva Zasimauskaitė and Justin Jarutis, on the scene will also appear Vidas Barikis, Kęstutis Cicēnas, Mindaugas Papinigs, Marius Jampolskis, Paulius Shinkūns and Aidas Barkauskas.
The latest construction of the rock opera "Love and Death in Verona" will be presented to the audience at the end of December.
With the first new colors, the legendary work will be produced by Vilnius's "Siemens" arena viewers on 28 December.
The day after, on December 29th, the rock opera will be shown in Klaipeda's "Swift" arena.
E. Jankauskas announced with which footballers will complete the League of Nations tournament

In the national election, G.Sirgėda debuted for just 18 years, following the successful 2013 European U-19 Championship.
In Lithuania, the European Youth Championship, G.Sirgėda, scored 3 matches and became the most successful player and was elected to the symbolic team of the championship.
Later, however, the prospective footballer’s career was interrupted by trauma.
Two years after the interruption of the invitation to the election, another representative of Kauno Zalgirio was called to defend Mark Beneta.
In October, after spending October with Romania and Montenegro, the victims Egidius Vatkūn and Edvinas Gardvain were returned to the region.
"Let's try to figure out the first points in the League of Nations, although they're waiting for very heavy twin competitors in the squares.
In the homes of both Serbs and Romanians, we lost the minimum difference.
Failure and success.
Let us hope that the guests will be able to do so.
Although it is for the competitors - the fight for the first place group and the possibility of continuing the fight for the European Championship," said Lithuanian elective coach E.Jankauskas.
Until the end of the League of Nations competitions for two rounds, the fight is very reprehensible in Group 4 of Division C.

"Skamp" presents a song that has already refused to show one television
This year, the Skamp group referred to the 20th anniversary of the operation and again intensively began to create music.
On December 26th, Vilnius "Siemens" is the only anniversary concert "Skamp20", which is known to be a trijoule one after another, presents new works.
This time, it's "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" and a brave video clip.
"This is about love, so I realized that the clip should also be dedicated to all types of relationships, regardless of age or sexual orientation," - the new song and video clip idea reveals Erica Jennings, who is convinced that any homophobia statement in 2018 is not normal.
The new song "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" video filmed over ten different orientations and age pairs: "We always supported LGBTQIA communities and we hope that one day we will no longer have to discuss it," says Viktor Diawara, who created the music in Israel at the beginning of the year.
True, because of this video clip "Skamp" has already been able to prevent negative reactions - it does not want to show one of the most popular stories in the country.
That's a lot of talk about our society.
TV will not show up because people are fighting in it, and that is not the wrong content for children.
And that any day after the TVs are turned on, you can be placed on the screen of displayed masks and other examples of violence is the right content?" - retortically asked E. Jennings.
Erica and Willius Alessius: "I would like to see more hand-held and provocative people, regardless of their social status, gender or age.
We raise children and want them to grow up in an environment where there are as many tolerances as possible and as few as possible.
We want a new song and video clip at least to pass on the day of our listeners and give them a smile."
The Skamp group has been singing songs in bold, non-popular or opiate themes since 1998.
The best of all groups - old and new - songs will ring loud and wide "Skamp20" concert already on December 26th in the Vilnius "Siemens" arena.
It awaits all with their families, and children up to 10 years of age are free of charge.

Presidency: LRT is not a policy property
In order to return to the LRT for consideration of the conclusions of the Commission’s clear work, the Presidency is of the opinion that the leaders are simply seeking to gain more political control for the public broadcaster.
"The public broadcaster is a non-political property, and the essential principle is that independence from maintaining policies," said President-in-Office Advisor Mindaugas Lingė.
However, the adviser stressed that the opposite process can now be seen.
"It can be seen that the influence of those (politicals. - ELTA) is wanted to have more.
That is what we consider critical enough," said Mr Linge.
According to him, the proposals of the Seime LRT Commission are questionable and questionable since it applies to the independence of the broadcaster.
While Mr Lingė stressed the need to improve the management of LRT, it should be done on the basis of expert support and in the search for specific aspects of LRT's smooth operation.
He stressed that international authorities are already stressing that LRT activities should be supervised not by political but by competent authorities.
On Tuesday, Seimas intends to take a decision on the activities of the LRT in the light of the conclusions of the Commission.
These conclusions have led to many criticisms.
The proposals to change the management of the LRT are highly sceptical: reducing the power of the Council and reaching the mandates of its members with the mandates of the issuing authorities.
In view of this concern, the European Union of broadcasters has expressed concern.
The opposition group of Seimas members asked the Constitutional Court on January whether the special parliamentary commission to investigate LRT activities and finances did not oppose the Constitution.
Workers abroad - good news from R. Karbauski
Seimas began to consider the amendment of the Law on the Residence Declaration of the Old Ramūnos Karbauski of the Lithuanian State and Green Union Group to exempt citizens working and paying taxes outside Lithuania from the payment of compulsory health insurance contributions.
On Tuesday, 56 Seimas members supported the draft, with 25 MPs detained before 9th.
Following the discussion committees, the draft is scheduled to be discussed at the Seimas Plenary Meeting on 6 December. Seimas also decided to request the conclusions of the Government.
According to the proposed project, persons who pay social insurance contributions in the Member States of the European Union, in the European Economic Area States or in the Swiss Confederation are exempt by decision of the Authority for the administration of the State Social Insurance Fund from the payment of compulsory health insurance contributions in the Republic of Lithuania.
Living and working outside Lithuania, according to the procedures established by the Government Social Insurance Fund Board ("Sodra") and by the State Tax Inspectorate, the data submitted and approved would be considered as leaving Lithuania.
It's about services that people don't use.
There is an additional opportunity to fix the fact that the man has left," R. Karbauskis, from the Seimas Tribune, explained.
Such a proposed legal regulation, according to the Conservatory of the Seimas Antano Matulo, would be unfair to citizens living and paying taxes in Lithuania.
"Part of the Lithuanians who live abroad abuse that," noted Mr Matulas.
Social Democrats Algirdas Sys believes that this is how we encourage citizens not to comply with their obligations.
In his view, the health system would be free of charge for smart people.
Following the adoption of the proposed amendment of the law, persons who have moved to other countries are paid social insurance contributions, unencumbered loans, the burden of managing the Sodros debt.
At present, Lithuanian citizens who have actually left Lithuania but have not declared their departure in the Register of Residents are charged monthly for compulsory health insurance (PSD) contributions and, if they are not paid, debt is accumulated.
A. Duonela is convicted of fraud, but justified by fraud
The Vilnius District Court has left the sentence to appeal to the former distinguished sportsman Alvydu Duonės, but it is justified by the fraud of the documents.
On Monday, the verdict was issued immediately.
A. Duonėla sentenced to half a quarter of a year's imprisonment by deferring the execution of the sentence.
This year, the Lithuanian fear-of-judgment champion was tried by the Vilnius District Court.
He was sentenced to six months ’ imprisonment.
According to the judge’s complaint, the Vilnius District Court removed one charge, but the penalty remained the same.
The former sportsman will also have to pay nearly 760 euros for the Victims of Crime Fund.
Procurator A. Duonėla accused that in 2013 he had broken a purse, which had already been run by his wife, Dalios Burokaitė, to the office of dentist "Dalecija" he claimed 200 thousand litas (about 58 euros).
The couple learned only in December 2016 when they received calls to cover the debt.
The ex-husband said that he had never been in debt and that he had never been in debt for money.
With the conviction of Vilnius District Court judges, there is no objective data in the case proving that A. Duonėla would have recorded inconsistencies of the facts that it is not the debt of UAB "Dalezia" to A. Duonėla for 200 thousand litas.
The arguments in the plaintiff and his defendant's complaint are in line with that, and there is no supporting objective data in the case.
In this way, when it is found that A. Duonėla has only used the faked true document for deception and has acknowledged that this feature - the misuse of the fake document - is a complex part of fraud (in the case in question - the fraud of deception), A. Duonėla is executed in accordance with Article 300(1) of the Criminal Code, without proving that he was involved in committing a criminal act", writes Vilnius District Court judgment.
Firemen led the earth's shackles - the kneading heard the three days
As reported by the Kaunas District Fire Management Board, a report was received that three days of boilers had been leaked after the heat exchange.
The firemen also heard the cat’s crack.
It has been found that several days ago the heat track repair work was carried out here.
It is likely that two cats could have been closed to the ground during the crossing.
The fires dropped the heat track overboard, which was in the middle of the subway floor, and it poured out the space for cats to escape.
Antonino Scalia's son claims that his father's unbundled liberal protests about Kavanaugh
On Sunday, the son of the Judge of the Velion Supreme Court Antonino Scalia told the agency Fox News that his father's protest against the appointed Judge Brett Kavanaugh was not surprising because Scalia believed that the Supreme Court was too involved in the affairs of the modern world.
"In general terms, his very unfavourable noise on nomination to the Supreme Court, because many people are relying on Roe before Wade's case – at least as far as the left is concerned," said Christopher Scalia, recalling a case marked in 1973, after which the constitutional right of women to abortion was established for certain trimesters.
In the case of Roe, on the one hand, the rights of all states to regulate abortions themselves and some countries, in response to this decision, have immediately tried to restrict the right to abortion.
"My father often said that Roe v. Wade and in other cases the court really tried to solve cultural problems, although they had to be dealt with through the election process and the law publishing process," he added through the show in Fox & Friends."
"In order to speed up the process, the Supreme Court has caused even more damage, and therefore nominations to the Supreme Court and the dispute concerning the approval result in a more serious reaction, since the judges take the role of legislators."
The Senator of Nebraska, Ben Sasse, at this month's meeting on the approval of Kavanaugh, expressed a similar opinion, repeating that the Congress often gives too much power to the executive authorities, who are essentially unaccountable, and leaving the remaining bureaucratic issues to the Supreme Court, the judges have to take a job which the senators refuse.
The police arrested hundreds of protestors for illegal interference with the candidate's approval process.
Asked whether Kavanaugh could avoid adverse reactions due to unconfirmed sexual misconduct, which he had committed several decades ago, Scalia said it would probably not be possible to avoid noise.
In reply to statements that Kavanaugh should not go to the Supreme Court because on Thursday during the senators' inquiry, the senators reacted hot and sometimes indisputably, Scalia questioned whether all the judges were a peaceful character.
"The judges are often confused," said Scalia, referring to the evil disagreements that sometimes arise in controversial cases.
"True, Judge Kavanaugh must have reacted more aggressively, but it was different circumstances.
He tried to defend his good name against unconfirmed accusations."
On Thursday, a majority of the party's votes (11 to 10) were allowed to take part in the entire Senate vote.
Senator Jeff Flake of the Arizona Republic stated a dramatic moment that he would only give his decisive vote to Kavanaugh if the FTB were to be given a week for investigations into the alleged infringement of current charges, expressed to Kavanaugh.
The investigation is ongoing and President Shortas said that the Agency has extensive powers to be given and that it can question "only if it wishes".
Shiaparelli in a collection of ready-made clothing – fantastic work
Is Surrealism Possible?
Schiaparelli tried to answer this question.
The Paris fashion house, which was created by Elsa Schiaparelli almost a hundred years ago, presented its first collection of ready clothes and handcuffs.
This collection is almost as incredible as the famous Elsa Schiaparelli converts the shape of the boat.
The eccentric image of the long-painted fashion house appeared this time and how modern.
In aesthetic solutions, you can find sensations, tumours, hearts, and eyes.
Schiaparelli created his first combination in 1930, and was the first designer to paint the models on the floor according to music.
She and her friend Salvador Dali planned to reconcile art and fashion, and now Calvin Klein and Rafas Simons, who are working with US artist Sterling Ruby, took this idea.
A clever legend that Dali, together with Schiaparelli, had set up and ungulated the evening dress on purpose before the demonstration, wanted to throw out a real mayonnaise, but he did not agree.

"We wanted to return to the idea of cooperation, which is not separate from the story of Schiaparelli," said Bertrand Guyon, who has been working for the creation director for the last three years, speaking at the fashion hall in Vandams Square.
In creating a collection of ready-made clothes, he supported Schiaparelli's friend with Meu Ray and, in cooperation with My Ray's Fund, created clothes according to well-known works of art.
The sound of the artist's close-looking eye picture "Glass Glass" is shown on masks painted with Perspex tears, and red lips from "Observatory Time: Intimidators" are printed on a true silhouette dress with a collage.

One of Elsa's peculiarities was a pleasant attraction to the letter S. Their firm color – “Scokyating pink” inspired her perfumes “Scokyating”.
The first hand of Guyon was created by Schiaparelli with a key cap on the link called "Psaltis".
Its retail price will also be fantastic – £5,000.
Yesterday, in an old shop on the left bank, a temporary shop was opened, where the surrealistic half of Paris' fashion week was demonstrated and 100 € was available to buy Virgil Abloho's rides from the soon-to-be-show Ikea collection.
For a half hour before opening, more than 500 young Abloho fans sprang out on the front line, not trying to buy one of his works at a more favourable price than the man's clothes created by Louis Vuitton.
Ablohui this project helps to reach a wider audience than the one available to luxury fashion or designer furniture.
"No one has any property anymore, but knowledge of a certain chair can help to establish a conversation at the southern table.
That's what a thousand-year-old thinks," he said recently.
The audiences in the Marí area realized that this event in the garage would not be unusual when the models began to walk through them on the riders.
A collection of men and women’s colourful men and women’s masks, based on the portraits of Jessicos Fulford-Dobson Kabul’s riders, was based on the men and women’s paintings by the man’s designer Andreas Kronthaler.
Some high - sounding sandal women (and several men) drove by riders, but the covered high - watering platform was on their own.
Westwood, following the show in the first line and wearing the collection dress with horse’s motives and orange tapestries, joined her husband’s flower beauty to the last sunset on the podium.
Strong double-link in photos
Detroit was born and Peter Zelewskis, who lived in London, was already a street photographer when he started photographing two years ago.
"As a portrait photographer and man, I have always been fascinated by the twins and the strange connection they all talk about," he says.
The photographer did not plan to create the whole project, but he says, "after photographing the first two portrait, I gained independence and there was no way back."
Soon, in the book "Dwyniai" in Zelewski, 44 identical two pairs of photographs and stories will be printed.
This project is more visual, he says: “It’s not a documentary or scientific project – I wanted to photograph the effects and sensitive portraits of people.”
Employees have stated their lack of confidence in the trade union, in negotiations on wages
The members of the Royal College of Care, who were not satisfied with a trade union transaction with the National Health Service on wages, expressed their distrust after the vote and accused her of breaking the requirements for the increase in the fee that was expected.
This unprecedented decision was taken after lengthy discussions at the Royal College of Care, when former Secretary-General Janeta Davies admitted false promises to the members that their wages would increase by 3% immediately this year, when the 1% pay limit would be lifted.
After the expected rise of the salary, the members became angry and forced Davies to resign, then presented a petition, and on Friday held an emergency meeting in Birmingham, after which the board of the college expressed their distrust.
"The honest and open debate in Birmingham has helped to resolve the relationship, so the college will only strengthen," said the Director of the Royal College of Services Maria Trewern.
“The Council and the Governing Council of the Royal Service College understood the message sent to it.
In recent weeks, the Council has already made changes in the organisation and has tried to listen to the words of the members and to include them; we will continue to do so."
The meeting will be held next week and will be expected to be held by members of the Royal College of Services.
"The basis of the service is trust," the National Health Service's nurse told the Guardian newspaper.
"The actions of the Council of the Royal College of Services have undermined its trust, and the Council must therefore withdraw.
I hope that she will do so in honor and in obedience to the request.
It is interesting whether members of other trade unions will also seek reform."
In August of the National Health Service, the State official of the Joint Professional Union, Rachel Harrison, said: "The National Health Service employees from all over the country did not understand the expected increase.
That's what ruined them."
Before the extraordinary meeting, the Royal College of Care acknowledged that it had made mistakes in the 2018 negotiations on remuneration and had misinformed about them.
However, it is also stated that the Royal College of Care campaign on the abolition of the pay limit forced the government to withdraw this restriction and to promise to increase the salary by 6.5% within three years.
The vote was held after an independent investigation which found that the college was willing to give up in the negotiations and Davies was convicted of not being sufficiently careful in assessing the transaction.
It is claimed that the Royal College of Care has provided information that does not correspond to the facts and therefore the members were unable to take a reasoned decision on the transaction and did not consider alternatives.
The College has published conflicting information on whether all employees will expect a 3% salary increase.
The short report before the college's admission said that the planned "3% increase and increase in the implementation of the reform" was wrong.
In fact, wages had to be gradually raised to 3%, and only some of the highest wage earners would have been rapidly rising.
"The information about the implementation of the transaction was almost entirely incorrect (probably because it was being tried to simplify it)" said the representative of the Electoral Reform Service who conducted the investigation.
‘The ESR considers that the differences between the existing system and the proposed transaction and the main advantages, including 6,5 % and 29 % of the calculations mentioned during the campaign, were not clearly and clearly explained to the parties to the decision.’
78% of the votes voted against and 3.74% of the members of the Royal College of Care took part in the vote.
Lindsay Lohan shocked the viewers of the Instagram direct transmission by trying to "get" children from the family
Lindsay Lohan was criticised for the direct broadcast of Instagram, through which she followed the twin family on the street and tried to separate her sons from her parents.
Direct broadcasts, most likely filmed in Moscow (in Lohan's earlier updated Instagram story), offered to provide a home for the family, but the situation was quickly complicated.
“Good for all! I want to show you which family I have met,” she told the viewers, “the refugees from Syria, I am very concerned about them.
They really need help.
Do you want to come with me?
Let's go, I'll take care of you," she said to the family before going to one of the children: "Would you like to stay at the hotel?
Watch the movies?
It would be nice to watch a movie on TV or computer."
When his parents refused, Lohan reacted in a negative way.
"Your children should not be on the street, you should work hard and do everything for them to improve their lives.
“If anyone offers them houses and lodging, as I do now, you should agree.
They're coming back to you.
I'm not going anywhere without you.
Now I know who you are.
Don't mess with me."
When the family tried to leave Lohan on the street, the actor followed her directly through Instagram.
“Look what is doing is trade in children. That’s how you engage in Arab culture.
You're married to your children, even though they don't want to go with you.
Boys, don't worry, I'm with you and now the whole world sees us."
The transmission ended the physical confrontation – it seems that the mother broke Lohan.
Video clips spread in the social media and some users wondered if this could not be comparable to a trial.
The Independent met with the representative of Lohan for comments.
A third of British people believe that they will never pay off all their existing debts
Nearly a third of the British believe that they will not be able to cover their debts in life, and one in 10 believes that they will not even be able to reduce them.
A study carried out by Equifax and Gorkana, whose results were revealed only by The Independent, showed that the British, particularly members of the 18-24-year-old group, believed that they would have debt for the rest of their life, and that only half of them expected to get rid of it.
Last year, the report published by the Institute of Fiscal Studies states that the students who have graduated have a debt of approximately £46,000, while the poorest students have a debt of more than £57,000.
Most graduates (81 per cent) have never paid all their debts, so the first 30 years of work have been forced into debt.
Public debt is growing: According to the National Statistics Department, United Kingdom family debt is record-size and British spends on an average of £900 per year more than earnings.
However, is it worth worrying about this fear statistics?
Is it simply a new way of life for young adults (and society as a whole) to live?
As an example, cars that are another major buyer are bought at home (if such a success has occurred).
Auto Trader predicted this week that in the decade all new cars will be bought on a fee basis – this will be the usual way to buy vehicles.
EQ Investors Director and certified financial planner Jeannie Boyle believes that expectations have really changed.
“In these times, it is normal to have debts: popular credit cards, interest-free refinancing, student loans and fast credit”, she said.
"Our elders have sometimes been ashamed to have debts."
In these times, the debt of the student and housing prices has become normal.
This claim is also supported by the Head of the Personal Finance Section of the Interactive Investor, Moira O'Neill, who believes that the results can cause concern.
“If you borrow a large amount of money that exceeds your income four or five times, you may appear to have nothing to do with any additional debt,” she explained.
And that's how people get into trouble.
Interest rates have been low for many years, so people with large loans or other debts have to think about what would happen if the rates were to rise."
It should probably not be observed that there are no doubts about the comments made by the financial industry.
Brian Brodie's director of the Freedom Finance loan agency says: "Schools are not taboo.
Loans for home repair or new car purchase are no longer held by the latest exits.
Due to low interest rates, many people have contributed to the savings of time-consuming contributions from which a higher return is made, but it is not so easy to achieve savings.
Therefore, the middle class is increasingly borrowing.
Over the last six months, about half of the new loans have been taken by customers with a good credit rating."
Richard Haymess, Head of the Department of Financial Problems of Equifax, TDX Group, believes that such expectations – and not to mention the whole life of debt – are of real concern.
He says: “Inflation in August was the highest within six months (2.7 percent), and interest rates rose and jobs increased little, so it is not surprising that many people have a decision to borrow without a realistic plan to repay debts.
Our analysis has shown that this year the number of bankruptcys will increase by 17 percent, and the main factor is the record of consumer lending."
The debt may not cause much anxiety as long as a person works and earns, but it is not clear how unscrupulous debt will affect his well - being in old age.
The study of the Economic and Business Research Centre, carried out in conjunction with the loan for invested assets by specialists from More 2 Life, showed that people's undeclared debt has increased by more than a third over the last four years, i.e. more than twice as fast as the country's average.
This age group usually borrows through credit cards and spends 30 percent more each month than earnings.
Boyle adds: “More and more people are making the choice to pay from the pension funds at 55 years of age, and this will affect their life in retirement.
It is often the only savings that they had to save.
In addition, people think that the use of assets will go away later, but if the asset is transferred to a less expensive amount of money, it is not as much as expected.
If the price of the asset falls, this situation will only become difficult."
Several years ago, Serena Williams joined the I Touch Myself to draw attention to breast cancer.
Serena Williams released a video in which she sings the classic "Divinyls" song "I Touch Myself" with her hands rubbed with her nose.
Teniso's ass shared a clip on his Instagram page and explained that the video was created to encourage a woman to check her own breasts.
"This month, I wrote the World Hit "The Divines" version of "I Touch Myself" to remind women to check regularly for themselves," Williams wrote.
"So I came out of my comfort zone, but I wanted to do so, because this problem affects women of all races around the world.
Most important, it helps save many lives as soon as possible.
I hope I can remind women of that."
Williams continued: “This music clip is part of the project “I Touch Myself Project”, which is implemented by the famous Chrissy Amphlett – she died of breast cancer and gave us her hit to remind women first to care for their health.”
The project supported by the Berlin for Breast Cancer Network Australia (BCNA) was launched in 2014 after the death of Amphlett.
The video, published by the tennis star in his Instagram account, received more than 1.5 million reviews and many patients' respect for how the tennis player composed the song.
"I would like to thank you for this clip and your courage to do it.
Thank you, Serena," wrote one of the fans.
Another added: “Serena, it’s NOSTABU.
20 years ago, I was diagnosed with breast cancer and a tumor myself, even when the mammograms showed nothing.
It's just necessary to check.
Thank you for not being afraid to leave the comfort zone – you really are a ghost!"
For the project "I Touch Myself Project" Berlei also released a new sign of live skin "The Chrissy", which was inspired by the rock star.
100 percent of the profits received after the sale of the basket will be paid to BCNA.
It is important to know which signs and symptoms should be searched for in the self-test.
The signs of breast cancer are not only mucous membranes, but also altered breast size or form, rash or wound, separated from the spinal cord, skin surface swelling, permanent pain or changes in skin texture.
In addition, the swelling of the cancer may be associated with anorexia or a keyboard, a persistent vein, and an inhaled spinal cord.
Women are advised to check their breast every month.
If you notice any signs of breast cancer, NHS is advised to contact your family doctor immediately.
If you have been examined by your family doctor, your symptoms should be further evaluated, he will send you to the breast cancer clinic.
Adam Driveris forced the entire SNL filming group to evaporate
Adam Driver was this week's "Saturday Night Live" guest star and actually tried to make everyone laugh.
The best jokes are often not related to a specific event – as is the new exhibition called "The Day of the Year".
On the day of the U.S. high school, when the students bring up their father, and the adult Mortdecai (Pete's Davidson) reluctantly agrees that his father, the old oil magnet Abraham H. Parnasus (Adam Driver), would speak the language.
In Lazde, Parnasus, whose megalomanic personality could have inspired Daniel Day-Lewis's actor Daniel Plainview from the movie Bus Blood, describes how he managed the oil industry.
"I was born seven months early," Parnasus told his students.
“Incubator technologies were just discovered, so I was put in a cheese cup and heated in the pizza oven until I learned to walk.
My bones didn't shake like that, but not my spirit!
Be strong and shake your enemies!"
Davidson and his colleague SNL actor Aidy Bryant, who is a teacher, are just being uneasy and unable to look into the driver's eyes.
However, the actors of Star Wars only run away and he starts talking about the personal war with another oil magnet, H. R. Pickins.
"I'm taking your ring!" he shouts.
"I have filled her belly with my laboring seeds, and I have ruined your son, that is my final destiny, H.R.!"
In less than five minutes, Parnasus became the same remindr of Adam's driver's character as Kyle Renas of two films.
"Fuck you, H.R.!"
Killed by Kendrick Lamaro's songs: eight unheard songs appeared on the Internet
It seems that a lot of Kendrick Lamaro's songs have been lost.
On Saturday, eight of us went online to not hear the songs that were played by the parties SZA, Busta Rhymes, Jay'us Rock, Isaiah Rashadas and Abis Soulas.
It is not clear where the song is coming from, and the title of the set "Bad Kid Chill City EP" and the illustration of the cover (which is likely to be created by the fans) is not official.
Only demolishable and unfinished versions of songs that sound as if recorded at different stages of Lamar's career can be lost.
Gang Member could belong to the Good Kid Maad City era, and Heroin, combined with the SZA, was similar to the "DAMN./Black Panther" audio track.
The following songs shall be placed on the market:
‘Gang Member’;
‘The Only Nigga’;
‘For In Life’;
‘Loved Ones’ (with SZA);
Own This City;
‘Heroin (with SZA, Jay'umi Rocku, Isaiah'u Rashadu and Ab Soul)’;
"Look Over Your Shoulders" (with Busta Rhymes and Michael Jackson);
"Swimming Pools Alternative".
The Independent met with Kendrick Lamar's representative for the comment.
Dream about the music "Chikaga": In Klaipeda there are no tickets invited to go to Vilnius or Kaunas
Lithuanian wishes to see Klaipeda’s state music theatre music music “Chikaga” - does not pray.
For this reason, the most popular Lithuanian musicians of all time have been preparing for another tour across the country’s largest arena.
However, after about 1.5 months before the show, the halls have to be raised.
Organizers announce that all tickets have already been sold to music in Klaipėda's "Switurio" arena, and the tickets are quickly released to events in Kaunas "Zalgirio" and Vilnius "Siemens" arenas.
In the city, tickets have been gone for some time, so we invite you to go to Kaunas or Vilnius, where the tickets are a little bit more.
The demonstrations will take place in December, and not only will they see our music from beyond, but they will also have a great opportunity to look at the largest cities of the country," says Laima Vilimienė, Head of the National Theatre of Klaipeda.
The audience of Chicago will experience the change in the composition of the artists.
One of the key musical roles was first entrusted to the actor Tom Giaubi.
A talented and well-known actor from TV screens in Chicago will be the unique Billy Flynn, the best and most influential Chicago lawyer, without the changing people's fate.
As the music of Klaipeda’s state music theatre “Chikaga” is adapted to larger spaces, arenas, the composition of the artists showing it is also larger than the creation shown in Brodva.
In the Lithuanian "Chicago" there are about half the artists on the horse.
The main role of women is to trust the admirers of Klaipeda State Music Theatre Solitary Beatai Ignatavičiūt (killed Velma Kelly) and the charismatic Kaunas Music Theatre Solitary for Gabriel Bielskyte (killed Roxie Hart).
The Chicago music depicts the criminal world of Chicago in the third decade of the 19th century, which transforms the walls of the prison into a mountain of stars.
It is a musical satire of criminal justice, telling of two murderers seeking attention and recognition.
The music is overexposed by sexuality and irony.
No matter where or what the main heroes - Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly - the meaning of life - would be to shine on a shining star.
Their life is their life because of the message on the first page, because of the title, the glowing, the glory of the oil...
On 13 December, Chicago will be displayed on Klaipėda's "Switura" arena, on 18 December - Kaunas "Zalgirio" arena, on 20 December - Vilnius "Siemens" arena.
The ticket's on the ticket.
Website furniture in Kaunas
The website can be called a representative home area, where we allow time with friends, guests, and so on. Therefore, it should be equipped in such a way that it is not only comfortable for the owners of the apartment or house but also for the guests.
Depending on the size of the site, the walls, ceiling decoration, the taste of the hosts, the appropriate furniture should be selected.
The site should be not only beautiful but also comfortable.
Best help in inviting an interior designer, which will help to perfectly fill the space so that it is not overloaded or vice versa - too empty.
It is recommended to first establish the main site point, i.e. the item to which you combine furniture, other details.
This may be a witness or other important accent of the site interior.
It would also be a great place to create a chat room where guests could communicate comfortably so as not to interfere with the local furniture and so on.
Sofos, the chairs should be set up close to each other so that your guests can sit down and talk.
Thus, the furniture arrangement must promote communication, unite people, not distance them from one another.
Don't push the furniture at the wall.
The size of the room depends on what distance it should be from the walls.
Although the room is small, at least a few places away from the wall, do not push the furniture at the same time.
If the room is large, leave more space from the walls.
Actually, the longer the distance, the better.
Create a balance when casting the furniture
Consider the various details that will be on your website.
All elements must be mutually agreed.
The site furniture must be compatible with the interior details.
A possible small contrast.
It will revive the site interior, but it should not be too big, because the interior will become inconceivable.
We always consult with interior designers.
By creating the site itself, if you do not have the necessary knowledge, you may be at risk of deviating from the extremes: or creating a barrier interior because you are afraid to experiment, deceive, mischoice, or try to improvise.
Appropriate lighting
This is a very important thing.
The different light reveals the space differently.
The lighting shall be set at different levels: ceiling lamps, wall lamps, on the floor of the lamp.
The Public Prosecutor’s Office appealed a reasoned ruling to the LCF’s managers
The Vilnius District Prosecutor's Office has appealed to the judges of the Vilnius District Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling from the Lithuanian Carpsian Federation (LKF).
As reported by the prosecutor on Monday, the complaint indicates that the Municipality of Panevėži had no legal basis for contributing to the reconstruction of the private hotel in Panevėži.
In the pre-trial investigation, it was established that, in order to find the possibility of financing the reconstruction of the hotel, a public procurement and sales contract between the Lithuanian Carp Federation and the Municipality of Panevėži was concluded in 2010.
The prosecutors claim that part of the services provided by the federation to the Municipality of Panevėži have already been provided and could not be provided, since the planned provision of services has already been received or planned to be financed by the State and sponsors, part of the planned events has already taken place before the signing of the contract and has already been paid out of other funds, and part of the events have taken place since the issuance of the VAT invoices - the money has been transferred to the account invoices for the events which have not yet occurred.
The Vilnius District Prosecutor’s Office argues that the judgment of the Court of First Instance highlights the conclusion that the State itself has committed and ordered the Municipality of Panevėži to undertake private hotel reconstruction, since no State’s obligation for a particular hotel was made, only the proposal made to the Municipality of Panevėži as soon as possible to address the issues of hotel development required for the championship.
In the Court’s view, the Court found that the authorities of the LCF and the Municipality of Panevėži had tried to comply with the State’s obligation without having any legal means to do so, since the data in the case showed that there was an opportunity to organise competitions in other cities of the European basketball championship group, without prejudice to the law.
The Vilnius District Prosecutor's Office, in an appeal, seeks to abolish the Court of First Instance's ruling and in this case to adopt a new, criminal, ruling on seven natural persons and one legal person.
The Vilnius District Court on 15 October for all crimes committed in criminal proceedings fully justified the LKF Secretary-General of Mindaug Balčiūn.
This case relates to the preparation for the 2011 European Men's basketball championship in Lithuania.
Mr Balchiun was accused of abuse, fraud and other crimes.
The Office of the Prosecutor, Mr Balčiūnas, accused that he had agreed with the Federal Financial Officer and Executive Director on behalf of the Federation on behalf of non-conformity work - transfer acts and other financial documents and accounts provided to the new Municipality of Panevėži LKF to be included in the official accounts.
According to a case-by-case investigation conducted by the Office of Special Investigations (STT) of the Government of Panevėži, the funds of the Municipality of Panevėži may have been misleading and misleading for the benefit of the LKF managed by LKF and subsequently used for the reconstruction of the Hotel Via Unica.
The hotel manager Dalia Kuklierienė is accused of papering - it is suspected that she has given Mr Balčiūna television as a kiss.
All the persons entitled to justice with Mr Balchiun.
In this case, complaints were made to eight natural persons and to one legal person - the Lithuanian basketball federation.
Remote place of work - like Bermuda triangle
In Lithuania, the number of people injured or killed in work since 1992 has already exceeded the total number of people living in the city of Alyta by about 83 thousand.
If the specific physical workplace and its security requirements are as clear as possible, the new Bermuda triangle becomes the choice to work remotely from home, public spaces or even other countries.
According to insurance professionals, although the Workers' Safety and Health Act provides for remote workers to create safety and health conditions from non-differentiated workers of other companies, a variety of modern forms of work may raise a number of questions, the press report says.
In the event of an accident at home, for the first two days of unemployment, the employer pays 80 per cent compensation and for the rest of the period is Sodra.
If it is found that an accident has occurred during work - from the first day of unemployment Sodra compensates 100 per cent of the wage.
The assessment of the statistics submitted by the State Labour Inspectorate and the injury to BTA is clear that most accidents and various injuries occur at work.
Most of these are various physical works, where the risk of injury is greater: they are not being treated with devices or equipment, losing concentration or coordination.
However, there are also offices where most of the respondents, the best paid specialists, are now faced with their challenges that employers are faced with and the freedom of mobility that employees especially enjoy," says BTA Head of Human Resources Management Jevgenija Kriskzyņė.
The legislation in force in Lithuania recommends a clear regulation of employee duties and limits of liability, the definition of working time, place and functions, which also applies in the form of work remotely.
If this is done, it is easier to determine whether an accident occurred at work or not.
There are indeed many situations and nuances, each case being dealt with individually.
Employers are often heard of the fact that the employer is responsible for the accident at work, at work, or on his or her way to work meetings.
However, there are a lot of nuances and reservations in this case, so I would encourage both workers and employers to initiate conversations, to find out and to make it very clear to both sides what situations are really considered to be an accident at work, and to which the status of home trauma will already come," advises the expert.
J. Krischiņė states that, in these times, when working functions are often fully sufficient for a computer and mobile phone and a stable internet connection, the employee will not necessarily work at the place specified in the agreement and at the time specified.
Workers are mobile, they can choose to work not at home today, but to drink coffee in a cafe or park while enjoying the sun.
Is this going to be a job or not?
What if the working hours discussed are still not in line with the agreement envisaged?
It is possible to experience a truly unparalleled situation, in which circumstances the investigation will help to clarify the circumstances, the launch of the "Sodros" or the State Labour Inspectorate", says the expert.
In their view, the main difference in financial terms between the event’s work and the unemployment benefit at home is the amount of the unemployment benefit.
Mr. Krischitė admits that it was necessary to hear informally of unfavourable experiences, when employers try to hide the true circumstances of accidents or traumas and try to persuade workers to seek medical attention at work, to take responsibility for themselves, thus making financial progress.
This is an unfair, disrespectful attitude toward the employee and should not be tolerated.
On the other hand, the mobility of the people already mentioned encourages the search for additional instruments that could help businesses in similar situations: the insurance of the employer's civil liability for workers, the acquisition of accident insurance against injury, disability or even death, as well as the current and health insurance," says J. Krisčtīņa.

Lithuanian Regbio collection - Polish lessons
The European "Trophy" division of debuting the Lithuanian Regbio team is still hard to match with higher-level competitors.
The Trophy division in the Old Land is the third in the capacity of the six-nation tournament and the European Championship.
There are 13-18 field teams with a rating.
The Lithuanians started a solid victory at Šiaulia 30:10 against the Czech team.
And last weekend, Lithuania's elected public in Lodź, where it does not match Poland's election - 0:33 (0:12).
Although the Lithuanians were willing to defend themselves, the mines often violated the rules and the Polish governors were forced to strike the fine.
In 3, 10, 27 and 37 minutes of the sentence, Wojciech Piotrovicius gave his own 12-point sentence.
In the first row, the Lithuanians had to play without a yellow card from the Little People’s Party.
In the second row, the guests had several attacks, but they failed to finish them.
At the time, the ships were able to overcome the defenses of the musicians.
The stone was pressed in the accounting area by Mateusza Pligta, later by Kristian Pogorzelskis and Mateusza Adamskis.
In addition to several important directors, Lithuanian electorate coach from Par Ntdo Manyosha acknowledged the advantages of the competitors and claimed that such competitions provided a lot of valuable experience.
"Lenka played very well and dominated all the game components.
Our goal was to stay as long as possible in these games.
We just got up to this higher level and we have to understand it.
We won the first match against the cheques, but now we met very powerful competitors, and we had to recognize their advantage.
The Polish election gave us useful lessons," said a specialist from PAR, who has been standing at the Lithuanian election leader for four years.
Another game "Trophy" division Lithuanian games on 6 April 2019 at home with Portuguese or Romanian.
In this division, the Dutch and Swiss teams are still competing.

The Japanese coast guard is searching hard for the poorest islands
Esanbe Hanakita Kojima - such a name was given to the whole island in northern Japan in 2014.
Little, worthless and worthless island, which was essentially inappropriate for life, was very important to Japan.
So important is that its territory is now highly explored - perhaps it is still emerging?
Why does Japan need this island?
You won't.
It is likely that ice and underwater debris have saved this island for all time, although it has been almost two feet [2 m] above the surface recently.
It is almost certain that the island simply breaks down, but at least its footprints are expected to be found.
When the island began, no one knew exactly - it was so worthless that no one beat her too much.
Probably the first of Esanbe Hanakita Kojima’s initial knowledge of Japanese fishermen who sometimes used the island as an aid to visual navigation.
Their disappearance is not even a tragedy for these fishermen because there are better ways to catch where fish can be fished and where conflicting Russian waters begin.
That was the meaning of Esanbe Hanakita Kojima.
This narrow strip of land was the very evening inscriptions of the Kurilian Island.
This island chain, known by Russia as the Kuril Islands, and Japan as the Northern Territories.
The conflict with such interruptions has continued since the mid-19th century, but the full force was absorbed in the 20th century.
In these areas there are natural resources, but Japan historically believes that the islands should belong to it.
The point is that the Japanese have been exploring these islands since the mid - 17th century.
They first developed a map, took more detailed studies, registering a large number of small halls.
The agreements signed between Japan and Russia in 1855 indicated that the statues were in line with Sachalin and that all the Kuril Islands were in Japan.
So these two states lived until 1905, when the Russian Empire lost Sachalin to Japan in the war.
In 1945 the Soviet Union took advantage of the situation in Japan and opened the Kuril Islands.
Japan, by the way, does not mean large claims to the whole island, although it was the first, but would like to have four islands - Iturup, Kunashio, Šikotan Islands and Chabomayas.
Japan feels that it has a historic right because the island was first examined and belonged to Japan under the 1855 agreements.
In 2009, Japan proposed to Russia to divide these four islands by level, but Russia did not even consider adopting such a proposal.
Japan is quite close to the Northern Territories, but now the starting islands this geographical connection is as if lost.
It's said that physical marker about Japan's presence in those waters.
This is a major loss, which is why we are looking for the rest of the island.
However, even if they are found, Esanbe Hanakita Kojima will not meet the definition of a simple island - it must be dry.
This means that there will be a slight decrease in the territory of Japan and a strong decrease in the exclusive economic zone, calculated from the coast.
It's just interesting what you're expecting from the island search mission - that it's really not going to be that way or that way.
Incredible drama in Lithuanian and Polish boxing contests
It took more than a week to wait for the final verdict of the judges who became the winners of a cross-border meeting between the Lithuanian and Polish boxers.
Nine Polish and Lithuanian twins were held in Poland.
Four eyes won by the Lithuanians, as well as the Polish.
The outcome of the ruling was the final decision of the long-term panel of judges and the final decision of the competition secretariat.
The election started with the victory of the Lithuanian boxers.
The Lithuanian champion Marius Vyšniauskas (weighting category up to 52 kg) was sure 3:0 defeated by Jakub Sourma, soon Edgars Skurdelis (up to 60 kg) after fighting 2:1 defeated Radomira Obrušniak.
Two victories followed: Damianas Durkaczas (up to 64 kg) 3:0 defeated Mantha Dužina, while Philip Wachala (up to 69 kg) 2:1 praised Simon Banya.
Vytautas Balsys (up to 75 kg) returned to Lithuania.
Lithuania 2:1 defeated Bartos Golebiewski.
In the next battle, Piotras Szczukowkis (up to 81 kg) in the third round was clearly overrun by Eigrida Casmosi and the result was again equal to 3:3.
He followed the brothers to Jocula.
Robert Jakulis (up to 91 kg) 3:0 defeated Andrzej Kolton, and Arvyd Jakulis (over 91 kg) had to recognize the advantage of Adam’s Culinary in the first round.
Most of the discussions were held by Tado Tamashusko (up to 91 kg) and Michalo Soczynski's struggle.
The publication of the final outcome of its cross-border meeting took more than a week.
One judge awarded a victory for the band, two judges for the Lithuanian, but due to a technical error the point for the Lithuanian judge was read to Mr. Soczynski.
After a long battle, the victory left Poland's boxing man 2:1.
The Lithuanian and Polish elections were won at 10:8 (two points awarded for the victory) by the owners.
They managed to provoke the Lithuanians for the last paired-up blowdown.
In 2015 at the Marijampolje meeting, Lithuanian boxers won even five fights out of six and gained a score of 10:2.
The meeting of Lithuanian election leaders in Poland was a general repetition prior to November 14-17 in Šilutė.
Following the country's priorities, a new Lithuanian box will be formed, which will defend the country's glory in the next world and European championships.
How does the dog determine the direction in which the man went?
You already know the dog is very sensitive.
They can kill hidden explosives, drugs, blood, other animals, some even recognise diseases by smell.
The dog is well-known in films, but their work is much more difficult than you thought.
How do they determine the direction in which the owner of the footsteps went?
This issue is really more complex than you think.
The follow-up consists of three stages - detection, directional detection and tracking.
The second stage is much more difficult than the other two, since it is difficult to decide which direction a person took.
Well, there's not a second between the different steps, so their flavor doesn't really differ, is it?
Not at all.
As early as 1990, a study by the University of Oslo described experiments that led the dog to a 90-degree angle in the trajectory that the man passed.
Tests to be carried out on grass and asphalt.
And in many cases the dog easily set the course of a man’s walk, even when he tried to mislead them by the past revelation.
Can you imagine the complexity of this task?
The difference between the side of the traces is very low and in time it is further decreasing.
However, scientists say that it is not so strange - a dog could say and which part of the foot has hit the ground first.
This is because their tail is an incredible tool.
Dogs dominate the areas responsible for the ossuary (as in our brains dominate the regions responsible for the vision).
Dog nose has 125-300 million receptors.
In general, dogs are at least 40 times more sensitive than humans, but their ability to interpret different flavors plays an even greater role.
Scientists then carried out analogous experiments and with bicycles left behind, but their direction was much more difficult for dogs to follow.
This is because bicycle cancer is not segmented as a current human footprint, so it's harder to isolate different places for comparison - it's not natural for dogs, so it takes more time.
True, dogs are not the strongest owners of the bear.
This title would probably correspond to the loops.
Hundreds of miles [100 km] of white spots are followed by women who are ready to marry, and the rudder is about 20 miles [30 km] away.
In private forests, it is a promise to regulate alterations
Minister of the Environment Kęstutis Navickas on Tuesday Seem will explain about the drilling of forests.
At the end of August, public dissatisfaction arose over the forests in the Lebanese regional park.
The moon has been suspended for these forests.
The Minister has acknowledged that the labyrinth studies of Labanore have shown that there have been no gross violations.
The Ministry of the Environment, however, has already introduced a number of restrictions in view of the proposal by the working group to strengthen forest change in forests belonging to the State.
The Minister promises that other legislation adjusting forest rotations will be prepared by the end of the year.
It is also intended to apply the same restrictions as those imposed on public forests by private forest management.
Agnie Jagelavičiūtė revealed a strategy to build 170 thousand followers
We need to give people what they want, and at the same time get what they want, LRT TV plays "Culturally with Nomad" says Agnie Jagelavičiūtė.
According to the stylists, she gradually built a huge crowd of fans.
"In the beginning, I enjoy the taste of a man, he moves to himself, and for a while he's better at running that taste," believes A. Jagelavičiūtė.
A. Jagelavičiūtė has more than 170 thousand followers in his Facebook account - it has reached such a number using a certain strategy: "I'm at first comfortable with the taste of man, moving to myself, running a little better after that taste."
Stilist A. Jagelavičiūtė claims to be unhappiness, so he shows his face as he is - the authenticity and the ability to find the best way of presenting is the most important criteria in the social networks of popularity.
It notes that there is no longer any human culture on social networks, because many internet users are bringing up to them in order to get angry or to read comments from other people who are moving: "For example, there was a time in adolescence when I wanted to hang out with everyone and change - now I don't want to do it anymore."
"Truthful life is the most terrible thing.
And in social networks, that's a lot.
Feisbuke is even less than in Instagram," she says.
A. Jagelavičiūtė says that a specific message on social networks is about women's emancipation.
It also promotes the production of journals and looks at creation in its work.
"I can't say that fashion magazine -- pure art expression, but I know that there's really a lot of it there.
I believe that there is a lot of creativity in my work, as well as emptiness.
I balance - that's my key to those big numbers.
I don't want to create a real life.
Wherever it is better to give people what they want, and quietly to get what they want," believes A. Jagelavičiūtė.
One of the most challenging events for young people is classical music concerts.
Their popularity has been suggested by known people in the history of life: to talk about vices, failures, and life experiences in such a way as to remain authentic.
That is the strategy A. Jaglevičiūtė proposes to apply to the whole culture.
They say that culture does not have the opportunity to do anything to please anyone, to do no entertainment, and to show true values.
"How about a boring teacher against students - is there a chance?
If we don't find a way to present this art, don't advertise it, it's nothing.
When we're real and we're gonna get the reader, maybe someone's gonna change.
Once again, the second, the third, and already dependent," she shared insights.
Three people went down to the helicopter in the Lithuanian island north of June
A search for three people started in Alaska on Saturday after a helicopter accident north of June.
One man was saved after the Friday disaster, and the other three failed to be found.
The helicopter crashed near the Lithuanian Gulf, north west of June.
It was found that it was "Airbus H125" on a further trip to Grand Prery Texas.
On Friday, 100 feet from the shore were identified.
According to Associated Press, one person saved was 14 m.
She was reported to have mild hypothermia, but there were no other problems.
Two adults and two teenagers are flying in the unlocking armpit.
According to KTVA, David King (53 C.E.), Josh Peppers (42 C.E.) and Andrew Peppers (11 C.E.).
It has been established that Senior Pepperda is the director of the building of the Aliask company "Davis Constructor & Engineers".
I don't know why the accident happened.
The National Transport Security Council stated that the investigation had been initiated.
"I'm going to blow up a helicopter, which was completely new – just received from the factory – two adults and two teenagers fly," says the report of Coast Guard officials, on the basis of the KTVA.
It was found that the pilot had 40 years of experience in flying fixed wing aircraft and helicopters, including flights in Alaska.
According to Anchorage Daily News, a family friend Jeff Brodsky said that the neighbors "had not lost hope that a miracle would happen".
With the help of the coast guard, the rescuers renewed on 17 February 2016 the search for alpineists on the Nevis Mountain of Fort Viljame, Scotland.
On Saturday, in Alaska, three people were searched for after a helicopter accident.
"I've experienced sexual violence"
The president's advisor, Kellyanne'a Conway, revealed sexual violence on Sunday morning.
Conway noted the heated disputes between Judge Bretto Kavanaugh and his defendant Dr. Christine's Blasey Ford.
Conway, nervously, revealed that he had experienced sexual violence himself, and defended B. Kavanaugh against leader Jake Tapper, claiming that the judge was accused of sexual violence in ignorance of the adverse facts of the accused.
"I am very touched by the victims of sexual abuse and violence.
I experienced sexual harassment," Conway said on Sunday at the State of the Union.
"I'm a victim of sexual violence and I don't think Judge Kavanaugh, Take's Tapper, Jeff Flake or anyone else is responsible for it.
We ourselves must be responsible for our conduct."
Conway said that the news network must be ashamed of Kavanaugh's comparison with Bill Cosby, who was sentenced last week to imprisonment in the state of Pennsylvania from three to ten years.
Conway also criticised the Senate Court Committee because it was unable to eliminate former President Bill Clinton, who had engaged in oral sex in his office and lied to US people.
The survey showed that Kavanaugh’s and Ford’s evidence split the US society
The Americans do not agree on the evidence of Bretto Kavanaugh and his accused Christine's Blasey Ford – the defendant claims that the judge sexually attacked her when they were teenagers.
The number of people who believe that Ford or Kavanaugh is lying is almost similar: 38 percent of respondents say that Kavanaugh was probably lying in giving evidence, and 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
The Senate Judicial Committee heard from both sides when Ford sent a letter to Senator Diana Feinstein with full charges against the judge.
After publishing the letter, Ford and Kavanaugh said that he was ready to speak before the committee.
In giving evidence, Ford claimed that there were 100 percent true that at the beginning of the 9th decade, she was tried to swallow Kavanaugh rather than another person.
In an emotional introductory language, a 51 - year - old woman said that she felt a civil duty, so she could not remain silent.
"I'm very scared," she said.
"I'm here because I think it's my civil duty to tell me what happened to me when Bretta Kavanaugh and I went to high school."
Ford and two other women’s allegations of sexual harassment by Kavanaugh stated that “they never attacked anything in high school, college or any other time later”.
“All of you have tried to find something that would prevent you from voting for my nomination, no matter how unrealistic or crazy it is,” he said.
"That's the simplest shot last minute."
On 27 and 28 September, the survey conducted by YooGov, which questioned 2607 people, did not reflect the disparity between the opinions of the different parties: the supporters of the Democratic Party believed for Ford (73 per cent) and the Republican Kavanaugh (74 per cent), although Ford believed in more republics than for Kavanaugh (14 per cent compared to 11 per cent).
The creator of the body worlds exhibition called "Daktara Mortimi" wants to be cut off and demonstrated in his own exhibition
A German scientist who invented plastics died wants to become forever part of his exhibition Body Worlds.
Guntheris von Hagenas has devised an innovative method that allows for the demonstration of lavas, shells and organs around the world in the show, the expected and convulsions, and conflicting assessments.
In 73 C.E., a man who died in a prison ordered his wife to plasticize him after his death to become a permanent exhibit on Body Worlds, which will be opened this week in London.
"In that sense, it will be the end of his life's work.
Now I understand that I will have to do this because I will express my gratitude and love," Angelina Whaley told The Observer.
She said that the man gave strict instructions on what to do with his lion, and the whole process would take about a year.
The muscles, nerves and arteries must be removed, and the body must be placed in silicone and constructed in the appropriate position.
“He told me: ‘Angelina, it can freeze me for years to 25 degrees Celsius, but then you will have to add your hands, otherwise I’ll die.”
So I'm going to be able to make a year, and then I'm going to have to take it."
Then, in the most ideal case, he will join the exhibition in London pavilion next to other bodies hardened in time with fixed posts, such as riding a horse or playing cards.
Von Hagens boasted a broadcast in the United Kingdom through a direct broadcast of British television (this was the first public broadcast in 170 years).
More than 47 million people have visited the Body Worlds worldwide since 1995.
The founder of Body Worlds London, Peter Tabernalis, told the Guardian, that 100 percent of the exhibits that took about 28,000 square feet exposed to the gifted people who were "given consent because they wanted to save the living, light them and help them see possible problems".
“We see and read so many terrible things that we die.
None of us will avoid it, death is common to all of us, and I think that Body Worlds shows that there is no need to be afraid," said Tabernalis.
Ronaldo’s lawyers threaten the court’s appeal for prosecution
On Friday, the Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronaldo's lawyers said that he was going to refer to the court a German journal published by "probably illegal" American states that Ronaldo had taken her to court in 2009.
One of Ronald's lawyers, Christian Schertz, stated that the article in the journal Der Spiegel was "an unacceptable statement of private charges" and he would seek legal remedies for his client.
A statement was sent to Reuters by Ronaldo, representative of Gestifute, in response to a request to comment on a Friday article published on the Internet.
Gestifute did not answer specific questions about the content of the Der Spiegel declaration, which Reuters could not verify on its own.
Der Spiegel first filed charges in April 2017.
One of the most popular sportsmen in the world Ronaldo earned five times the title of the best player in the world.
This summer he went to the Youth of Italy from Real Madrid; the Italian club refused to comment on the statement "Der Spiegel".
The Journal states that the alleged expulsion took place in June 2009 in the Las Vegas hotel room – this was said by Lawyer Kathryn Mayorga Leslie's Mark Stovall, who filed the charges.
Stovall told the newspaper that Ronaldo and Mayorga had agreed not to the court.
Mayorga agreed to sign a confidentiality contract for Ronaldo's $375 000.
Stovall did not respond immediately to Reuters' e-mails about comments, and Mayorga did not respond to calls on the home phone.
However, Stovall told the journal Der Spiegel that he had filed a civil complaint in order to cancel the confidentiality contract.
Mayorga told the journal Der Spiegel that the contract no longer exists because it has so far felt the consequences of the past nine years.
"I have experienced a serious crisis," she said "Der Spiegel".
‘And yet, the charge of abuse.
I blame him and blame myself for signing this."
Sustainable business that ensures the independence of creators
Are you ready to try Self-Publishing 3.0?
The new White Paper, published today by the Association of Independent Creators on the "#selfpub3.0" website, explains for the first time how to connect to other entrepreneurs, become independent and start a sustainable creation business.
The founder of the Independent Creators' Union Orna Ross, which has not been recognized for the first time as one of the 100 most influential people, will explain at the Digital Book World 2018 conference why developers should allow the Self-Publishing 3.0 methods.
"The trends in advertising, such as the popularity of personal trademarks, the responsible use and reading of mobile phones, together with digital publishing technologies create very favourable conditions for entrepreneurs," says Ross.
However, only independent and creative thinkers and those who know their powers can benefit from these opportunities, who understand the value of intellectual property.
"#selfpub3.0" encourages developers to create several sources of employment through websites that create conditions for successful publishing and media.
It can be earned from direct sales, subscription models, concerted assistance, broadband models and other sources of income, such as online training and related activities.
"#selfpub3.0" also encourages the distribution of books in the most diverse formats for the wider audience using retailers and other services.
The main objective of "#selfpub3.0" is to encourage change of mind and to learn to manage your creative business so that the intellectual property, which is the most important creative asset, would not be transferred to another company without purpose, such as specialised publishing or self-publishing service provider.
According to Ross, this is how developers can increase their income, influence and impact, and these methods must interest not only every digital age creator, but also publishers; it also stressed that real independence of creators (as well as other people) ensures commercial and creative freedom.
You'll be here by now.
And its prospects for independent creators are now the best.
The book Self-Publishing 1.0 describes the computer edition and printing as required.
Self-Publishing 2.0 theme is the sale of e-books for readers and phones in online bookstores.
Now starts a new, Self-Publishing 3.0 era, in which independent publishers will be taught to start a business of perspectives and sustainability.
The Union of Independent Creators is the only non-profit organization in the world that unites self-reliant authors.
The aim of the Union is to develop the skills of independent publishers, promote ethical activities, help start-ups to sell books and encourage developers to pursue a sustainable digital business that will ensure their independence.
The presidents of the country and central bank warned the Italian government about the planned deficit
After hearing the populist government's plans to significantly increase the deficit expenditure next year, the President of Italy and the head of the Central Bank warned on Saturday that the country's debt should be managed.
The ruling party (opposing movement of the Five Stars and the North League of the Right) presented a 2019 deficit proposal that would target 2.4% of the total domestic product (GDP) and three times the previous administration target.
This report broke down the market on Friday and led to the sale of bonds and affected bank shares.
Furthermore, such plans are incompatible with the European Union, applying EU fiscal rules and monitoring their compliance.
When addressing the audience in the President's Chambers, which mentioned the 70-year anniversary of the constitution, President Sergio Mattarella said that, under the country's framework laws, "the budget must be balanced and debt must be managed".
"That's how we protect our citizens' savings," he said.
At a conference recently held in central Italy, Italian bank president Ignazio Visco said that the country's debt, which is the largest in all the economies of the European Union, is no longer being able to increase by 131 per cent of GDP.
"Italy must give priority to public and private investment and manage and reduce public debt," said Visco, on the basis of the Ansa public knowledge agency.
"School must be reduced consistently."
The Head of the North League and Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvinis replied to Matarella's words that the debt increased over the years with the strict requirements applied by Brussels.
"Don't worry, Mr. President," said Salvinis in a statement.
"The government debt has been drained over the years by the budgets of Europe, and we are finally changing our plans and seeking a better future and growth."
Earlier, before speaking to Mattarella or Visco, the Five Star Movement Commander Luigi Di Mayo said that the money stolen before would be returned to people" from the budget, but added that the government did not intend to oppose the EU or financial markets.
The ruling parties have pressured a non-commissioned minister of the economy, Giovannis Tri, to support their planned deficit expenditure.
The Italian media claimed that Mattarella supported the Tria's failed attempt to maintain a budget deficit that would not reach 2% of GDP.
The presidents of the country and the central bank have no direct influence on economic policy.
The President of 77 years may reject the law and return it to Parliament, but only once.
Parliament can then again adopt an unaltered law and legislate it.
Official information: Indonesia's tsunami sensors lost a huge wave
The Indonesian geophysics Agency withdrew the warning about the tsunami 34 minutes after its release, and later a severe earthquake struck the country, sending a huge wave to the north-east coast of the island of Sulaves, where hundreds of people died and thousands were left homeless.
Car dusts after the tsunami of Palu, Indonesia, 29 September 2018
During the 7.5th earthquake and tsunami, about 1,500 km (940 miles) from the city of Jakarta, at least 384 people died.
On Sunday, the officials said that the number of victims would likely increase.
On Friday, most of the people gathered at the festival on the beach of Palus, which was hit by a six - foot - high [18 m] wave.
The geophysics agency BMKG called on the social media on Saturday: many people were wondering if the tsunami warning had been cancelled too early.
The Agency claimed that it had carried out the standard procedure and decided to withdraw the warning according to the data of the nearest flood sensor, approximately 200 km (125 miles) from Palu.
“We do not have observation data from Palus.
We therefore had to take a decision according to the data we had," said BMKG, Head of the Earthquakes and Cunami Center, Rahmat Triyono.
The nearest sea level measuring the sea level was the only "unsignificant" wave of six centimeters (2.5 inches) and did not notice the huge waves near Paul.
“If we had had a floodgate near Paul or had received data from him, of course, the situation would have been better.
We must consider this in the future," said Triyono.
According to officials, the tsunami hit Paul and the surrounding areas at a high speed — hundreds of miles per hour, but it is not clear whether it happened before or after the warning was withdrawn.
The residents are checking the lava on the street looking for their family members after Cunami Paul, Indonesia, on 29 September 2018.
"As a result of videos distributed in the social media, we believe that the tsunamis occurred before the official cancellation of the warning," Triyon said.
Most of the damage caused by the 9.5th earthquake occurred on the second day of Christmas 2004 and caused a massive tsunami that killed some 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean, including 126 000 victims in Indonesia.
The picturesque city of Palu, where 380,000 people live, is on the north coast of the island of Sulavesios in the north east.
According to the Indonesian National Disaster Reduction Agency (BNPB), the city was seriously destroyed in 1927 and 1968.
According to the Oxford University of Geophysics researcher Baptiste Gomberto, the earthquake was not supposed to cause a tsunami.
The earthquake on Friday was due to a horizontal break – the close tectonic plates were blown horizontally rather than vertically, as usual for tsunamis.
"It is believed that there was a decline in the sea, a flood of water and caused the tsunami," he said, adding that the force of waves moving along the coast could be concentrated in the north bay.
The representative of the disaster reduction agency Sutopo Purwo's Nugroho's correspondents said that his team was "ready to send easy-to-read public warnings" when the tsunami warning was abruptly withdrawn.
According to the Ministry of Communications, the residents had repeated text messages with warnings, but Nugroho's claimed that due to the earthquake, the lines of electricity and communications were stopped and there were no sirens on the shore.
In the social media, the Indonesians doubted whether BMKG had to withdraw the tsunami warning, and they felt that the information had not been provided in time.
"I'm disappointed... the warning was cancelled... and the tsunamis still happened..." – Twitter user @zanogucci sent a direct message to BMKG.

Only the Americans Larry's Nelson and Lanny's Wadkins were able to do this in 1979.
The alarming results – 3:1, 5:4, 4:3 and 5:4 – show nothing.
Three times the couple won 14 important titles for Woods and twice won over Patrick Reed.
They also sought victory against Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas – this week's US team won three more matches.
Molinaris and Fleetwood will have the opportunity to become the first Europeans to win five points in the weekly competitions.
Fleetwood has already won mainly points in the Ryder Cups competitions as a new European.
The couple, who will be given a lot of new diseases by Mollywood, did not appear to be able to lead the European team forward from the first look.
From Ryder's cup of innovations, such as Fleetwood, is not expected to be such an appearance, and Molinaris won none of the previous six matches and left for the contestants in four.
However, there was hope: Fleetwood was the first in Europe last year, known as Le Golf National Square as its five fingers and won the French Open tournament here in 2017 and demonstrated a strong temper during this year's U.S. Open.
Molinaris is a new British Open champion, and many are considered the most consistent player in the European tournament – this is a useful feature on the ground floor, where high grass can lead to loss, as American failure has shown.
These players' features and harmonious play on the platform made them ineffective.
"Now I feel a little sensitive, but only Saturday," said the cheerleader Fleetwood, all weekend playing with a wide smile.
This afternoon we showed great, played stable and good.
If we mark it together in history, it will be a special achievement.
I'm just glad we made it to the team."
The Molinians were happy too.
"It was great to play with Tommy," he said.
"But we must fulfil our duty, not just to access the records, so tomorrow we will have to fight hard for the 4.5 point we need to win; it will not be easy."
Ritter's hot!
Irish village in the middle of the war
The castle of Claregalway in the West of Ireland was once powerful, the main fortress of the 15-year-old family from England and this Saturday was remembered for its origin.
Riterios doubles his sword during the Middle Ages War Festival in Claregalway Castle in Golf, Ireland, on 29 September 2018.
A completely restored anglonorman house with a box has been turned into a medieval battlefield, where many enthusiasts from all corners of the world to details have restored contact fights and games that were popular centuries ago.
As a result, Karl Dornan and Donna Dornan are patrolling Claregalway's castle in the great art during the Middle Ages War Festival in Golf, Ireland, on 29 September 2018.
"It's a great weekend walk and something's unusual," said Denise Fitzgerald of Keri's funeral, "and he's been a martyr's mistress for the weekend.
"That is how we returned to the simplest things.
I'm trying to do everything the right way," said the theatre worker, for the first time participating in the war festival.
In the field there were genuinely defensed fighters, and although their swords were a book, some of the straws were glued, and one injured the mouth.
The riders demonstrated their skill by driving and cutting their hats and brawls across the side.
On the side of the metal slabs were the weapons of war, and the handcuffs were prepared, and the handcuffs and the wool were dyed.
The participants, who were very gifted and very impressed, tried to get involved.
"I think anyone can wear a costume, but the feeling of being a role is art," said Helena Stackpoole, who played Lady Eleanor Fitzgerald and had the unique opportunity to use her fashion design knowledge.
“All costumes are handmade.
I've been wearing my belt for two years, and now I'm wearing a dress, and I'm only wearing 800 beads on her hands alone.
It matters to me," she said.

The FBI referred to the second woman accused of Kavanaugh
FTB agents investigating the U.S. Supreme Court of Bretto Kavanaugh’s case referred to the second woman accused of sexual assault, which was revealed by this woman’s lawyer on Sunday.
The report by Advocate John Clune of Deborah Ramirez states that the investigation of the FTB's case will not only cover separate charges in an attempt to address which Dr. Christine'a Blasey Ford presented this week to the judge of the Federal Court of Appeal at a dramatic Senate meeting.
Ramirez blames Kavanaugh for showing her his fifth in the evening, where he was drunk and who was in the college of Jelio University when they both studied there.
U.S. President Donald Trumpas gave the impression of the sincere Republicans of the Senate and instructed the FTB to conduct an investigation after a Thursday Senate meeting, where Professor Ford of the University of California filed detailed allegations that Kavanaugh was trying to overthrow her in the evening in 1982 when they both attended school and were teenagers.
NBC News reported on Saturday that the White House limited the scope of the FTB investigation.
A short time later, he denied and announced the message "Twitter" saying, "I really want them to question all the people they need in their opinion."
The representative of the White House, King Shahs, said that the Senate had determined the extent and duration of the FTB study (the study should be completed weekly).
"The White House allows agents to do what they are taught," Shahas said.
United Kingdom will not withdraw environmental or animal protection standards after Brexito
Minister of Environment Michael Gove said on Sunday that the United Kingdom would not meet environmental or animal protection standards so that after Brexito it could enter into trade transactions.
The Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs of Britain, Michael Gove, arrives at Downing Street in London on 24 September 2018.
Speaking at the annual Conservatories' Conference, Gove said that the United Kingdom would benefit from being aware of its quality food products and the government will publish this year's food strategy.
Europe has returned the Ryder Cup in unit competitions
Francesco's Molinaris won the award on Sunday by returning the Ryder Cup to Europe: italian defeated Phil Mickelson at 16 and earned a score of 14.5.
Mickelson gave up his first ball in the water, and Molinaris was able to stay in the parking lot as the first European, and I won all five cats a week, although he did not win one of the previous six.
The European victory has already been ensured that Italy launched the strike from the start-up and the ground win is missing one point, while Henrik Stenson and Sergio Garcia took the lead and was at least half a point certain.
At the beginning of the day they led the result 10:6 and had to earn four and a half points of potential 12, in order to be able to return the trophies and secure their stay in the home, which has lasted since 1993.
Before that, the team only managed to eliminate the difference between four points and win the unit contests: this was done by the US team in 1999 in Brooklyn and Europe in 2012 in the "Medino miracle" competitions, but no one believed in another stunning return.
Justin Thomas, Webbs Simpson and Tony Finau gave Jim Fury's team hope to win the first matches, but then the European team points went all over the site.
Thorbjornas Olesenas devastated Jordan Spieth, and his team's new friend John Rahmas – Tiger Woods: 14 important titled athletes lost four out of four.
The best-known player in the Ryder Cup was Ian Poulter, who waited for the best, mostly ovation this week, when the world's best player Dustin Johnson left him on the 18th riding platform and brought Europe closer to victory.
Then we had to wait for the mother to finish the first, and it was the Molinary game, caused by the joy wave in the mini, which was the greatest event in history.
RT World News: German policemen protecting Erdogan used the neo-Nazi name as a code word
According to local media, secret officials in eastern Germany, Turkey's President Erdogan, who was protected this week during his visit to Berlin, used the name of a sad-fledged neo-Nazi extremist.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the region stated that the criminal police in East Germany in Saxony are investigating two members of the elite anti-terrorist camp.
Men were meant to protect Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during his long-term trip to Germany.
Officials had to work in secret, so the protocol required the use of a code name.
They chose Uwe Boehnhardt, a sadly proud neo-Nazi belonging to a group of extremists of the National Socialists (NSU), who at the beginning of this century killed eight immigrants from Turkey, one Greek citizen and a German police officer.
The local media reported that a different code name was known when two police officers asked for permission to obtain the internal documents necessary to carry out the task.
The officers in charge immediately withdrew the police.
The first commander of the Saxon criminal police, Petrica Kleine, responded to the news.
He said that the decision to use Boehnhardt's name was "beyond being the most foolish" and thus "probably ignored victims and their relatives".
Mr. Roland Walleris, Minister for Home Affairs of Saxony, accepted this statement and called the decision "a cowardly, fearful and totally unacceptable".
Erdogan’s Friday visit to Berlin led to many conflicting assessments in Germany.
The Chancellor, Angela Merkel, was criticized for accepting the leader who was accused of growing authoritarianism.
Merkel said that this visit is very important, "in the event of disagreements, they need to be resolved in person".
The public first heard about the NSU in 2011, when the bodies of Boehnhardt and his partner, Uwes Mundlos, were found in an apartment in eastern Germany.
One of them is believed to have killed another and then killed the bank in Eizenach after a failed attempt to kill the bank.
The third member of the neo-Nazi group was soon arrested, the last live Beate'a Zschaepe.
In July of this year, the German court sentenced her to death for 10 counts.
She refused to contribute to the murder, but her lawyer claimed that the accused felt moral guilt because he did not try to stop the murderers.
Following the NSU scandal, the German security agencies were subjected to a lot of criticism.
Lawmakers, activists and victims believe that the group had much more partners.
It has also been shown that the German Internal Intelligence Agency BfV has infiltrated many informants into the NSU and has constantly hindered the investigation of the group's murders, attempts to kill and rape.
Muskas withdraws from the responsibilities of the head of Tesla and will have to pay $20 million fines to the Securities and Exchange Commission
Elonas Muskas agreed with the US Securities and Stock Exchange Commission, giving it to the court on the fraud of Twitter news, in which he claimed to be making Tesla a private company.
Muskos will have to resign from his post, but the Director-General will remain.
The documents of the Agreement indicate that Muskas must be removed from the office of President of the Council of Tesla within 45 days and shall be prohibited from returning to this office for three years.
In addition, he will have to pay $20 million.
It all started with a message from Twitter, which was either out of the blue or written error, so Muskas will have to get confirmation in advance by saying something about Tesla in any format, including, but not limited to, social media records (e.g. Twitter), company website (e.g. company website), press releases and calls to investors.
Tesla will have to pay another $20 million, because it didn't match Musko's original Twitter message.
On 7 August, Muska was accused of misleading investors in Twitter, where he claimed to have obtained funds to make Tesla a private company, one of which was worth $420 – therefore the company's securities amounted to more than 10 per cent.
Muska quickly withdrew his words by saying that Tesla would remain public and robbed investors.
The Securities and Exchange Commission decided that Musko's initial statement "was incorrect and misleading because it did not accept the facts".
Muskas himself explained that this error could be justified: after meeting with the independent asset fund in Saudi Arabia, he felt that he had been able to agree on the funds.
It is reported that Musku and the Securities and Exchange Commission have drawn closer to the lower penalty – Musku should have refused the President's position for only two years and should not be guilty, but Muskas has refused this agreement on Thursday.
On Friday, the price of Tesla's securities fell and was likely to change its opinion again and agreed with more stringent conditions.
However, under the new agreement, as under the old one, Musku does not have to admit the blame for the error of investors.
The Alexandrian Patriarch undertook to support the canonical Church of Ukraine and called for Orthodox unification
The Patriarch Theodor II of Alexandria stated on the basis of the canonical Orthodox Church of Ukraine belonging to the Patriarchate of Moscow.
He spoke in response to the separation of the Russian Orthodox Church and Constantinople Patriarchate.
On Thursday, Teodor II arrived in the city of Odessa in southern Ukraine and met with the highest church representatives and trusted orthodox.
The Patriarch of Alexandria is one of the most respected Orthodox hierarchies, leading only to the ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.
"I am coming to tell you: do not give up Orthodox faith and canonical church," said Patriarch Theodor II.
Prior to his visit to Odessa, he met with the mayor of the Polish Orthodox Church of Savva, who also supports the canonical Church of Ukraine.
They also called for the prevention of conflicts arising from attempts to justify the autonomy of the Ukrainian Church.
"We will always support those who seek Orthodox unity," said Theodore II.
The Orthodox Church has recently survived a major crisis following the decision of Constantinople Patriarchate to recognise the independence of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine.
The latter belongs to the Orthodox Church of Russia, also known as the Patriarchate of Moscow.
Constantinople decided to send exarches to Kiev, thus violating the rule prohibiting one Orthodox church from interfering with other matters.
The Egyptians are special patriarchal representatives who formally occupy a position higher than the Metropolitan Onufry, who is the current head of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine belonging to the Patriarchate of Moscow.
The Moscow Patriarchate has been misdirected by the actions of Constantinople and has rejected all the common church temples and members of the organizations led or co-chaired by the representatives of Constantinople.
However, it is claimed that this decision warned Constantinople not to take other opposing actions and that the two churches were not considered to have completely terminated the ties.
Of the three churches in Ukraine, only one church of the Orthodox Church belonging to the Patriarchate of Moscow is recognized.
Most Ukrainian clergy recognize its authority, but the government has always openly supported one of the separate churches – the Orthodox Church belonging to the Patriarchate of Kiev, which originated in the 10th century.
This religious movement even has a patriarchal leader, Philaret, to recognize the Orthodox Church, complete independence and equality with the Patriarchate of Moscow.
Damascus opened the main trade transition in Syria-Jordan for the first time in three years
According to the SANA State News Agency, the Syrian Government has claimed to open a border crossing between Nasiba and Jordan, which was closed for three years for war action in this territory.
This can be done because the fighters on the Syrian side left the land to Daraa.
Najibs are the most important trade link not only between neighbouring countries, but also between the Gulf of Lebanon and Persia.
Most important thoughts from the United Nations language
While attending the UN Foreign Minister of Russia, Sergey Lavrovas attacked the West on the "political blackmail and brutal force" and said that diplomacy should not be given to dictatorship and unilateral sanctions.
At the UN General Assembly on Friday, the Minister said that some Western countries, trying to maintain "the positions of the world's leaders themselves", put pressure on others without conscience.
He did not mention specific countries, but said they use "political blackmail, economic pressure and brutal force".
The world must pay a high price for the selfish ambitions of the small group of countries.
Lavrov, representing Russia for the United Nations for the decade, said at the meeting that the culture of diplomacy and negotiations changes the dictatorship and unilateral sanctions applied without the approval of the UN.
The Minister stated that the sanctions applicable to many countries were "unlawful or ineffective" and recalled the embargo imposed on Cuba over many years.
"But history has not learned anything from us," Lavrov said, adding that "the Westerners are only willing to bear the blame if it is "very likely".
We remember how often such unwarranted accusations were justified by interference and wars, such as explosions in Yugoslavia in 1999, invasion of Iraq in 2003 and interference of Libya in 2011."
Of course, Lavrov did not mention all the Western invasions and recalled the seven-year Syrian war as one of the most recent cases.
A failed attempt by extremists to overthrow the Damascus regime could have been fatal to the whole country and opened up opportunities to create a "terrorist calibate".
Lavrova praised the Astana peace process, which began with Russia, Turkey and Iran, and claimed that this process helped prevent the Islamic State (ISI) (formerly ISIS) and other groups who wanted to capture Syria as a whole.
It is now most important to rebuild the country's places of war and help refugees return safely to their homes.
Lavrov returned to the battle of great forces and said that the UN was actually created "to learn from the Second World War".
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia recalled that in 2018, 80 years from 1938, the "glorious" Munich Treaty, which France and the United Kingdom agreed to allow the nations to join the German-occupied part of Czechoslovakia in order to order Hitler.
Although then British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain said the Munich Treaty "will bring peace to these times", the war began a year later.
"Munchen's betrayal" shows how far "the country's selfishness and lack of international law can lead," Lavrov said.
"The dictatorship and the coronation of the colonial era must help the historical archive or the trashyard."
Moscow believes that constructive dialogue can solve all the problems of the world, Lavrov said.
"If you have any questions or questions, sit down and talk, reveal the facts, listen to your colleagues' arguments and try to reconcile interests."
Krislas, do we light the eyes?
RT World News: Israel's nuclear weapons are turning into fog, and Bibi's finger is turning to Iran
The President of Israel, in the speech of the UN General Assembly, claimed that Tehran had secret nuclear weapons.
It may be that the accused Israelite himself is hiding something.
The favorite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has released news on Thursday – he has shown highly photographed photos with places where Iran is likely to consider nuclear material.
Tehran replied without delay that Tel Avivas would rather take care of his "undeclared nuclear weapons programme".
Although Israel never recognized (but did not deny) nuclear weapons, RT journalist Muradas Gazdiev tried to find out if Tel Aviv should actually look for a helmet in his eye.
Scottish Government: no complaints about Alexo Salmondo before January
The Scottish Government claimed that no complaints concerning Alexo Salmondo were filed by January this year.
In January, the former prime minister was charged with two charges of sexual harassment, although he strongly denied them.
In March, he was informed of the investigation.
Salmonda, who has resigned from the Scottish national party, will deal with the Scottish government on the basis of the complaint filed against him.
In reply to the claim that one complaint was first examined in 2013, the Scottish Government stressed that no complaints had been filed before January.
A representative of the Scottish government said: “In January, the Scottish government received two complaints about Alexo Salmondo.
We could ignore them or hide them.
The former Deputy Prime Minister did not hear any complaints about Alexo Salmondo and, as we have already said, the Prime Minister first heard about the investigation from Alexo Salmondo in April 2018.
We are convinced of the legality of our processes and we will firmly defend our position.
The Scottish Government will seek as much information as possible in the time available.
However, as we have already mentioned, for legal reasons we cannot comment more on the case of Mr Salmondo at present."
The representative of Alexo Salmondo said: “We are not going to mind anything, because our petition against the permanent secretary is now being discussed at the courtroom and we hope that the decision will be taken soon.
We'll talk in court.
Our aim is to prove that the Scottish government's complaint procedure against Alex is illegal."
Glazgas interrupted by the Dragons result 29:13: "Warriors" played Lee Jones's kick
Glazgas returned the winner's title in the Guinness Pro14 league by winning additional points and winning the Dragons Scottstown Stadium, while coach Dave Rennie's is not blind to satisfaction, but he believes the game could be more accurate.
After the unexpected loss of the Southern Kings team in Port Elizabethe last Saturday, Rennie's highly changed teams asked to try and although she was able to collect the necessary points so that she could remain at the top of the A conference, the windy and rainy air-fighting matches were certainly not flashy.
"I think we had a great fight tonight, played on the right side of the square, and our strategy was good," Rennie said.
“We had to play more precisely and we could take advantage of more opportunities.
The conditions were not favourable.
We have created many opportunities, and we are happy to do so.
You should play more precisely, but 40 or 50 points won today would not have been a good result.
We should've tried.
We won additional points, but we have to try harder next week to play at home with Zebre, and next week with Saracens in Europe."
Although the air was windy, the Glazgo team soon began to earn points, but TMO received all the balls lost by Huwo Jones, including his captured internal transmission of Niko Matawal in the left corner.
Disillusionment did not last long: the left column of Olis Kebble's fourth minute fell in the middle, and Adam Hastings easily received his guess.
Dragons reduced the difference when Arwels Robson was fined, and safe turned the other player immediately after 20 minutes of mark and the guests earned a point.
The match after the rather quiet first side escaped after almost half an hour's notice: Glazgo's attackers consistently attacked the Dragons line, then the judge from South Africa Stuart Berry's 22 minutes fined the guests for being on the side of Hastings.
Warriors went to the cemetery, but lost the ball after a smooth transfer, because a few left side of Matawal could not manage the ball and it was transferred to the left.
The second test took place two minutes after the interval: Hastings broke the Dragons line and wisely handed the ball over to Lee Jones.
The scene was restored to Hastings' position and the result of the matches became 12:6.
The first minute on the second side of the slide was very successful: Alex Dunbar was hit by Lee Jones for the second test, and Hastings helped him.
However, Warriers failed – just four minutes ago they took the ball in the middle of the square and the Dragon Center Adam Warren pushed it through the door, making the points and then taking Josh Lewis after the open game with Robson.
Warriors quickly returned to the leading position and the 54th minute after the fourth test won additional points when Huwas Jones ran right and Hastings failed to pass the ball (it was the third failure of four tests).
Glazgas maintained a comfortable higher position and, after a few minutes, did the fifth test – Dunbaras handed over the ball after the harvest with George Horne, while Hastings earned points.
Kebble's published as the best match player, but Rennie's fought Hastings.
"They obviously stopped us from playing, but we're in the middle of a hole," said the coach.
“He missed a few meters, but he was skilful and still managed to get away with it.
He's in good shape and trusts himself."
"Ayr United" won by Morton 1:5: the five stars "Ayr" interrupted the master's team
Lawrence Shankland and Craig Moore won two rounds, and Declan McDaids added one more and thus helped keep Air on top of the championship table.
"Ayr" drove forward after Shankland's incursion from six yards after Michael Rose's round-up to McDaid.
In the 35th minute of the first test, Charlie's Telfers took the ball from the two-way Robbie Crawford on his own site and sent it down by Air to Ross Doohan.
The players from Grinoko's fourth-minute breeding ground had a chance to move forward when Doohan was beating Gary Oliver, but Michael Tiderser launched a weak penalty, which the user easily caught.
The 74th minute of "Ayr" was the second time the rivals crossed, when the transfer of the replacement Craig McGuffie's long distance was fired in the air and dropped onto the ground was sent to the door of another replacement player Craig Moore.
Moore's transferred the ball to Shankland the same minute that entered 17 this season.
To the fans, Moore went back to his side four from the corner of the square, and McDais sent a flashing ball to the door.
The Alloa and Falkirk matches ended with 0:2: the first victory of young people in the league
"I'm glad, I'm relieved, I'm happy," said Ray McKinnon, after a very demanding first Falkirk victory league and the winning season points.
"Rangers" loaned by the attacker Zakas Rudden (18th century) won after the entry into both bodies and pushed the master's team "Alloa Athletic" to the bottom of the championship and released the club from pressure.
"It was an important game for us," McKinnon acknowledged.
"We probably earned more during the last three competitions, so it was great to make three points in the tense situation.
I'm glad we got the first points.
It would not have made a difference, but it was important for us to win."
In the 26th minute, Rudden sent a ball to Patrick Brook and earned a take from the door line in the middle of the second basement, when Deimantas Petravičius slowly blew the ball over the consumer Neil Parry.
"We wanted to make a firm statement, but it didn't work," acknowledged Mr. Goodwin, head of the Waps.
Hearts Sickness petition for half-final received more than 11,000 signatures
The Hearts disease petition for the Betfred cup half-final schedule was signed by more than 11,000 people.
They are angry at the decision to hold both semi-finals on the same day and at the same stage.
As advised by the Scottish police, SPFL decided last week to hold the Aberdeen–Rangers reconnaissance matches at 12:00 and the Hearts–Celtic – 19:45, as well as the attack of the Jambos and Dons.
The Evening News, together with Aberdeen Evening Express, called for a fair solution for the victims on Saturday.
The so-called Super Saturday decision condemned both Aberdeen and Hearts: both clubs issued statements that criticise the schedule.
On Thursday, a request was published at change.org which requires one of the matches to be moved to another place or date.
A man accused of murdering two women in the village of Kent
Two women, the sixth and the eighth, died in a place of crime.
According to police officials, another man, also crossed the 70-year-old border, is in hospital and is stable.
The 28-year-old living on the same street remains arrested and will be sentenced on Monday for two murders and one plea to kill Medvejau at a court of judges in which he will be involved in video communication.
The police haven't named the victims yet, but they think they knew the suspect.
The neighbors said that they were shocked by such an event in the village that they said they were “silent and friendly”.
At 31st, Sophie Moorey-Brown, Press Association, said: "We lived here for five years and never heard of any bad events – always very quiet and nice to live here."
Royal Archives and Hamilton Music Creators Light World About King George III
After presenting to the Queen a project that opened up a large archive of documents drawn up in the year of the reign of Jurgius III, it was hoped that letters, newspapers and languages would help the public to get to know the kings of thought.
Now these documents will reach another audience – the Royal Archives have decided to cooperate completely with the music of the West.
The academics who wanted to reveal the true face of the king invited the musician "Hamilton" Jurg III, a leading actor in the library of the Windsor House to review the key documents from the time of the Queen's proproprosene management.
Researchers are trying to make old handcuffs available to a wider audience, and therefore a minority of fans will be able to obtain digital documents.
Members of the royal family have already publicly supported the music creation, while the Hercogiens and Hercogiens will watch twice, although Prince Harry’s father is constantly shown on stage.
Michael Jibson, acting as king in the West, said that the documents had to be considered and helped to identify the King, whose image was composed by the audiences by the musician Hamilton, the film "Keralius Jurgius's impreciseness" and the series for children "Student History".
"We fell in love with beautiful letters"
US President Donald Shortas did not create enthusiasm after the attempt to reduce tension with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Unu and on Saturday at his sponsors' meeting, he said that after writing letters, he was "in love".
Mr Shortas and Mr Kimas said that they would pursue the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula, which they discussed at the unprecedented meeting that took place in Singapore this year.
Before moving to a new phase of history after many years of public disagreements, the leaders of the countries changed with threats and insults because North Korea wanted to create a nuclear missile that could reach the US.
“I was as strict as he was.
We always promised," Mr. Shortas said at the meeting in West Virginia.
"And then we fell in love, you know?
In fact, he wrote me beautiful, beautiful letters."
Lekavičius and Panathinaikas entered the Greek cup semifinal
The Athens Panathinaikas in the fourth-final match of the Greek Cup won without any further effort by Luke Lekavičius.
The Athens team went off with the result 76:68 (29:24, 17:15, 15:11, 15:18) defeated the Patre "Prometheus" team.
Lithuania spent 14 minutes in the square, earned 4 routes (2/2 div.), recovered one ball and performed one result transfer and went twice.

Skvernelis kirtis Šimonyta: everything decided by the party "sweet"
Prime Minister Saulis Skvernelis said that there was a lack of democracy in the internal election of conservators, and the party's leadership actually appointed Ingrid Šimonyta as the candidate for presidents.
"The feast of "democracy" has always been strange, gently saying when the party's toast, the top decided and actively supported one candidate.
Probably the second candidate had no chance of winning even theoretically," S. Skvernelis told reporters in the government
"The Conservatives have appointed their candidate, with that and we welcome them," the Prime Minister added.
The Prime Minister of State Greens said that I. Šimonyt should assess the electorate, recalling her work in the Government of Andria Kubile.
Mr Skvernelis is not yet aware of whether he will participate in the presidential elections.
The Lithuanian State and Green Union intends to approve its candidate next year.
The leader of the leaders of the "states" was Ramūnas Karbauski's conservative election called the "unsuccessful experiment" due to the activity of the minority parties.
"First of all, we need to congratulate the experiment, which has not completely succeeded.
There were only 55% of the party's members, and in total only about 20,000 voters.
Knowing what money was needed to be made available to those elections, it is clear that it was not possible," said R. Karbauskis to the news portal delfi.lt.
"I don't think the cost will be the result, because the result is no, the party decided that their candidate would be so good, but who would spend so much money," he added.
During the weekend of the internal elections, 79% of the members of the Conservative Party and their supporters voted in favour of the Simonytė's candidacy.
Lithuanian wages make fun of the Estus: one area can change everything
According to the Baltic Salary Survey survey carried out this year, the remuneration was mainly increased in Estonia.
Lithuania and Latvia have left their neighbours a little behind, written in the company's press release.
"After surveying 850 companies and examining changes in remuneration in the Baltic countries, we see that monthly wages before taxes in Lithuania increased by 81.8% and on average increased 7.7%, and annual pay with additives by 10.5%.
Latvia has given us a small amount of annual pay here, but as in Estonia, a smaller number of employees compared to our country," says Povillas Blusius, representative of the company that organizes the survey, and adds that with such wage growth trends, the overall economic indicators of the country that dictate them should also be taken into account.
In Estonia, wages are rising the fastest
Although the salaries in Latvia and Estonia were lower for part of the workers than in Lithuania, the increase was higher.
In Latvia, the annual wage increased by 71% of the company's employees surveyed and reached 11% more than in our country.
In Estonia this year, earnings rose by 73 per cent and averaged 13 per cent.
Remuneration trends also have a significant impact on the exchange of workers, as the change in employment can gain much higher remuneration than in the previous job.
For those who have not changed jobs and real estate in Lithuania in recent years, annual remuneration has increased by 8.8% - more often than in other Baltic countries.
In neighbouring Latvia, the annual wage increase for such workers was 3.6 per cent.
Estonia remains a leader in the Baltic countries, not only as an average wage for new and long-term workers.
In the absence of changes in jobs or duties, the rate of remuneration was highest: monthly - 6%, annual, including additives - up to 9%.
According to the Remuneration Research Specialist, such trends often depend on, or are combined with, the overall economic indicators of the country: inflation or GDP growth, their forecasts, state monetary policy, prevailing market conditions.
For example, forecasts of a coming economic crisis encourage business to behave more cautiously, less investment.
The dominant and fastest growing sectors of the country, such as information technology, construction, pharmaceuticals, can also generate common statistics and reduce changes.
The biggest tax burden is for Latvians
In relation to wage growth, it is important to take account of the different tax systems in these countries.
In Latvia, employees pay most of the fees, up to 31% or 34%, which may increase to 42.4% for those who earn more.
This is a permanent 24% rate in Lithuania, so with higher wage growth in Latvia, employees can expect a similar or even less sensitive advantage than in Lithuania.
In Estonia, a tax rate similar to 23.6 per cent in Lithuania is applied, so in this country we find the most favourable labour tax in the Baltic countries.
In the field of IT - the most competitive rewards
According to the study, in all the Baltic countries, almost independently of the level of duties, the positions of IT specialists remain among the best paid.
The opposite is the case in retail trade - the market indices in this area are one of the smallest, so employees earn less than the average market income.
Compared with previous years, the most rapid wage for engineering specialists in higher positions, as well as for risk management professionals, has been raised.
Such wage growth did not overlap this year and some IT positions - a large proportion of organisations' information security specialists increased monthly salaries by up to 14 per cent.
Meanwhile, wages in retail trade remained almost unchanged.
However, some companies have successfully carried out reorganisations of remuneration systems, resulting in an annual salary rise of about 2 per cent due to premiums.
According to the remuneration specialists, there is a trend that wage growth dictates the need for the respondents - the demand for system analysts continues to grow in the Baltic States.
Ariana Grande suffers again: the former promises don't follow the joke
After the separation with Ariana Grande, Pete Davidson sheds his pain by creating loopholes about their relationship.
By participating in Saturday Night Live, he chose to laugh about how fast he acts into serious relationships.
The ladies say that the truth, apparently just three weeks ago, Ariana and Pete canceled their vows, which happened just after a few months of knowledge.
Pete's tried to create scenarios that mentioned his unsuccessful relationship, but it's going to happen in the screens a little later.
It turns out that from his former relationship, the humourist rages himself with Ariana.
She'll get hurt and not hurt at heart.
At least that's how TMZ told the foreign news portal hidden sources.
White or red: the dietologist recommends the choice of sugar
Baltasy on the rags?
Which sugars do you want?
During the polling centres, it has been shown that although Lithuanians are still traditionally collecting white sugar, the fact that many peoples of this white death have completely refused the ingredient.
The fact that raw sugar sales are growing does not blind the sales network representatives.
According to the "Maximos" representative, brown sugar is becoming more popular and the people buy it more and more, although the usual white sugar - according to the choice is still more and more.
It also grows and organic sugar sales also grow in specialised organic products stores.
One of the most popular products there is coconut sugar.
The main difference is the price, according to Dietologist Dalios Vaitkevičiūt, and the harmful effects on health may have on both.
"The raw unrefined sugar is three times more expensive, but in terms of health, these sugars have increased them, using their surpluses is harmful to the body," said Dr. Vaitkevičiūtė.
Living without sugar, the dietologist advises to reduce the amount of sugar per day.
This has done - the benefit of the whole body - falls and unwanted kilograms, improvements and health.
If you use sugar less consistently a month, it will be easier to give up everything.
"Each custom we develop is about a month, so after doing such an experiment, let's say it takes a month to drink some product without sugar - coffee or tea, we'll see how positive this will be and I think we can all give up a little effort," said an ideologist.
Doctors claim that the use of white blood sugar is not necessary - the abuse of sweeteners can become causes of obesity, diabetes, cancer and other diseases.
It is therefore worth trying to consume it at least, because it is added to a lot of food, even to food.
Another "Litecable" step: Lipkevich lends another LKL team
The team of the Paneveži Lietkabeli team welcomed Vytien Lipkevičii - the attacker is loaned by the Prienų Skycop team.
At this Betsafe-LKL season, V.Lipkevičius entered 6.4 points in 22 minutes, recovered 2.8 balls, performed 2 successful transfers and scored 8,5 points of utility.
FIBA Champions League for 29 years 198 cm high score statistics reached 3,8 points, 2,5 points scored ball, 1,5 scored transfer and 4,8 useful score during the 21 minute game.
In the near future, Lietkabelis will announce a new purchase that will strengthen its composition.
S. Buškevics joined the coach staff
The chief coach of the Lietkabeli team, Nenado Čanak, became a well-known Lithuanian assistant, Sandis Bushevics.
41th Latvian in 2005-2006 season played Vilnius "Lithuanias in the morning", and in 2014-2017 worked in this club's system as a male coach assistant.
Last season, S. Buškevicas trained Jäkabpils team.
The director of sports, Jonas Vainauskas, invited Stephana Babraska to the headquarters, but he still intends to continue his career as a basketball player.
Vytenis Jasikevičius was also invited, but he was unable to reach agreement on both sides.
The coach staff of S. Buškevicas Lietkabeli will work with Robert Kuncaiči and Algimanta Bruzu.
On Tuesday, Latvia will join Lietkabel and will be at the Cido Arena in FIBA Champions League with Dijon USA, but on the ground we will not develop it yet, as registration was completed 24 hours before the start of the match.
The reduction in biofuel prices is not suitable for all
In order to reduce biofuel prices, more leaves will be handed over in Lithuania in 2019, says the Minister of the Environment.
According to Kęstučio Navicko, this is how you want to "effect" biofuel prices.
"We have a great set of certain types.
It is necessary to balance (...).
The concentration on soft leaves is because this is how we can affect biofuel prices," said Mr. Navickas on Tuesday when he presented the situation on the crossing of forests.
According to Mr. Navicko, this year the price of wood increased by about 20% in Lithuania.
According to the Minister, in the next year, the ground will be drained as much as this year and the eel will be about 80 hectares lower.
According to him, in Lithuania the trees are growing more because of favourable natural conditions.
"It shouldn't be next year," said Mr. Navicks.
Today, 10.2 million ha forests are state-owned, and 800 thousand ha are private.
Fighting food prices - a certain obligation: to encourage buying only in your area
The proposed obligation to buy 50% of food from local producers to reduce the prices of the measures presented by the Ministry of Agriculture is announced by the news portal 15min.lt.
"The law would apply not only to small traders operating in the regions but also to other suppliers of goods and services.
For example, printing services or office goods could also be supplied to the buyer in municipalities by successful local companies," said Minister Virginius Sinkevičius on the portal.
The president of the association of meat processors, Egidias Mockevicius, does not doubt that this provision would discriminate against a part of the businessmen, and it would be difficult to check whether the law is not used by the sellers.
The measure of incompatibility is also criticised by the Head of the Business Confederation of the Government of Sutkus.
Macrona calls for Europe to fight against Russia and the United States
French President Emmanuel Macronas called on Tuesday to create a "real European army" to ensure opportunities to protect against Russia and even the United States
E. Macron, calling for the creation of a common force in the European Union since his entry into power, says that Europe needs to reduce its dependence on American military power.
In recent years, he has gained a weighting argument when President Donald of the United States announced that Washington will withdraw from the important Cold War Treaty on Nuclear Powers.
"We need to protect ourselves from China, Russia and even the United States," - E. Macron told the radio "Europe 1".
This is the first interview given to his radio from the post of President of the Labour Force in May 2017.
"What do I see as President Shortas announces that he withdraws from the important disarmament treaty created after the 9th anniversary of the crisis of rockets in Europe, which will be the main victim? - Europe and its security," said the French leader.
The above-mentioned missile crisis has resulted in the escape of a non-strategic nuclear arms development race, during which the United States deployed ballistic missiles in Europe.
This crisis was a major factor in encouraging the United States and the Soviet Union to enter into a Middle East Nuclear Power Treaty (INF) in 1987.
"We will not protect Europeans unless we decide to have a real European army," said E. Macronas in an interview, recorded on Monday evening in Verden in north-eastern France, this week during the 100th anniversary of World War I.
According to E. Macrono, in the situation, "as Russia, which is near our borders, has demonstrated that there is a potential danger... we need a Europe that is better protected by itself and not simply dependent on the United States".
The French leader became the main initiator, pushing for a project to establish the forces of nine European countries that can quickly set up a joint military operation, escape from the war zone or provide assistance in the event of a natural disaster.
The defence ministers of these nine states will meet in Paris on Wednesday for the first time to discuss details of how this force will act.
The European Union has also been committed to raising its defence budget significantly since 2021 and for research and development of new technology by around EUR 13 billion over the past seven years.
The current EU defence budget does not amount to EUR 600 million.
However, French military schools preparing high-ranking soldiers, Professor Bruno Alomaras said that the vision of E. Macrono on the closely united defence of Europe is a difficult implementation.
"The idea of creating a common strategy culture is not bad, - he told the news agency AFP.
- However, there is a great gap between the European defence, which Emmanuel Macron has dreamed of, and the facts are very big disagreements between the European partners."
Lukashenko NATO hits rockets: we're not idiots
On Tuesday, the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, stated that his country would need a new weapon if NATO continued to join forces at the Western border of Belarus.
"If NATO continues to be alarmed by the deployment of bases in Poland or otherwise, Belarus will need more effective weapons, in particular missiles," the State News Agency BelTA quoted a group of American analysts from Minsk.
The Head of State also noted that Belarus already has its rocket manufacturing industry.
"In recent years - you have noticed, but we are not hiding - we have created our rocket industry and we have produced our very precise (approved) rocket weapons," the President stressed.
Last week, Mr Lukashenko stated that Minsk and Moscow were looking for an adequate and costly response to plans to build a base in Poland and to name it President Donald Trump (Donaldo Trampo) for the "Trumpo Fort" (Fort Trump).
"Of course, this is a concern for us.
If, let us say, in Poland they will say that they are willing to spend millions of dollars in order to displace (...) some small fort, of course, we are not idiots and, of course, we are reacting to it," said Mr Lukeschenka, participating in the discussions of the main group of the Munich Security Conference.
"It is understandable that we are discussing with our main Union (Russia) how to respond to all of this and how to find a corresponding response at minimum costs," he added.
Western relations with Moscow have been very important due to the annexation of Crimea carried out by Russia in 2014.
Their links also obscure the role of Moscow in the Syrian conflict and this year's battle in Britain, as Russia's special services are believed to have attempted to defeat the former agent Sergei Scripla's nerve paralyzing substance.
The tension between Moscow and Washington further exacerbated the fall of D. Trump when he announced that he was planning to withdraw from the Cold War Treaty on the regulation of nuclear weapons.
Russia warned that this move could undermine the global security system.
The man who executed the strike revealed how his wife was killed by a drunk footballer
Brazil committed a bloody crime in which Daniel Correa Freitas, the footballer of the country, was executed severely.
The athlete was killed at the 18th-year-old girl's birthday party.
A 24-year-old footballer found himself dead in Paranos, south of Brazil.
It is announced that it has been executed: cut-off genitalia, severe neck injuries are reported.
After killing a footballer in 38 years, Edison Brittas Junior admitted his guilt and claimed that he did so because D.C.Freitas had abused his wife, Cristian Brittes.
Later, when Brazil was killed in the death of a murderer, he told us in detail what happened on the night of his death.
"The party has already gained speed, when I realized that for a long time I had never seen my wife's Christian.
I went to our bedroom, but the door was locked.
I broke down the door and saw Daniel and my wife, who were praying for help, lying in bed.
I've been killed.
Together with my former friends in the evening, we pushed him into the field and drove him into the car.
This is where I had a knife, with which I killed my wife, a man who had been robbed.
I was very angry, I couldn't do anything about it," the killer said.
Together with his friends, he threw the dead footballer's body off the river, where police officers were looking for a major crime weapon.
The Brazilian civil police arrested E.B.J., as well as his wife and the holy daughter on the birthday.
It is said that police officers investigating the incident are still hard to prove that women were abused during the evening.
True, the latest news from the footballer has recently been distributed and the photos at the WahtsApp can help you run the investigation.
The footballer sent two pictures of one of his friends through "WhatsApp" in which he spent his life in bed next to a sleeping woman who, as it turned out, was a murderer's wife Christiana.
"I can sleep here.
There are many women sleeping in different rooms.
I'm going to eat the baby's mother, although her father is somewhere nearby," the footballer wrote to his friend.
Daniel Correa Freitas, a member of the São Paulo Club, was selected in the second season under the capacity of São Bento in the Brazilian league.

Can no longer take advantage of the Hurts label for suspension
After this Saturday, the reserved winner, Jalen Hurts, will no longer be suspended for this season.
Hurts has been included in the highest ranking of Crimson Tide on Saturday against the weaker Louisian team and this is the fifth player's match this season.
The NSAA has applied a new rule this year – it is possible to suspend the player who participated in the four matches.
This month, Athletic reported that Hurts planned to do this because of the contradictions, the team's staff responded to the evaluations and the team's training staff.
At the beginning of the season there was a change in Hurts, but "Crimson Tide" coach Nick Sabana said he was still planning to use Hurts' skills.
Last season Hurts helped Alabama get to the matches for the national champion's title against the Georgian team, but the second half replaced Tagovalioa, which contributed to the Crimson Tide's victory at 26:23.
The former President of the South East Conference, Hurts, started the last 28 Ablama cats and entered the season with a record result – 26:2.
In Saturday's competitions Hurts ended the first four "Crimson Tide" episodes 22 out of 31 transmissions, ran 276 yards, earned four points and took over the ball once.
He also ran with the ball 15 times and ran 54 yards.
Owens: Ten must sign the contract immediately
The former commander of Dallas Cowboys, Dezas Bryantas, said shortly after returning to NFL.
A member of the museum of glory, Terrell Owens, said that Bryant was worthy of immediate attention.
In response to a question posed on Twitter when it was intended to sign a contract with the team, Bryanta announced on Friday a message of one word "Twitter": "Nearly."
Three times selected for Pro Bowl matches Bryantas does not belong to any team since, in mid-April, Dalas Cowboys refused to raise a competition for remuneration.
Bryant, who may have refused a contract with Baltimore Ravens and is constantly linked to Kliveland Browns, said before the season that he wants to improve before signing a contract with the team.
In August, when Owens arrived at a professional U.S. football museum, still talking about the return to NFL, the TMZ site said Bryantas should try to get back to sport as soon as possible.
"He must join the team and prove to everyone what he can," Owens told the website.
“All the observers believe that he is no longer well off and that he is no longer as good as he thinks he is.
Now he has to go to the team for any remuneration, accept a one- or two-year contract – it is absolutely irrelevant – and show everyone what he can."
In 2017, Bryanta received the ball 69 times, running 838 yards and six times earned points.
In 29 years, the player won the longest in his career – 23 matches – did not win 100 yards.
After signing a $70 million worth of value contract for five years in 2015, Bryanta has not won 1000 yards in one season and has not received more than eight points of winning balls.
"If the Director-General or the owner is aware that your skills are failing, you will not be able to secure or collect the desired amounts," Owens advised.
He also warned that Bryanta had to get to the team as soon as possible, because later this could generally fail and claimed that it would be possible to return to the heavy-duty Cowboys.
"Of course, I don't know if their relationship isn't damaged," Owens said, who won the three seasons in the Dallas team 38 times.
"I believe that in the case of Dezo, if Cowboys take it back and he gets the opportunity, it will be useful for Dezu and Francis."
Arrangement for the establishment of CERN Business Development Centre in Lithuania
In Kaunas last week, representatives of the European Nuclear Research Organisation (CERN), European Organization for Nuclear Research, were looking at the possibility of establishing a CERN Business Development Centre in Lithuania.
Today, there are ten business incubators in Europe in which companies receive help in commercialising CERN technologies, developing innovative products and adapting them to the needs of the public.
Although Lithuania only became a member of CERN last year, the establishment of a business incubator in the country was already under way.
CERN representatives visited Lithuanian University of Health Sciences (LSMU) and Kaunas University of Technology (KTU) Institutes of Material Science and Biomedical Engineering in the Santakas Valley.
At the National Innovation and Business Centre (NIVC), guests together with KTU, LSMU, Vytautas Grand University, Lithuanian Institute of Energy, Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, Ministry of Agriculture and Business discussed the ecosystem of Kaunas innovations and opportunities for young, innovative businesses.
The CERN delegation's visit is very important because if the CERN Business Development Centre is established in Lithuania, it will be the only one in Central and Eastern Europe and will have a major impact on the region's science and business innovators.
"This incubator would encourage the adaptation of CERN knowledge and technologies to key issues such as new technology and artificial intelligence would be used for diagnosis and treatment, for the processing of large data," says Dr. Leona Balashevich, the professor of science and innovation of KTU.
CERN incubators, as well as other new business development centres, provide support for business development - provide information and expert advice to adapt technology to product development and assist in the search for funding sources.
The difference is that the CERN incubator is more scientific.
This centre includes experts from various fields in Lithuania: information technology, materials engineering, as well as specialists in the medical field.
The organization CERN is best known for the largest hadron anti-fighting speeder (LHC), the largest and most powerful particle in the world.
However, CERN is performed not only in quantitative mechanics but also in other areas, from cryogenics (very cold temperature effects) to particulate monitoring and radiation studies.
The work of these technologies and scientists has an impact on many areas of public importance: medicine, security and industrial development.
"Vilniaus burntė" has a new guide
The new Director General of AB "Vilniaus burntė" appointed Roka Mituza, who will replace Raymond Pilčka in these duties.
As of last summer, P. Pilka will continue to be the financial director of Vilnius Fuels, as stated in the report published by the Vilnius Stock Exchange.
Mr. Mituza is the co-founder of Buga LT, a leading producer, and is listed in his LinkedIn account.
In 2012-2017, Mituzas served as the director of the region's group "SPI Group", previously worked in the "Reckitt Bankiser" and "Unilever" groups.
"Vilniaus burntė" ended in the first quarter of this year with a loss of 315,500 euros.
Last year the company earned 392,300 Euros during the relevant period.
The company’s sales income without excise amounted to EUR 4,956 million and decreased by 13,16% compared to the first quarter of last year.
"Vilniaus burns" employs more than 100 people.
STT detained R. Ača - Business knowledge
The former MP and the former director of the administration of the Raseiń district municipality of Remigius Aza are suspected of messy.
He's been detained.
The Special Investigation Service (STT) shall report that the officials of the Šiauliai Board are carrying out a pre-trial investigation into possible corruption in the municipality of the Rasei district.
"The former director of the administration of the Raseių district municipality of R. A. (Remigius Azas - red.) is suspected of being aquifer.
The circumstances of the non-transparent public procurement, R. A., in the course of the duties of the City Director, are examined - the possibility of an exclusive advantage for a private company to enter into a public procurement contract with a company managed by the Municipality of the Rasei district.
It is suspected that R. A. has accepted a high-value (more than 250 MGL) basket for this," says the STT press release.
BNS adds that that company is the "Rassian Bus Park".
On Monday, officials also arrested the alleged head of the company "Rasian Bus Park" of the municipality of Rasei.
This was confirmed by the STT representative for the press Renata Enskovytė.
The STT report states that the suspicions are also expressed to two representatives of companies who directly bribed Mr. Ač or participated in masking the spoils of various financial operations.
All suspects are detained, their jobs and the crews carried out at home.
Suspended the LSDD
After Remigius Aida had been the director of the administration of the Rasei district municipality for a time, but he lost these duties in April after his report had been rejected by the Council.
He was also the mayor of this region in 2011-2012. Mr. Ajas - a long-term member of the Seimas, he has been elected to parliament since 2004 as the candidate for the "Turkey and Justice" party.
However, in 2013 he and these parties were separated, and in 2016 the Seimas elections did not have an independent mandate.
Now, Mr. Ages depends on the separate Social Democrats and the newly created Working Party of the Socialists of Lithuania (LSDD) led by Gedimin Church.
Shortly after this announcement, the president of the LSDD informed the press in a press release that he temporarily suspended membership in the party until the investigation was under way.
"The actions of the Special Investigation Service and the suspicions expressed to Remigius Achu are an unfortunate surprise to us, but in any case, law enforcement must take all the necessary steps to find out the truth.
R. Time has temporarily suspended membership in the party until a pre-trial investigation is under way," says LSDD leader Kirkils.
In 2003, Ajad was the leader of the group of consultants, then President Roland Pakso, who was later removed from office, the National Security Advisor.
Meras A. Gricius: I did not directly control the work of R. Acho
Neither the mayor of the Raseių district Algirdas Gricius nor the current head of the municipal administration, Liudas Kavaliauskas BNS, said on Monday that they did not have any information on the specific purchase of the law enforcement investigation.
Meras Gricius said about Mr. Acho's detention after having heard from the media.
"I can't really say that we were very inclined by the functions, I've worked as a mayor, he (R. Acas - BNS) is an administrative work, and I couldn't say anything for any reason, or for any public procurement, this was done," BNS said on Monday.
He also argued that for the same reasons he would not want to assess the administration of the former administration of the municipality of Acho.
I was afraid to say something that I could evaluate his activities, because I did not directly control his administrative work, as I was presented to me about public procurement, about the tenders, said that such and such public procurements, such tenders, after what was seen in the public space, were concluded, which I had already seen as a mercenary.
I cannot therefore state how he led the administration at the time as its director," said Mr Gricius.
He himself said to public procurement without interference.

S. Gentvilas: 90 million Euros are at risk for the non-implemented business of GPAIS
The vice-president of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee, Simon Gentvilas, said that, due to the poor functioning of products, packaging and waste accounting information system (GPAIS), Lithuanian producers and importers may have to pay almost 90 million euros at the end of the year.
"As the end of the year is nearing and the GPAIS system has not started to function properly, the systemic crisis in the packaging sector is becoming more and more real.
Unofficially, it is stated that only 1% of the planned recycling tasks have been issued with certificates confirming the handling of packaging waste," said Mr Gentvilas in the press release.
On 7 November, Seimun launches an extraordinary meeting of the Environment Committee to discuss the situation, to find out why the functions of this programme are not affected, why the programme module is not actually implemented, and how the Ministry of the Environment intends to address the problem.
"Without the necessary legislative or legislative initiatives, producers and importers are at risk and are again receiving huge environmental pollution taxes at the end of this year," says Gentvilas.
In his view, the shortcomings and inefficiency of the GPAIS accounting system signal a serious crisis in the packaging waste sector, which can be compared to the Metrail crisis.
Disappointment of tasks
Some experts warn that part of the companies may not be affected by the waste recycling tasks imposed by the State in 2018.
In the light of the indicators published by organisations for the first half of the year, the experts state that they see the basis for concern that some organisations may fail to manage the required quantity of packaging waste in 2018.
As a result, part of the companies may no longer be able to benefit from the reduction in the pollution tax and would be able to pay the pollution tax for certain quantities of packages released on the market per year.
The GOC stated that two out of three producers’ organisations currently operating were rejected and one did not comment.
Kėstutis Pocius, CEO of the General Green Point, said that at least formally it would be possible to meet the tasks depends on whether the problems of the product, packaging and waste information accounting system (GPAIS) will be solved.
"Green Point" plans that this year will be able to overcome all types of packaging management tasks, except for glass.
Although the green point of the glass task will not succeed in this year, the organisation promises to compensate members for the losses resulting from this.
Experts doubt the benefits of food coupons
In planning for the government to share food coupons for the less-favoured people and thus promote the business of family or farmers, experts doubt the benefits of such innovation.
They agree that a new system would create an additional bureaucratic burden.
The head of the Lithuanian Business Confederation Tax Commission, Marius Dubnikov, says that coupons have survived and no problem has been solved, and the Government should focus on increasing human income.
"The system seems quite strange and is taken from the old leaders.
If we want to help the public buy something or have more purchasing power, we have to focus all our capacities on how to increase people's income, and people themselves have to decide whether to buy in one store or another," said BNS Dr. Dubnik.
According to him, the government would use less income for people who receive food when offering food coupons.
"It seems to apply to the less-income people, as if they were on the floor with a pencil on which it would be written, well, we, this Government, have given you a bowl, and be kind to us.
It sounds like some kind of anti-choice promises, where you want to write your signature very clearly to them," said the analyst.
According to him, the food coupon system will need additional investment, and it will increase the administrative burden, as it will need to monitor who and how they are protected from working.
The Bank's chief economist, Nerijus Mačiulis, says that with one instrument to achieve both objectives - to support low-income residents and small entrepreneurs - would not succeed.
"If this is a support for small businessmen, the aid for laundry compensates price differences and the population can buy cheaper goods in smaller shops, this compensates the price difference from the budget.
Then this is support for business, but not support for the population," BNS said Mr. Mačiulis.
In his view, such a system would probably not have a significant macroeconomic impact and would not have substantially changed the competitive position of small retailers, rather than creating additional bureaucratic burden and could make it difficult for new market participants to arrive.
"It seems that this would be a rather bureaucratic instrument with high administrative costs, and that the people would also be quite uncomfortable, they should buy not in any larger store with a higher range of houses, but search for several specialised stores with a lower range," said the economist.
According to him, coupons are used in other countries where the volume of goods or services is limited and should be given to all equally, or to some social group.
The people then receive coupons free of charge and can be delivered for food.
According to Mr Mačiuli, they are also used in the labour market by granting temporary tax benefits to businesses in the employment of long-term unemployed or, for example, former prisoners.
Such practice, in the words of Mr. Mačiuli, has also been successfully applied in Lithuania.
On Monday, Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis said that a new system of food coupons was being considered by the Government to help the poorest people, to increase competition, to encourage small-scale traders or farmers.
Prime Minister Advisor Skirmantas Malinauskas BNS said on Monday that the idea is most focused on farmers and family businesses, and buyers with coupons could get a 20-30% discount.
According to him, the amount of coupons would be limited so that farmers would not be able to misuse.
According to him, 3-5 coupons would allow a person to benefit 10-15 euros a month.
Although the state budget does not yet provide for funding for the programme, it could be financed from this source, perhaps also from the European Union funds.
"Not everything currently provided for or not foreseen in the budget will be final, yet it will change in the Seem, so happens, the funds may be transferred from one line to another, and from ministries may change funding matters.
There is always a priority to decide whether or not to find another additional source of income and similar," BNS said on Tuesday, Mr Malinauskas.
The extent to which innovation can be applied and from when.
