In China and in the area, two men killed themselves
One of the hangings has already attempted suicide.
On 30 October, about 1-00, in the village of Lugowe, the man of birth committed suicide by hanging in 1947.
It's known that he's been trying suicide before.
What led a man to such a move is not known.
On 31 October, from 11 to 50, he was killed by a 41-year-old man, a Chinese resident.
No evidence of violent death has been found, reports the news media of the Chinese MVD.
You got a black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers are trying to find money for the repair of the exhaust system, many start to see a solution in a small black box that is precisely fitted on your car’s gearbox.
These devices, which track each passenger mile and transmit this information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt to modernize the old-fashioned system for the financing of American highways by Washington and the state planning bodies.
Usually a boring highway planning arena gave rise to intense debates and colorful alliances.
The Liberians have joined environmental groups in lobbying the Government to grant the right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you have traveled, and perhaps even where you travel, and then use this information in the preparation of tax accounts.
It's a chaplain's move in shock.
The American Union for Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and raises a number of issues relating to private life.
Although the Congress is not yet able to agree, continue or not, a few states are not going to wait.
They are thinking about how to move to a system where drivers pay for every mile they travel.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is really necessary for our country.
“This is not the question that we may have the right to choose,” said Hassan Ihrat, Executive Director of the Association of Governments of Southern California, which prepares plans to start monitoring by the authorities of the Mile by each California car by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
There's technology for that.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government's Road Construction Fund, which is financed by the United States' tax system.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
The cars go more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased by 20 years.
Politicians do not want to increase the tax by even one cent at high prices for petrol.
“The fuel tax simply cannot be kept,” said Li Mannic, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
It has recently installed 500 tracking devices to test the wrong pay system.
“This will be the best alternative in the long term,” he said.
It's called a wrong user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, as tax will help to change the nature of travel to reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
The California Planners are looking at the system in developing strategies to achieve the targets set by the ambitious laws of this state in the fight against global warming.
However, a member of the Chamber of Representatives Bill Schuster (Republicer, Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Transport Committee, said that he also considered the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
The Free Market Commitments in the Reasons Fund are also alarming that drivers will be forced to pay for every mile.
“It’s not just a tax that will go into the dark hole,” said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Political Affairs Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
This movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 called for congresses to move towards a wrong pay.
The US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year, involving some 10,000 cars.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected this proposal because of the fears of rural legislators representing voters, who often have to travel a lot of miles in everyday life to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, however, go on their own.
The biggest enthusiasm is shown in the state of Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are attracted to participate in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state for a nice run instead of a gas tax.
The pilot project has already been completed in Nevada.
It is being considered in New York.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport departments of 17 eastern states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is exploring how they can make these changes.
This concept has not been universally recognized.
In Nevada, where about 50 cars of volunteers had recently been equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the Government could follow each step.
“The concern about the “great brother” and such things is a major problem,” said Alaudin Khan, who is responsible for strategy and efficiency management in the state transport department of Nevada.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When tests went full, the United States Office of Civil Liberties in the state of Nevada warned on its website: “It will not be difficult to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices”.
There is no need to create a huge, huge technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to keep records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where poor technology is difficult to find, which would allow the state authorities to take care of the car miles, but without information about the location and time.
If you can do that, Han said the society would feel more at ease.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Originally, this company did not support the collection of state taxes.
It sought to enter the developing market of the type of vehicle in which drivers are paid on the basis of running.
But the devices it tests attract road designers because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information periodically charged with modem.
“People will be more inclined to do this if you don’t track their speed or track their location,” said Ryan Morrison, Executive Director True Mileage.
There were several major errors in some of these state pilot programmes.
There are far less expensive and less demanding ways to do so.
In Oregon, designers experiment with the provision of different options to drivers.
They can choose the device with or without GPS.
Or they can give up the device altogether by deciding to pay a fixed fee on the average number of miles that all the residents of the state travel.
In other places, they hope to sell the idea of a cautious public, forcing the devices to do more, not less.
In New York, transport officials are trying to develop a taxing device that will also be paid on parking counters, provide insurance “payments as you are driving” and collect a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers who could be used by drivers to avoid sampling.
“Automobiles will be attracted to the benefits offered to them,” says the urban design paper.
Some transport system designers, however, wonder if not all of the wrong-paying talks are simply a huge factor.
In the city transport commission on the San Francisco Bay, officials say that the congress could easily overcome the bankruptcy of the Trust Fund for the Construction of Roads by raising taxes on petrol.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be taken from drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of petrol to pay their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgical intervention, when all you have to do is take aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, Director of the Legislative and Public Relations Commission.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their private lives and many other things.
EU prepares Ukraine's support for Russia's economic pressure
The European Union has a gas reserve plan for Ukraine, as well as an emergency credit agreement with IMF if Russia takes any action in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius Summit.
The IMF is negotiating a standby loan, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their goal was to conclude an agreement in the near future.
In addition to the potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the EU itself.
Analysts questioned by Reuters are suspected that Ukraine and IMF can overcome the long-standing differences in funding conditions.
He did not believe in the possibility of reforming the aid required, and the international S&P rating agency, which reduced Ukraine's sovereign rating on Friday to one stage, until "B" with "B".
However, EU representatives say that IMF can show flexibility in terms of credit, taking into account Ukraine's circumstances.
In addition to the EU's financial support plan, the country has a spare option to provide Ukraine with gas, which is a major part of its supply from Russia.
Maybe it's going to be a North Stream gas or a reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way in the event that Russia is “insulating” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reverse deliveries to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks and will probably lead to a reduction in deliveries to other regions.
"The EU-Ukraine countries are negotiating how to create favourable conditions for Ukraine to import gas from other sources rather than from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes," added the Reuters source.
Russia outside the fight against urban car pollution
Attempts to address the transport problems of major cities have been seen in most megapols of the world since the second half of the 20th century.
As a rule, it was either the refurbishment and expansion of the highways or the attempts to reduce the demand for car travel, the number of cars and the time they were used.
Singapore is a well-known example of a strong quota of private car growth and the right to purchase them is purchased in auctions.
His price can be twice as high as the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced a fee to enter the city centre.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, the so-called green zones are introduced, where only vehicles with a certain ecoclass are allowed to enter using high-quality fuels (including biofuels or electric cars).
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, adopted a five-year clean air plan in 2012 at a total cost of approximately 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
As explained by the Director of the Department of Transport Pollution Control of the Municipal Environment Bureau of Beijing Li Kunseng, the main goal of the five-year period is to reduce leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, increase in the number of private cars to a level of not more than 6 million (now 5.2 million) and increase in fuel consumption by no more than 5% per vehicle.
According to the agency, traffic in Beijing is now responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the programme is the limitation of the use of road transport and the introduction of additional taxes for drivers.
In addition, urban “green five-year measures” include an accelerated transition to Euro-fuel standards compared with the rest of the country, the introduction of a local eco-standard system and the marking of cars and fuels, the restriction on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, the prohibition on the use of outdated vehicles (including the establishment of incentive financial programmes to replace old cars with hybrids or electric cars), the development of electricity (including public and public services), the development of public transport (including high-speed).
Beijing's car innovations also include a ban on all private cars operating within the fifth transport ring (all six of them in the PRC) one day a week (the corresponding information is in the vehicle number) and the issue of registration marks for cars based on the lottery (e.g. in 2011, the first lottery year, the total number of registration permits for private cars in Beijing was only one third of the number of 2010).
According to the current 2012-2020 eco-protection programme, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 they were 138).
According to the Ministry of Transport, 41 per cent of all emissions of pollutants into the city atmosphere were reported in 2011.
In Moscow, for example, car emissions are ten times higher than industrial emissions, and in St. Petersburg at nine times.
In the RF, there is only a beginning to think about the possibility of limiting the regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
The Director of the Institute of Transport and Transport Policy of the U.S.A. Michael Blinkin believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road travel - a matter of course unpopular - can be taken by society only if they are more fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem relating to the structure of its car park, where there are two clusteres that are less sensitive to any regulatory effects - both official and personal cars, as well as "privileged" cars, with a total number of at least 200 thousand (about 5% of the total number of Moscow cars).
During the days of the ECOM city centre in St. Petersburg, a study was prepared to analyze the balance of urban areas between the residential structure, the road area and the number of road transport.
The main findings of the researchers: the city centre provides roads twice as much as required, and most motorists living in the city do not use cars every day, leaving them on the parking lot or just on the streets for a long time.
As a result, it is proposed not to build parks, not to expand but to reduce the road section (to make the streets more friendly for pedestrians) and to limit the use and location of personal transport within the area of the security zone of the historic centre (a total area of approximately 3212 ha covering a number of central areas of the city).
The fines for unauthorized street trade in Vwolde will increase once
According to the city authorities, the increase in fines would help to order the Vlogde and free the streets from natural tents and shackles.
Most street merchants do not pay taxes, the product they produce is often not subject to appropriate health control.
And that means that wet health is under threat.
Thus, the lower limit of the fine for unauthorized trade for citizens from November will be six times, from 500 rubles to 3,000 rubles, reports the Vlogda Administration press service.
Goldman Sachs warned about risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks for Russia's main low-income driver - consumption.
This is primarily a non-payment crisis for unsecured consumer loans and massive reductions in workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed down, rather, the structure of that growth.
He has recently been fully responsible for consumption, which is almost free of traffic," said chief economist Goldman Sachs on Russia Clemens Grafe, presenting a quarterly report yesterday on the Russian economy.
Now the nominal wage growth in Russia is about 10%.
If inflation is 6 per cent, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at about the current level, waiting for Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so they are likely to be optimizing staff costs.
Today, we see a significant increase in wages in GDP: if wages grow by 10%, GDP is only by 2%, Mr. Grafe explained.
The companies faced a reduction in profitability.
If it does not grow, it can lead to unemployment and unemployment.
The Russian business cannot raise salaries, says the chief economist Barclays Capital for Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantushiin.
Unemployment close to historical minimums, competition for high workers.
Employers have to raise salaries in order to change or retain current staff.
Russia's demand for support is fueled by very rapid growth in demand.
In Mr. Grafe ' s view, because of the extremely high consumer interest rates, this type of credit does not have a multiplicative effect on the economy.
"The benefits for the economy from growth in demand have not been seen, the money is not spent on the economy, and the same banks are returned as interest payments," the economist said.
But the problem is, in Goldman Sachs, there's a growth in the delay in unsecured loans.
They are taken mainly by the poor who provide for them.
Interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are not returned more often," said Mr. Grafe.
Therefore, the second threat to growth in Russia is a possible non-payment crisis for unsecured loans.
The Director of the Banking Institute of VSE Vasili Solodkov will now see the signs of the emerging banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to cheap resources, such as the hosbanks, were forced to attract high-percentage funds.
In response, the gosbanks went to war and began to lower their credit rates, and the economist continued.
Small credit organizations could not lend loans below the same percentage, otherwise they would have a negative margin.
If gosbanks do not give up dumping, Russia is in danger of a full-fledged banking crisis, according to Vasili Solodkov.
The exclusion of a number of banks in recent weeks is considered by the economist to be the predecessor of a mass collapse.
“The banks themselves will not cope with this situation: the investment insurance system was not initially expected to be a systemic crisis,” warns the head of the institution.
However, consumption growth will slow down without a non-payment crisis, and it will be based on the investment, due to the failure to index salaries for employees and soldiers in the current version of the draft budget.
Part of the impact on consumption will be milded by the freezing of natural monopolies tariffs (and, as a consequence, by lower inflation).
But only in part: if investments do not grow (and the prerequisite for this is not yet available), consumption growth will still slow down, confident in Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantushiin of Barclays Capital has not yet seen a prerequisite for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still a drop in oil prices," he says.
According to him, Russia's economy would begin to fall at a cost of less than $90/barr.
In Goldman Sachs also noted that the CB has not yet been able to reduce interest rates in the economy.
The paradoxical picture is observed: inflation has fallen, and banks have started to raise their rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the CB that announced the transition to inflation,” Clemens Grafe said.
The Central Bank ' s interest policy on market rates does not affect only interbank credit rates.
"For the CB, it's a failure of all hope," appreciated Clemens Graffe.
Banks use money received in CB auctions, not for crediting the economy, but for managing their liquidity
As the rate declines, the exchange rate changes immediately, which means that the funds are trying to go into speculation against the rubble.
"In the early hours or later, the CB will realize that this strategy is not working," said Mr. Grafe and recalled that the State is planning to release the rubble into free navigation by the end of 2015.
But it will either have to do so sooner or raise the key rate of CB (5.5%), he believes.
According to him, the ruby rate is now artificially high by 10 per cent.
Only one road is weak, the expert concludes.
But if the CB is in a financial position, even a shadow of doubt that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of the policy of weakening the rubble, it can destroy the ruble much more.
A second assembly of the peoples of the South Ural took place in Chile.
The Forum is dedicated to the Day of People's Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of the Russian State and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
Delegations from all cities and districts, representatives of national and cultural associations, religious confessions, legislative and executive bodies participated.
The Forum's course is aimed at strengthening international agreement.
We can set an example here not only for other regions but also for other countries.
We don't have differences and differences.
We live in full understanding," says Feofan, the mitropolit Chelabian and Zlatoustowski.
The meeting considered a number of issues, including the education of patriotism, cultural cooperation.
As a result of the convention, the resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theatre.
The exhibition of national and cultural associations in the Chelabian region was opened here.
Snouden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany on the issue of U.S. intelligence
Edward Snowden, U.S. intelligence informant, said he was willing to go to Berlin to give a testimony to the German Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director, Kit Alexander, could not answer questions about their activities.
The German MP Hans Christian Strfhehele met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was given asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter from Mr. Snouden, who presented the media in Berlin on Friday, he said: “Although my efforts were clearly positive, my Government continues to be different as a change and is trying to criminalize political statements by criminal charges that do not provide any protection”.
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snouden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States Government to renounce criminal charges against him.
The accusations brought by the U.S. Ministry of Justice include spying and stealing of public property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Minister of the Interior, told Time Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak to German officials, we will find ways to do this.”
The relationship between the United States and Germany was tense after allegations that the ANB had been listening to the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Opperman, a member who led the parliamentary group on intelligence, said that if there was an opportunity to hear Mr. Snouden as a witness, “no risking his or her relationship with the United States completely”, it should be used.
Mr. Strfhedel, a MP from the Green Germany party, posted his photograph with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strfheil said that, according to the lawyer of the former ANC contractor, Mr. Snouden could not return to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden had given testimony in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be there “in security”, the deputy said.
Mr. Snouden said in his letter that he had faced a “hard and constant” campaign of persecution that had forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that he was thrilled by the global response to “his political statements”.
Citizens around the world, as well as high - ranking officials, including in the United States, have found the uncontrollable system to be useful to society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be solved”.
Frontier Airlines will take the pay for the hand bet
Frontier Airlines plans to take from passengers up to $100 because they carry a handhold on board their journey.
Frontier Airlines plans to start taking up to $100 for a hand bet and $2 for coffee or gas, although their announcement on Wednesday said passengers could leave the whole bank.
The new hand-held fee is distributed to the bags in the upper luggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free of charge.
Frontier said he'd take $25, if the collection was paid in advance, and $100, if the travelers would pay only when they went out on the landing.
Frontier Kate O'Malley said that a $100 salary should make passengers pay early.
"We don't want to pay for it," she said.
The airline began to pay for the first and second baggage bags in 2008.
Passengers who try to avoid these charges are getting as much as they can in a handbag placed in the upper luggage compartments, which often does not contain seats in these sections.
Collections are one way to make passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said that this new collection really wasn't for making money.
The case is that the most loyal Frontier clients claim that finding a place in the top luggage sections is becoming more and more difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline site will not be required to pay.
This means that one passenger in turn at the exit of Frontier can be able to carry the bag free of charge, while the next passenger in turn can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that changing procedures on the website and the frontier registration stock was intended to ensure that passengers would know about the collection before they went to the landing site.
The new Frontier collection for the hand bet will not start before summer, although the date is not yet set.
Passengers often complain about luggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of luggage is worth money, and the passengers who need this service must pay for it.
Many in Wall Street believe that adding luggage charges is a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of aircraft after several years of losses.
Most of them, however, did not pay for the hand bet.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first collection three years ago, and another discount Allegiant Air followed her example.
The only other airline with such a collection is Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant J. Sorensen, who carefully monitors the additional charges.
According to its assessment in the December 2011 report, the collection of the manual bet is $50 million per year.
Sorensen, former top manager Midwest Airlines, recently flew the Spirit flight, and he was interested that he would find himself on the landing when passengers met the unusual collection of Spirit for a hand bet.
"The landing process was the smoothest thing I've ever seen in my career in the airlines," he said.
I was looking forward to seeing a toothbrush and a dragon coming out of the landing.
The plane was flying, he said, "and the landing passed quickly."
Frontier is also required to pay Spirit for $2 for coffee, tea, gas or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who receive gas or juice can leave the whole bank and that the flow of coffee will be provided free of charge.
She will continue to distribute the water free of charge.
US Airways had recently tried to take a drinking fee in 2008, but had refused it seven months later, after the passengers began complaining and no other large airline followed her example.
Frontier's initiative to pay for a hand bet when passengers don't buy tickets directly at the airline is her last step on attracting customers to their website.
Air carriers pay online ticket vendors, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has enabled all airlines to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them rather than to turn to a travel online agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began to give twice as many bonus miles as a frequent passenger to customers who bought tickets through an online tourism agency.
On Wednesday, it cut the premium per mile to 25 per cent of the mile of travel.
So, a 1,000-mile trip from Frontier, purchased from an online tourist agency, would make it 250-mile.
In addition, passengers can choose their location in advance only if they buy tickets directly on Frontier.
Frontier has a loyal client base in her home town of Denver, but her business is decreasing and getting lost.
The profit fell by 9 per cent and the summer opportunities decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published in the middle of the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to correct Frontier's finances in the context of the sale of the airline.
AnB blames “internal error” rather than hackers for stopping the site
The Secretary-General of the National Security Agency stated on Friday evening that the termination of their site caused technical failure for several hours rather than hackers, as stated in the network.
“NSA.gov was not available for several hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during the planning update”, the intelligence agency reported in an official e-mail.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Claims that the decline in work was caused by a distributed "rejection" attack [DDoS] are not true.
Earlier this evening, the online server monitoring system registered that the ANB site was not working for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable for some users.
ABC News reported earlier that the Agency ' s internal secret network was "no" broken.
No confidential information was in danger, the representative said.
At least one online hacker group of activists stated that it was responsible for the removal of the ANB site through the DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks have been developed in such a way that the target site is trafficked until the servers are overloaded and the site is out of line.
The hacker tactics are relatively simple, and attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal target system.
The former super-secret ANB, once known as the Network of such an Agency, has been at the centre of public attention in recent months and has been severely criticized after a series of revelations about its extensive foreign and internal intelligence programmes, all of which have been a response to the secret file of ANB stolen from the agency and published by the former official of AnB Edward Snowden.
The growing debate around the Agency has led to the fact that today's incident was the result of targeted hackers.
Bombardier's income decreases with the drop in deliveries and the number of orders on aircraft
The Bombardier Corporation, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported a 15 per cent reduction in net income on Thursday under the reduced number of orders and delivery of aircraft in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its railway division.
Bombardier, also located in Montreal, has not published any data on its new CSeries flight tests and has not provided any new information on whether ambitious plans to introduce the aircraft into commercial operation will be implemented by next September.
After the first flight of an experienced aircraft, held about half a month ago, he only flew three more times, which raises questions as to whether the time-limit test is in place.
The results did not justify projections and resulted in more than 8 per cent of the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerxen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment on Thursday from “higher” to “medium” because of the belief that the increase in shares is limited in the next quarter or two.
“Despite the downturn in the number of airships, we are, of course, disappointed by the performance of the transport department,” Doerksen said in the fund market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders from CSeries as the flight test programme continues.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we expect the market to be more skeptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will allow it to take a position in the lower price segment of the market where Boeing and Airbus are now dominated.
The first experienced model of the aircraft was presented in March and the first flight took place in September after a few months of delay.
However, the firm orders for CSeries are not too much yet — 177, since potential buyers are waiting for the results of the summer tests to verify the company's allegations of fuel efficiency and the potential economy of the new liner.
There are now 403 orders and arrangements with 15 clients and operators.
Chief Executive Director Pierre Boduan was assured that Bombardier would reach its goal in 300 solid orders by the time the first aircraft was launched in commercial operation.
On Thursday, the leaders also assured analysts and media that the programme was moving forward.
“The aircraft test model did not remain on the ground longer than expected,” Boduan said during the telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the flight.
All manufacturers plan different tests.
We decided to take the first flight and stop updating, so we did.
This will take place throughout the flight test programme.
A second of the five test samples must fly in the next few weeks, and the others will soon follow, as reported by the company.
However, the analysts are skeptically referring to the statement that the first client will be able to start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier stated that it would assess the time of entry into service and provide new information within the next few months.
“This slow rate of summer tests – although it is obvious and consistent with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that the entry into operation will be transferred to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter, ending 30 September, the net income of Bombardier fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, with $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
The adjusted profit for the stock remained at 9 cents earlier.
The gross income has decreased slightly from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected 10 cents of stock and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world reported that he had placed 45 aircraft per quarter, which was less than the previous year — 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The portfolio of the Airspace Division orders amounted to $32.9 billion on 30 September, with no change since 31 December.
“The results in the aerospace area were consistent with our objectives, but a small number of incoming orders and common market conditions became an unacceptable factor,” Boduan said.
The gross aerospace income fell by 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, reported that the gross income in this sector increased by almost 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport department amounted to $32.6 billion on 30 September, which was slightly higher than 31 December.
The transport unit ' s revenues have had a negative impact on the performance of several major contracts.
The Guide stated that a new development plan would be introduced in the fourth quarter.
The shares of Bombardier, which also announced that the principal financial director of Google Patrick Pichett would join the Board of Directors, fell by 8.5 per cent to C$4.83 in the middle of Thursday.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the closest competitor, reported a 10 per cent reduction in quarterly income on Thursday.
Sony expects less annual income
The Japanese electronics producer, Sony Corporation, completed the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the forecast for income for the current financial year.
Sony's results from July to September 2013 were more disturbing than was expected to be related to the fall in demand for television, video cameras and personal computers produced by the Japanese corporation.
Sony's television business, which first brought operating income of 5.2 billion yen in the second quarter of the year, again dropped to 9.3 billion yen in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is experiencing a difficult time, especially due to lower TV demand.
And while competitors are trying to find a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main competitors, Panasonic's corporation, has recently shifted emphasis on industrial components: companies' sales are growing at high speeds, especially through car systems and clean technologies.
As a result of the end of the financial year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion of the operating income against the expected 230 billion of the year before.
According to Thomson Reuters, however, analysts assumed that this figure would be much higher and would amount to 221 billion yen.
To get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding the food line.
In the middle of this month, the sale of smart hours from the Japanese corporation, which has given a number of fashion functions, has been announced, which will allow you to get rid of the need to deliver smartphones 100 times a day.
After Sony reduced the annual income and profit forecast, the company's shares in opening trades in Tokyo lost more than 11 per cent in the morning, down to the level of one share in 1668.
Gen's speech was an incentive for synapses education
Researchers at John Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Medical School discovered a white, which has enabled Foxp2 to perform its function by stimulating the development of new connections between neurons.
The study was published in Science, and its summary was available on the journal website.
Gen Foxp2 is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
Its role was established in 2001 by the discovery of a family of several people who could not speak correctly and sometimes not even understand each other.
Scientists have found that the work of the Foxp2 gene has been violated in the family, but how it performs its function has not been known.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their Foxp2 functions are an incentive for the education of new brain synapses.
He's doing this because of another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was found as a result of the search for factors that stimulate the education of synapses.
SRPX2 has been found to be one of 10 such genes found by the authors, with Foxp2 only focusing on its activity.
The fact that SRPX2 really affects vocalization has been confirmed by scientists in the mouse experiment.
When the genes were artificially reduced in animal activity, they cried less when they were separated from their mother.
If gene activity has been restored, the frequency of the released sounds has also been restored.
Earlier on the mice, there was also a connection to the vocalization of Foxp2 itself.
The animals that introduced a human copy of the gene were more active and less frequent than normal mice.
To date, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and SRPX2 with purely "mechanical" sound education properties or more delicate processes are related to the work of Foxp2.
A cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned the head of the criminal police investigation unit, in prison
42-year-old Basharat Dieta transmitted information to the criminal authority of Nile Scarboro
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed.
He was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment by the Liverpool Royal Court.
A prestigious lawyer who told a drug baron about a major police investigation because he was afraid of disclosing his secret drug addiction was imprisoned for three years.
The 42-year-old Basharat Dieta provided the criminal authority of Nile Scarboro with confidential information on his investigation into illicit drug trafficking after being threatened by cocaine addiction.
A lawyer who received a call from Bas and a criminal “big lawyer” was arrested at home in 2011 after a police operation on the Scarboro case, which he had previously filed in a drug-related court.
The officers noticed that 32-year-old Scarboro left three cocaine packets at the lawyer's house in the town of Blackburn County of Lancashire while it was at the dinner table of lawyers with colleagues.
The follow-up revealed that Dieta was regularly using Class A drugs after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his paper and on credit cards.
During the eight months from January to August 2011, he sought illegal information on the arrests of two persons under the command of Scarboro and one of his associates.
All four suspects were under police surveillance during the extensive investigation of the criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lankashire, Cambria, Mercisiade, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later in prison after the police had removed £1.5 million in a series of heroin and cocaine raids as well as more than £200 thousand in cash.
The 42-year-old Child transmitted information to criminals because of the fear that his cocaine addiction would be exposed.
Today, at the Liverpool Royal Court of Diet, which works in the legal company Forbes Solicitors, located in Blackburn, has been visited by the Crown after his confession of his guilt in two cases of intentional obstruction of justice following a three-week trial in the Liverpool Court of Crown.
He admitted to holding cocaine at one of the previous court meetings.
The lawyer's disclosure took place after the police investigating Scarboro found that he had been regularly talking to the Child on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and found out how he got to the Kid's house in Blackburn and put 60 percent clean drugs in a black cap for golf under the garbage bins of the lawyer.
Soon after the transfer, Scarboro was repeatedly summoned to Dieta, who was at dinner at the Iwood Park football stadium, Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer returned home for drugs, and nine conversations took place between them.
The court found that Dieta had “ regular use” of cocaine after the tests had found traces of Class A drugs in his hair, shirt and credit cards.
The child was later arrested, but he denied cocaine use, said he was talking to the suspect dealer because it was his client, and insisted that their communication is a “advocacy secret”.
At the time of her arrest, the Child took his paper and tried to draw several credit cards, but they were all confiscated, and he also had a hair sample.
He told the police that, along with his workplace, he had a home office, and his clients came to him at home on legal matters.
However, the court was aware that after important arrests, it had called the largest parties to illicit drug trafficking, some of which it had previously presented to the court to tell them what detectives knew about them.
In the indictment, Anne White said, "If anyone knows that the law should not be violated, he is a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Dieta was accused of abuse of his position as a criminal lawyer, since he had become too close to certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly prove fair, since he was their lawyer.
However, this has significantly crossed the limits of the usual relationship between the lawyer and the client.
He prevented police investigations as strongly as possible to enable these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Detta didn't read his profession, but he hit her.
He was too close to certain clients, in particular Scarboro, and allowed him to doubt his lack of interest.
The child did not admit his guilt and said, “If I were a corrupt lawyer that I was not, and I wanted to pass on Mr. Scarboro’s information, I would not wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately.”
But after the meeting, Chief Officer Li Holstead of the Lankasira Police said: “Mr. Dieta has become a criminal lawyer as soon as she began to buy drugs from organized crime”.
His addiction to cocaine has made it hopelessly complicated and vulnerable for the main participants of criminal groups, who have commissioned him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should follow the highest standards of professional ethics and build trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Dietta betrayed that trust and tried to cover up his profession.
Mr. Dieta's investigation led the Lankasira Specially Organized Crime Unit, which had already been sentenced to three cases of cocaine storage, and now even to the prevention of the implementation of justice, demonstrating our desire to achieve a just punishment for the offenders.
Let this matter serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
He himself was sentenced to 14 years after admitting his guilt in the dispute with a view to supplying heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
A further 35 persons involved in machining were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his site, the Child organized a discussion in the form of questions and answers in which he said that the work of his dream was a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, the ideal companion for him for dinner -- Mohammed Ali, and motivation in work is inequality.
The stadium in Jaroslavle is not ready for the reception of 22,000 spectators, police officials who were present at the meeting of the RFSC.
They believe that the ticket programme has been exceeded about twice.
During the 1/16 match, only a thousand squadrons were deployed by the Russian Cup with Spartacus, with a rule of nine thousand.
Spartacus patients had 2200 seats, i.e. 10 per cent of the capacity of the stadium, but according to the Moscow club, they had sold 5,000 tickets.
These data were published by the Head of KDK Arthur Grigorjanz.
The Americans listened to Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, 1 November, one of the representatives of the American special services, who chose not to disclose their names, said that the States had been listening to telephone talks by senior officials of Japan.
The person confirmed that there were several points in the rising sun for the hearing.
He noted, however, that the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand did not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
He said that this was the case during World War II when these countries were allies.
And here is Japan, like Germany, despite the alliance with Americans in the post-war period, as well, are intelligence facilities, the NHK telechannel reported.
None of the parties officially commented on this information.
Remember, news of the U.S. special services report for the Frog Chancellor appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the ANB has been able to listen to Merkel’s phone for the past ten years.
The chancellor himself, according to some data, took notice of his interrogation very painfully.
She stated that the allies, which she considered, were FRG and the United States for decades, were such an unacceptable observation of the head of the Government.
In the meantime, Edward Snowden said that he was ready to share details of the phone interview with German prosecutors, Angela Merkel.
Germany has specifically come to Moscow to meet with a former CIA officer.
Basheria can exhibit seed on the market not before the beginning of 2014
In the course of public procurement interventions, the bakery may exhibit seed on the market not before the beginning of 2014, according to the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
As long as the price in the market is above and there's a question.
"Maybe the grain will be displayed on the market after the New Year," he said at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister recalled that agricultural crops under harvest in 2013 were 3.1 million hectares, including seed crops, 1.7 million hectares, which was 3.3 per cent higher than last year.
During the harvest of 2014, 550 thousand ha (over 105,000 ha) were planted in 2012.
Increased areas under the zomal wheat and triticale, the rose remained at the former level.
There is no "British Circle" group based on the MDDs to which Leps was assigned in the United States.
In the databases of the Russian forces of the Bratsky Circle group, to which Washington attributed the singer Gregory Leps, it does not matter.
As Interfax noted in the law enforcement authorities of the RF, after media reports of the submission by the US Ministry of Finance by Gregory Leps to the suspicious checklists of the Eurasian criminal union, all databases were checked, but no such grouping was found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called “Russian mafia”, which is allegedly operating abroad, is considered to be in force.
"Even in the very name of the 'British Circle', there's a secret element, there's a space on a secret bed.
"It's all very similar to pier-action," said the agency's interviewer.
The United States Ministry of Finance announced on 31 October that it had entered its lists of suspects belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate, Artura Badalian, Grígoria Lepsveride, Vadima Lálina, Sergei Moskalenko, Jakova Ribalski and Igoria Schlzykova.
The persons included in the list are suspected of being in contact with some of the Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rahimov, who are considered to be members of the criminal groups and are in the U.S. sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Gregory Leps "is a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev".
At the producer centre, Gregory Lepsa refused to comment on the U.S. charges against the singer, calling them "the board".
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama referred to the "British Circle" union as "substantial transnational organized criminal groups" and commissioned the Minfin to "encourage and defend their global criminal operations".
The introduction of a person to the American Mining Black List entails blocking his assets in the United States and prohibiting business contacts with individuals living in the United States.
The scandal video went to the police
The head of Toronto Rob Ford, known for its scandalous and unreasonably unreasonably outlawed, has fallen into the smoke of the creek.
The Canadian City Police stated that they had an appropriate video and were ready to start an investigation against the mayor.
He said he wouldn't leave his post, told CNN.
Information that the authorities have evidence of drug use by Rob Ford has appeared on the Toronto police site.
The head of the local law enforcement authorities, Bill Blair, held a press conference in this regard.
The Sheriff said that he was not authorized to share the personnel with the public, but he was given the right to do so.
According to Blair, the compromised Robb Forda video was discovered during the anti-narcotic raid held in the summer of 2013.
The Canadian press had already written about the existence of this video, but no confirmations had been made until recently.
The mayor himself does not give any comments on this.
He's just saying that they don't blame anything and they don't retire.
The video found by the police is one of the evidence in the case of a 35-year-old friend of Ford Aleksandra Lisa, who is accused of drug trafficking, demand, receipt of illegal income, and criminal conspiracy.
Sometimes Lissie served as Rob Ford's driver.
The city's inhabitants have long been demanding retirement from their mayor.
He fought with journalists repeatedly, appeared in a drunken audience, allowed himself to be racist and sexist.
The Rostovaeroinvest OAO recognized Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the selection of the projector.
The amount of the contract in Rostovaeuroves is not disclosed.
According to the OAS press, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, under the terms of the tender, the project should be prepared and sent to the expert in spring 2014.
The winner must design a new passenger terminal at the airport, as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and elements of the airport complex.
During the first phase of the construction of the internal terminal area, the terminal area will be 50 thousand sqm, and it will continue to increase.
According to Rostovaeuroinvest, the project documentation will take into account the prospects for the development of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers and by 2035, 6 million passengers.
By the time the tender was drawn up, the architectural concept of the Southern Air Force was defined, which was developed by the British company Twelve Architects.
The project of the main terminal building covers the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-na-Donu and other cities of the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience in major projects, the company has designed the C and E Terminals of Sheremetevo International Airport and the new Knevici International Airport complex in Vladivostok.
The International South Airport complex will be built in the Gulf of Asia and will replace the current growth of the airport, which will be closed and integrated in the urban setting.

Politician in Turkey announced a hunger strike against the border wall with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began building a separation wall in the Nusaib area of south-east Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the PMD procured party strongly opposed the construction.
A mayor on the border with Syria of the Turkish city of Nusaibin Ayeche Gekhan announced a famine protest against the construction of a separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, reported the RIA News in the Press Service of the Party of Peace and Democracy (PMD) on Friday.
The police have repeatedly launched protest demonstrations.
The head of the media in Turkey, Muammer Guller, first rejected the fact of the construction, then stated that the wall was built to ensure the safety of borders.
"Mer Nusaibina Ayeche Gekhan, a member of the PMD, announced the hunger strike, thus turning his protest against the construction of the wall into a death row," the party said in press service.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of two countries from one another, the Kurds crossed the border freely during the six months.
"This is an inhuman situation with which the Kurds never agree," Ische Gekhan quoted the party's representatives.
According to the press, on 7 November, a meeting against the construction of the separation wall was planned in Nusaibina.
Venezuela will set a currency course for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency, a bolivar, with respect to the dollar for tourists.
This was reported by Bloomberg on 1 November with reference to government decree.
Foreign travellers will be allowed to exchange the amounts equivalent to tens of thousands of US dollars per year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the goods purchased in the country at the time of departure.
A specific rate of dollar-dollar will be set at a later date.
In February, Karakas was forced to vacate the local currency up to 6.3 bolivars per dollar.
However, in the black market, one dollar is estimated at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 per cent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela accounted for almost 50 per cent.
The Minister of the Oil Industry and Vice-President of the Economy, Rafael Ramirez, said on 18 October that Venezuela had no plans to devalue the bolivar.
According to the informal information brought by the agency, Karakas could nevertheless decide to reduce the national currency rate after the municipal elections in December.
A policy to curb prices for products and goods of high consumption, as well as the high level of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, has led to the deficit of a number of goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported a lack of toilet paper in Venezuela.
South Director Andrei Belmach said it was difficult to say how long it would take to find a new master coach.
This post became vacant after Sergei Shepelev resigned.
The resignation took place only a few hours ago, so to say how long it will take to find a new coach, I'm not ready - ITAR-TASS brings Belmach's words.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're studying all possible options.
The priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I don't just want to find a coach, but a person who works at our club for a few years and gets some results.
The Kenyan press is upset by the provocation law on media
“This is a terrible place, and there are reasons for the question: what could prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?” said the newspaper, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very severe and punishable, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, director of Capital Group, the parent company CapitalFM, which is one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites in Kenya.
He said that the new media judicial body “will always be biased, as it is a continuation of the Government”, and the content and advertising restrictions would harm Kenya in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us and we are asking him to reject this bill and return it to his deputies," he said.
According to The Star, the new law would in fact allow the Government to “take the media by a dead catch”, and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya “had a serious impact”, and criticised the bill as “drakonovski”.
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security after the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate Trade Centre.
Kenyan media have provoked the anger of the authorities by broadcasting surveillance cameras, where troops who have been sent to the scene of the attack are allegedly robbing the expensive mall.
In response to police chief David Kimayo, two journalists and media officials were called on to question, although the challenge was lifted after mass media protests.
Under the new publication law, up to 20 million Kenyan shillings may be fined, and individual journalists, up to one million at a further risk of being “exempted from the lists”, i.e. to receive a ban on official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one fine is enough to paralyze the work of most FM radio stations”.
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on the so-called “reliving blogosphere” of Kenya.
Politicians understand that by forcing the media to shut up, they can do everything they think they can without punishment.
“No one will ever know,” wrote journalist Nation Mutuma Matthew, describing Kenya’s media as a key source of deterrence and balance in public life.
“The policies themselves will tear the country apart and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan legislators were the target of public anger and in the past.
In May, they voted for the abolition of reductions appointed by the National Wages Commission and the restoration of their huge salary of around 532,000 shillings per month, one of the highest in the world.
A new line of expenditure will be introduced in community payments - capital repairs at home.
The nearest estimate for the standard two-room apartment from the new year will be 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The precise rules will determine the Government of the region.
So when you dress up the train, bring the ladders in order, or even replace the elevator, the lodgers themselves will decide.
This law was approved by the Members of the district council.
Vladimir Kluchnikov, president of the Voroneje district council, said: "In this case, it is also necessary to establish the order of the house carremont, to accumulate funds from non-government companies - which we often register in Moscow, or in Orenburg, or elsewhere, it will be the establishment of State control over the expenditure of funds collected by residents for the repair of multi-quarter houses."
Under the control of the State, construction is now on the left.
The law that protects against fraud is approved by the final reading.
The document wasn't born in an empty place.
In our region, 4.5 thousand people have been injured by dishonest fixtures.
Most of the problems have been solved.
In fact, the new law prescribes rights and responsibilities for all participants in the left-hand construction.
Vladimir Kluchnikov, President of the Voronejes District Palace, said: “It is not a secret that abuses have also begun in this area as regards the fact that in the 98th year the same dolls have fallen, and in the 2000s the same dolls.”
People started working on it to cover the lasaika, including the two laws.
Under Voronez, it was decided to build a temporary residence centre for foreign nationals to be deported.
The Regional Parliament has adopted such legislation not only under the force of the federation.
At least remove the problem of illegal migrants in the region.
Yes, over 100,000 foreigners were heard on the migration account last year.
But only every fifth had a formal permit for work.
Where the others work, and if they pay taxes, it's a big question.
Vladimir Kluchnikov, President of the Voronejes District Court, said: "They have violated the law, but they are not criminals."
There is no court, and the court has to deport them, and they have to be held somewhere.
Such a decision was taken by the Federation to equip such sites with regional resources.
In the Vronez area, it is defined as the Old Olshank of the Semiluk region.
Well, after all, the regional parliament has given new benefits to multi-child parents.
First, families with 5 and more children are completely exempt from transport tax.
The budget in this case is lost 3.5 million - but many children are also saving.
Secondly, and this is the main thing, for those who adopt the 3rd and younger, will issue housing subsidies from the new year.
For each member of the family, the new law provides for 18 square meters, at the cost of 30 thousand meters.
The family, for example, of the 6 people, the father, the mother, the child and the third adopted.
For them, according to the regulations, the State purchases a housing area of 108 square meters, over 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left bank or the South-West microregion, it's an acceptable option.
Well, you can buy a whole cottage at the mall for that.
Baumgertner nominated by the Uralkaliya Board of Directors
The current Board of Directors of OAS Uralkali proposed a candidature of Director-General Vladislav Baumgertner arrested in Minsk in a new composition of the Board, reported on the website of the Russian company.
Bamugertner listed 11 persons appointed to the new Board of Directors.

However, the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, said at the press conference that the allegations of Baumgertner were reclassified as "a theft".
Mother Dalton's Nephtheism Gate refused to comment on Vladimir Crikunov's departure from the post of inferior teacher.
Golkiper believes that the senior coach Dmitri Balmin has a high degree of authority in the players and will handle their responsibilities.
Remember, "Nephtheamik" has left Crikunov's resignation today.

U.S. Secretary-General: Specialist services sometimes "extended too far" when collecting data
The U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that, in collecting data and searches, American services sometimes “were too far away”, however, the politician noted that the media's information on the polling of 70 million people did not match the reality.
I assure you that innocent people did not suffer during this process, but the attempt to collect information was.
Yes, in some cases this was too far away and was wrong.
I recognize this, as the President also acknowledges... and we will see to it that this does not happen in the future," the Secretary-General of the AFP quoted.
Italian interns take the road to youth
Italian unemployment is a record.
The data published on the environment showed that 12.5 per cent of the country ' s population was now unemployed.
So bad things haven't happened since World War II.
Among young people, this figure is a number of times higher.
40.4% of the population aged 15 to 24 are unemployed.
In the view of the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
This experiment is already being carried out by the country's largest energy company, and the laws adopted allow regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement pension for intern workers.
On the other hand, Italy expects the common problem of ageing for Europe.
And economists are not sure that a delay in the early rotation of personnel is justified.
What will lead to the construction of TPUs in Moscow
Each year, the chairing authorities promise to build ever-increasing transport-persading networks (TSIs).
By 2020, it is planned to introduce 255 TPUs.
As far as the project is concerned, our correspondent understood it.
A few months ago, the Arbatsko-Pakrovo line was built at the Smolensko Metro.
The signature stated that there was a vehicle for the transport-passage unit.
All this was very strange, because near Smolens, no land transport is stopped and, therefore, it cannot be moved.
In order to reach the nearest trolleybus stop in the Sadov ring, it is necessary to cross some 130 metres, including a land crossing through the Carmanicki pass.
It's almost done with Smolens.
A flower lare, a demounted paper stand, and the asphalt was replaced by a brush before the entrance.
That's all the transport he took.
Transport-per-seasonal angles are flat and capitalized, explained in the press services of the capital transport department.
There are no capital IPRs yet.
The flats include the construction of parks, the conclusion of commercial facilities that prevent passengers from moving, the creation of small architectural shapes and well-being.
In fact, flat-duty ICUs are not even used by transporters, but professional charity workers from the capital repair department of Moscow.
The transport industry is not necessarily a complex structure, explains the Director of the Institute of Transport and Transport Policy of the Higher Economic School, Michael Blinkin.
Sometimes enough covers over the head and the board that announce the time of arrival of the transport.
Here, for example, the Yasenevo Metro recently opened a full-fledged flat replanting plant.
Let's go with no blankets, but with pick-up parks and a board showing when the bus arrives.
But in pursuit of the number of officers, they record everything in the ICU.
As early as 2011, Mary planned to build all 151 of them, 59 of them with capital construction.
The plans for 2020 now total up to 255 GSTs.
Half of them promise to surrender this year.
Although there is a programme of development of the IPR in the city, there is no qualitative criteria, says Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the State and Transport Organization.
The number of objects is reported, but the quality of the transplant on each of them is often deteriorating.
The criteria, according to the expert, must be two: firstly, reduction of the transplant time, secondly, convenience.
First of all, it is possible to change the type of transport without rain.
In Moscow, however, when the TPU is set up, it is time to go straight back.
A bright example of the VDNH Metro.
Earlier, beautiful buses from the Jaroslav Shoss had arrived in the camp before the main entrance to the VWC.
Their arrests were now transferred to the opposite side of Yaroslavka on the streets of the Cosmonauts.
Far from the subway, far away from the monoreel, so close to home.
Because the people did not want a car under the windows and complained at all possible instances.
With the capital ICU in Moscow, something didn't happen right away.
The first of them started building five years ago at Plannerna Metro.
The project was designed to be a model.
And indeed, a sample of how the replanting of the purchase of investors is turned into a shopping mall.
No, there's a perv for buses, a wet to keep out of the subway under the rain, and three floors of the parking lot.
True, the chemical trolleybuses No.202 and No.203 in the Moscow TPU did not give seats in principle.
They're as far away from the subway as I'm concerned.
That's why there's more places to trade.
There is only one 32 store, and there are almost everything from zoos to car salon.
Well, in fact, someone else on the bus would need to buy a new car on the way?
When we build a capital facility, why is there always a trading center?
The situation recently reached its logical conclusion when a part of the parking lot decided to give up the market.
Now on the third floor of the "Planner" TPU, fighting trade is taking place among those seen in the parking lot.
Plants, species, Chinese giants, neuroscientists and guardians who look at our photographer.
The replanter finally turned into a market.
The thing is, Plannerna was a market earlier, but it was taken off.
And in the prefecture, the merchants were sorry and left for the catchment area of the replanting plant.
Still, because of high prices there is always empty.
The funny thing about the market is to build on it... a new flat system.
That's the rocking.
The "Kalujski" metro was 50 meters away from the bus's vestibule, as told by Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the shopping centre, the TPP reportedly increased to 170 metres.
To get on the bus, we have to go through the whole shopping center.
After 22 hours, when he closes, he must be surrounded by the open sky.
On the other hand, the constructions of Planner and Kalujska will soon be shown by flowers.
In mid-September, the Mayor ' s Land-building Commission adopted planning decisions for the first eight capital IAPs.
Four of them would be 25-yarded, without considering two or three underground bulls.
The main sample will grow at the Tushino Metro, with 418.7 thousand square meters of space.
The representatives of the RJD Railway Stations Department, responsible for the construction of the subway, have already told reporters: in future multi-storey shops, hotels and apartments will be available.
In this way, officials are convinced that the multi-year parks are worth a third to half of the area.
Let's take the "national" garages.
For example, the 258 parking garage, which has recently been built on the International Street, has an area of 8015 square meters.
So, for parking for 2.6 thousand cars at Petrovsko-Razumovska, about 80 thousand "squares" will be needed.
It's less than a third of the machine they're going to build there.
Let one or two floors go on every bus platform.
It remains at least 150 thousand square meters of commercial property.
And for a minute, it's almost two GUMAs.
If the capital IPRs are built by railways at stations and trains, the remaining sites will be occupied by the metropolitans.
They also promised that there would be many "functional objects", including hotels, offices and even sports halls.
In fact, the property department of Moscow has recently informed journalists that they are developing a draft decision that enables investors to apply for a site for ICT to officials directly.
No competitions.
Therefore, he prayed that the transport issues for the city were a priority.
The ideal TPU is, for example, the Garvard Station in Boston or the Downtown Station in Toronto, and Alexander Morozov is sure.
The trolleybuses and trams are down the ground at metro level and the distance from the metro to tram wagon is only 50 metres without leaving the street.
No more trade.
But the Moscow officials are in the end.
Either we don't build anything, or we're gonna have to rent 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Eser proposes to compare the abuse of patriotic feelings with extremism
In order to protect the patriotic feelings of citizens against provocations and insults against Russia, the Just Russia proposed to compare the insulting of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to punish them for five years in prison.
As reported in the “Report” newspaper, such amendments to the legislation prepared by the mental committee on energy by Oleg Miheev have already been sent to obtain a judgment before the Supreme Court and the Government.
Under the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendment proposes to understand the emotional relationship of a person with the country of which he is a citizen, who is in love with that country, who is responsible for its fate, respect for its history and culture.
As Micah points out, domestic legislation provides for sanctions for abuse of the formal signs of the State ' s flag and herb.
However, in the opinion of the MP, the protection of Russians whose feelings may be affected and insulted by public symbols, and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, Russian legislation has not been sufficiently worked out.
As an example, he introduced a discussion that was taking place annually in the Canon of the Day of Victory, when some media individuals allowed themselves to question the heroic defeat of the people of the USSR in the fight against the Fascists.
Before the main public festival, the 9th of May, the current vacancy is being launched annually.
While exercising in an astrology and an "alternative view" of history, some publicists argue that, unfortunately, cultural Germans did not win the Soviet Union!
I consider this to be absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the nation's main "spiritual strength"," regrets Oleg Mikheev.
In addition, Miheeva said that patriotic people in Russia were much more than religious, but the law was punishing the feelings of believers and that patriotic feelings could be almost harmless.
In the opinion of the people ' s electorate, it is necessary to compare the insulting of patriotic feelings to extremism and to prescribe appropriate punishment in article 282 of the Penal Code.
The bill provides for punishment for the insulting of patriotic feelings, ranging from 100 thousand to 5 years of imprisonment.
The earthquake of 6.6 occurred on Thursday, 31 October, in the area of Kokimbo, central Chile, by the Reuters agency.
Earthquake was located in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and 54 kilometres south-west of the city, specified on the U.S. Geological Service (USGS).
The scores were recorded at 20:03 on local time (3:03 1 November in Moscow).
Victims or subterranean destructions have not yet been reported.
Remember, Chile is in one of the most seismic regions of the earth, so the earthquakes of different forces are not rare.
One of the most serious events occurred in 2010.
At that time, the earthquake of 8.8 and the tsunami caused more than 550 deaths in Chile and the destruction of 220 thousand buildings.
In addition, the most powerful earthquake occurred in Chile in the latest history: in 1960 there was a magnitude 9.5.
More than five thousand people were killed as a result of that natural disaster.
Dmitry Medvedev: the Greenpeace case will be considered fairly
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev reported on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists would be dealt with in strict accordance with Russian law.
France may not doubt that the case will be dealt with in compliance with the legislation, we hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee law enforcement," said Dmitry Medvedev at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean Mark Ero.
Greenpeace is a French citizen among the detained activists.
Pierre Pizanou, as well as the other activists, are charged with felony.
"I asked if we could expect humanitarian violence against a detainee," Mr. Ero quoted RIA News.
"Our country cannot support activities that can harm the environment, no one has the right to violate the laws," Dmitry Medvedev said.
He said that the activities of any structure that sought to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy generation, were dangerous.
He stressed that these objects were "as dusty as a bottle", and recalled what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, conveying "RA News".
UN announces new poverty eradication goals
The United Nations must begin its work immediately on a new set of challenges for the replacement of the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to address poverty worldwide.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the goals of “sustainable development” on the change of the MDGs, which expires in 2015 until the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro earlier in the evening.
They were included in the outcome version of the document, which would be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Hillard, at the summit.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, told the summit early in the evening that it was now time to “become more of national interest”.
“I am pleased that the UN member states have agreed to launch and monitor the process of creating the universal goals of sustainable development, the ESD,” he said.
These ESDs will build on our progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, and they will become an integral part of the post-2015 development concept.
I will make every effort to use the powers given to me by Member States to translate our vision of the goals of sustainable development that are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as a result of the conflict of influential people
Under the view of them at the bottom of the statue of Samara Muschel, the President-founder of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scan the world slogans for one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want to return to peace; we want stability,” said Vanessa de-Susa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing the future of her country, she changed her business suit into a football suit decorated with the inscription “We Need Security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday at the Table of Independence.
Within two weeks, almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renajam have been reported — one of the most cruel encounters since the end of the siege more than 20 years ago.
Renom was once a well-known rebel movement supported by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the Government of South Africa at the apartheid era in efforts to destabilize the independent Government of the country.
After the peace of 1992 it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country will soon return to full-scale conflict, but recent developments have forced foreign investors and locals to be nervous.
High rates for the fast-growing economy, as the opening of huge greenhouse gas and coal reserves in the north-west may attract more than $50 billion as investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
Frelimo's leading political party since 1975, and Renom's party are blaming each other for the tensions that have been created.
The Renom Party argues that the Government has become the founder of the last clashes, attacking its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional area of Renom, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels then intensified when government forces attacked the base of Renanam and tried to kill Afonso Dlakam, a group leader, reported the Financial Times Fernando Mazanga, representative of Renanam.
The Government blames Renom for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking the soldier.
President Armandu Gebuz tried to raise concerns about instability.
Gebuza told the French Information Agency that Mr. Dlakama had felt “a failure”, who wanted to use “all that remained of his strength to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the Government”.
Both Frelimo and Renomous insist that they want to avoid war.
However, the fears grew after the announcement that Mazanga had said that Rehoboam had refused the 1992 peace agreement.
He informed the Financial Times that it was a violation of the agreement by the Frelimo party.
"Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but with all seriousness," Mazanga said.
The previous negotiations between the parties had little to do with the tensions that intensified the series of clashes this year.
“These are two influential people (Gebuza and Dlakama), who have met with lips,” said Joseph Hanlon, lecturer of the Open University and expert in Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them are ready to go to the necessary appointments.
The Renoam Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already stated that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt to achieve a weaker movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the Government.
The proportion of the votes for Renom has decreased since 1992, while the new Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which is based on a former member of Renom, is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gabuza, who had to leave the post next year when his second term ended, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want multiparty democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is not clear what opportunities Renajam has, but it has already carried out devastating and urgent attacks on police stations and cars on the key highway from the north to the south.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofia, located hundreds of miles north of Maputo, but included Beirut, a port used by mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, to export coal.
In June, Rio stopped the use of railways about a week after Renom was threatened by an attack on the railway.
Mazanga was withdrawn when he was asked if Renoma would repeat this threat.
The Renamo Party wanted to “warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not going very well”, Mazanga said.
Dissatisfaction has increased the dissatisfaction of the Government, and many people are also concerned with corruption, slow development and recent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, which should also find a solution to these problems,” he said.
Omar Sultuan, part of the demonstration, said that people just want stability.
"No one cares about Renom or Frelimo, they just want to restore peace, they want free access to roads," he said.
The series of Art Mainstream premieres will take place in Moscow
The Art Mainstream film series, where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films within a few days of their release to the screen, will take place at the Rolan Film Theatre from 1 to 5 November, reports the RIA News with reference to project organizers.
Opens the Art Mainstream program by French director and actress Reim Kerichi, Paris at any price.
This is a story about the Maye model working in the French capital (Sama Kerichi), which is being deported to Morocco due to a visa issue.
In addition to Kerichi's film, the audience will also show a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Duka "Mebius", the melodramatic biopist Oliver Hirshbigel "Diana: History of Love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the main role and the main film of the Cannes Film Festival "Life Adel" Abdelatif Cashisha.
The only Russian participant, Art Mainstream, will be the winner of the film by Alexander Veledin's Geographe Globus Propil at the "Kinotavr" Festival.
The main role - the ambitious failed teacher Victor Słujkin - was played in the film by Constantine Habenski, whose work was also noted by the prize "Kinotavara".
Children should study myths and legends as “life patterns”, says the author.
The Tale's statements could show that “the harsh force cannot defeat the subtle wisdom”, and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
In saying that many myths would appear to be “too wild, too scandalous and, in some cases, too rude to teach in schools”, Crossley-Holland advocates the “adult selection” of texts of age.
“I think it’s wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I voted in favour of introducing them into the 20-year training programme.
He added that “exceeding moralism” by authors and teachers “is of interest” to children, and the main ideas are “sublimated” in interesting stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowolf from English-Saxon, and wrote "Norwegian Miffin Collection" for Penguin and "British folk stories", said, "You may have intentions, but you better keep them with you."
Perhaps there is a great difference between the adult author who writes for adults and the adult author who writes for children.
Not that everything should be simplified or brought to a happy conclusion, but that there must be a clear understanding of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; it's revealed through history, not clearly formulated.
Old principle: to show, not to tell.
In the Vronez area, a football fan broke down the window in the waiting room
At nine o'clock on the evening of 29 October, at the Georgian-Voronnez police station, two football fans from Moscow were taken off the passenger train.
Going to a favorite team, the guys on the way set up a drunk deboss on the train.
Young people were delivered to the police station at the police station for the preparation of the protocol on administrative offences.
There the fanatics fought in their anti-social behavior.
The police formed administrative material on them and fired them.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and were waiting for him to arrive at the station.
In the middle of the first night, the fans left the railway station, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly came back and broke the window of the front door in the waiting room.
There was a breakdown of the glass on the side of a transport police officer and the guard of the RZD.
They were able to detain a criminal who tried to hide from the scene.
Russia's South-East ILO staff are being audited.
The issue of the initiation of a criminal case was resolved by the senior reference to the information and public communications of the South-East IMF of Russia on the transport of Sergei Olhovik.
Vital Mutko: Watermelons?
I think we're back at 15 years.
Minister of Sports Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion on the riots at the courts during the match of the Russian Cup of Shinnik - Spartak.
I am in favour of all this being the responsibility of the organizers of sports events: clubs, leagues, RFS.
But we see that they've taken a position.
They're waiting for someone on the side to come and order.
It's a very good position, but it's not exactly right.
Sick people should be organized, clubs should invite their drivers, not leave the case on their own.
We have now drawn up a special Government decision on the rules of conduct at the stadiums.
Once it has been adopted, we will take care of this problem.
But I still have to invite all the football organizers.
I read Leonid Fedun's interview.
State, please, give the law a hurry.
It's such a feeling that the Bavarian patients came to Yaroslavl and they put it all together.
And we're alien observers.
And it's terrible at all to see the tribe being driven out of the brandpoint.
And it's in the country that's preparing for the world championship.
"I feel like we've been back 10-15 years," Mutko said.
Snoudena can be questioned in Russia
U.S. Specialist Edward Snowden will probably not go beyond Russia to give evidence on the phone negotiation of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
As Interfax stated on Friday, a well-known source, an American can answer questions from the German Geno-Pacific Office in writing or in an eye-opening way in Russia.
The departure of Edward Snowden outside Russia is almost off.
"In this case, he loses refugee status and may be issued to Washington by US allies," said the interviewer of the agency.
“However, in principle, the FRG's Office could send its representatives to the FF or forward written questions to Snouden,” added the source, adding that the issue should be handled at an inter-State level.
Former German Bundestag, Hans-Christian Strebele, reported that Edward Snowden was ready to give evidence on the investigation of the US special services of the Chancellor of Germany's negotiations.
Snouden is willing to testify to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or in Germany.
The CIA's ex-employee has made it clear that he knows a lot.
Despite the fact that the U.S.A. has blocked all its movements, Snowden is willing to come to Germany.
However, it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival," Strebele told Euronews.
Advocate Snouden Antonio Kucheren, commenting on the "Interfax" source, said his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how he would decide on his own.
U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (UNB) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after reporting on the secret operations of U.S. intelligence on the Internet.
Snoudden flew through Moscow transit, but could not leave the airport because his passport had been cancelled by the US authorities who had brought him serious charges, and remained in the Sheremetevo transit area before the beginning of August.
On August 1st, Snouden received a document on granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a year and on the same day left Sheremetevo.
Yesterday, American lawyer Anatoly Kucheren said his client was set up for work in a "big Russian company".
A report by the German media last week about the ANB report by Angela Merkel.
According to journalists, the US Chancellor's phone calls began to be heard in 2002.
The tracking station was reportedly in the United States Embassy in Berlin.
Following the publication of this information, the German authorities stated that Merkel's note violated Germany's laws and sovereignty.
Ponamerev left "Just Russia"
A member of her office in Novosibirsk, Ilia Ponomrev, a member of the State Duma from the Fair Russia party, made a statement on the withdrawal from the political organization.
As the parliamentarians said, he made a statement to the New Siberian Regional Office of the Party.
According to her statute, it automatically means that Ponomrev has left a number of "rights".
We'll sit down, have a cup of tea...
"Why do many want to see the painting "Elya Ponomrev puts on a parquet table," but there's nothing like that," the MP commented.
Ponamerev noted that he maintained good relations with the Esser regional office.
However, Mr. Ilia Ponomrev ' s mandate was not intended to be refused.
He explained that, despite leaving the party, he remained a member of the faction and could not be expelled by law.
The announcements about the intention of Eli Ponomreva to leave the Fair Russia party appeared on 30 October.
It was reported that Dmitri Gudkov and Valerie Zubov would leave with him, but the latter soon rejected this information.
Japan will discuss the conclusion of a peace treaty with Russia
The head of the Japanese MIDI Fumio Kisida met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"We would like to exchange views openly on further development of political dialogue, discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty," Kisida said at the meeting.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that after Japan's Prime Minister Sindzo Abe visited Russia, relations between countries became warmer and bilateral.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the RF would meet Japan in addressing difficult political issues, writes the RIA Novosti.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies solutions to the issue of the disputed Northern Territories.
In this regard, the protests in Tokyo today demand the return of the country lost after World War II.
The Japanese capital is driven by cars, from which the loudspeaker says, "Return the northern territories!".
The police don't stop the protestors, they're watching them not to exceed the noise level.
Ben Greenman: 10th anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
We can boldly claim that New York is the birthplace of a stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, an experienced artist Frank Fay, who worked at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the audience in the conversation.
In time, the innovation of the Féy was promoted by others, recently the New York Comedy Festival.
An established and curated Caroline Hersh, founder of the Carolines Standapp Club, is celebrating this year's tenth anniversary, with more than 60 shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these hedliners started in Carolines, and then they achieved more success, reached the level when they were already too famous to be at the club,” said Hersh.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year, the event includes Vanda Sykes, Katie Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as the “Stendap pour Heroev” — an annual musical and comedy charity concert for military veterans in Madison Square Garden, where the other Bruce Springstin, John Stuart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby appear.
The world of comedy has expanded with the expansion of the festival.
Several comedians participating in the festival this year have gained popularity in a non-traditional way, such as by showing on small television shows such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Croll got acquainted with the role in the comedy series on a known cable channel (especially the FXX League on the subject of fantasy football) and now runs his own comedy Central ski show.
Jenny Slett was involved in both "Sunday Night in Direct Air", and "Parks and Retirement Zone", although she was the most famous in the series of virus roles "Marcel - Hand in Botinques".
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with a self-styled personality (surrealist pessimistic Anthony Jesselnik, a sleek, racially focused Kamau Bell) are the result of a decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the brightest moments of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a standup comedy, but then became a successful director on TV and in movies, as well as an informal historical comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the lead show on TV Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held in Town Hall, downtown Manhattan.
“This city is definitely the central part of Larry’s whole work,” said Steinberg.
He told me that when he comes here, he sometimes plays around in a corner between the two houses, and he thinks, "If I'm left with no money, maybe I'll live here."
Pakistani authorities began negotiations with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities started negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the Embassy of the country in the United Kingdom, where Pakistan's Prime Minister Navaz Sharif is visiting.
The head of the Government of Pakistan made a statement on negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Niko Klegg, with which he discussed Pakistan and India's relations, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
“The Prime Minister reported that the Taliban dialogue had begun,” said the Pakistani Embassy in London.
He said he hoped and prayed that dialogue would work in accordance with the Constitution of Pakistan," added the diplomats.
Pakistani Taliban (Tekrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of a single Afghan movement, but operate independently in the north-west regions of the country bordering Afghanistan.
Pakistani Taliban are seeking to establish an Islamic State.
The Government of Islamabad had earlier tried to start negotiations with local Taliban, but the movement had refused the dialogue.
It stated that negotiations would take place only if the authorities were to take the permanent deployment of troops located in areas where the Taliban were active and to release the Islamic prisoners from prison.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, Head of the Government of Pakistan, and Afghan President Hamid Karzai, held a tripartite meeting in London, discussing the prospects of the peace process in Afghanistan.
The oil dropped to $96 for the barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, when the concerns about large stocks had become cloudy, indicating that China's energy-intensive manufacturing sector had gained power.
The U.S. ethanol oil stock was delivered in December at 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 for a barrel at a late-morning European time in electronic stores at the New York Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract was awarded 39 cents, which amounted to an October price drop of 5.8 per cent.
The rich oil stocks have influenced its value in the last few weeks.
The Ministry of Energy stated on Wednesday that US stockpiles have increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, more than 25 million barrels were filled.
However, on Friday, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, according to two reports on the Chinese industry, which demonstrated the collapse of its activity.
This indicates that the recovery of China ' s economy may continue to take effect after the growth rate in the third quarter rose to 7.8 per cent after a 20-year minimum in the previous quarter.
The oil Brent, also used by U.S. oil-processing companies, provided 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel at the London Intercontinental Stock Exchange.
The lead coach of Colorado Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release the Golchiper of Semen Varlamov from the first minute in the Friday match with Dallas, expressed confidence that the last night after the event did not break his confidence in the Russians, he handed over from Dallas to Natalia Smeleva.
And what we're waiting for, Rua said after the morning break, "Lavin."
Of course, we all worry about what happened, but we are confident of it and feel that it will be helpful for him to get out of the ice today.
We want him to get on the ice and show his usual level.
So you're absolutely sure that the situation hasn't worked out at the door?
I'll see you today.
Our players will undoubtedly support Varley's efforts to help him keep the door open, as it was in previous season's match-ups.
Mainly, no one in the team is going to make any conclusions until the court finds out.
In Siberia there is no need to be a fork: a warm tomato will not replace a hat
Why the vegetarians do not live in Siberia, the correspondent of the RIA Novosti explained.
People who have completely renounced products of animal origin should not live in Siberia.
They do not spend the winter without loss of health, and no hot tomatoes compensate them, they are considered to have been questioned early on the Vegan Day by new Siberian dietologists and doctors.
Five litres of oil
The strict vegetarianism, when not only of meat and fish, but also of milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, dietists are convinced that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia, there are strict food standards, at least, that it is useless for health.
Full rejection of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain irreplaceable amino acids that are very difficult to compensate for.
It is necessary to include at least milk or eggs in the treatment," - confirmed dietologist Marina Godi.
It provides, for example, fish containing irreplaceable fatty acid, Omega-3.
They have the most abundant vegetable oil.
"To need it in the quantities needed for man, you have to drink the litres!" says dietologist.
The doctors are convinced that the inhabitants of Siberia should pay particular attention to the treatment of winter.
In this season, vegetarianism is particularly questionable.
In our circumstances, there are high requirements for food.
In order not to freeze, there is a need for increased calories.
"If a person restricts himself to animal products, then he does not choose that calorie," said a specialist.
This is in agreement with a dietologist named Olga Poznak.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruit are not an exit.
It is better to feed primarily on products grown in the region of residence or where they were born.
The genetic code is designed to improve the adoption and transformation of these products.
And the winter people don't want to be bitten, but the hot tub or something else," explains the doctor.
According to her, there may be vegans, which are actually useful for various spices, crusts, beans, local vegetables, apples left in the winter, frozen berries.
But that certainly is not enough for full - time nutrition.
According to Gastroenterologist Clavdia Ariflulin, the levels of vitamins in the organisms are sufficient only from mid-August to mid-September.
The full transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when the temperature may vary by 30 degrees per day and in May is not reasonable.
The body needs energy for life, and this is, first of all, fat," says the doctor.
Doctors note that vindictiveness is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow, they need building materials, including amino acids.
And by holding to the vegetarians, we give them to the underprivileged.
The pregnant women also need high levels of protein, vitamins and micronutrients in the menu.
"The fugitives don't like them," I'm sure God does.
Arifulina says that an adult is willing to choose whatever he likes to play in the games he wants.
He's already got the body, the skeleton, the organs.
Still, children need to be fully asked.
If parents leave him some micro-elements or amino acids, choosing what he will be, it's just a violation of the child's rights.
"The lack of any substances to develop the brain, the sight, the bones will no longer recover tomorrow," she says.
All the medical professionals surveyed reflect on the low quality of winter grown in carpets and fruit and vegetables.
What is brought to us and grown up in the carpets contains less of the micro elements we need than in the open ground.
"The quality of the products is not that," says God.
Arifulin also notes that imported and warm fruits and fruits are far from ideal standards.
At times, the desire of producers to harvest more crops is detrimental to quality.
"The apples don't become brown on the cut, the cucumbers are fast yellowing and dancing, the tomatoes are tasteless and unroasted," says medical examples, adding that they are probably consumed by an excessive amount of fertilizers.
And they become suppliers, not vitamins, but cells.
This was not agreed with by the Siberian Institute of Physics and Technology of Agri-Agrarian Problems, candidate for science by Vera Petruk.
She said that, with the right approach and compliance with all the rules and requirements in the carpets, full-fledged plants could be produced.
If they try to get out of the square meter, then, of course, they'll be more frequent, and they'll feed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too many nitrogen fertilisers are growing rapidly, they are large, but they are watertight and insatiable," she explains, adding that the quality issue, first of all, depends on the manufacturer's conscience.
The Court suspended the application of a decision on "stop-and-search" in the New York Department of Police
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal of the Federal District suspended the execution of a court order requiring changes in the “stop-and-search” programme of the New York Department of Police and removed the judge from the case.
The Court of Appeal of the Second District of the United States stated that Judge Sheindlin ' s execution would be suspended until the results of the city ' s appeal were obtained.
In August, the judge decided that the city had violated the constitution by implementing the street arrest and interrogation programme.
The city appealed to its decision and decision on corrective measures, including the requirement to appoint a controller to assist the police department in changing the practice of the work and the related training programme.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard a debate by the parties on an application for suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated the need for a judge to be taken away because she had violated the U.S. Code of Conduct and did not consider the need to avoid a demonstration of bias, partly due to a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to the court ' s criticism.
The judge decided that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, without ground addressing blacks and Latin Americans on the "stop-and-search" programme.
It appointed an external controller to monitor large changes that included policy, training and control reforms, and decided to launch a pilot programme to test video cameras on TV in police stations where most detentions occur.
In August, New York decided to cease the use of the names and addresses of people who had been arrested after the police check.
The debate on the city's appeals should be held after 14 March 2014.
The “stop and search” tactic has been criticised by a number of civil rights lawyers.
“Research” has been in practice for several decades in some form, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically with the administration of the independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 people in 2011, most of whom are black and Latin Americans.
In 2004, four people, all representatives of national minorities, filed a collective complaint.
Participants in the New York Police Department said that these changes would end unfavourable practice, create a more reliable and effective police service and may affect how other police departments were implementing this practice.
The opponents claim that changes will reduce the spirit of the police, not the level of crime, lead to unnecessary money loss and will not solve a more global problem of complex police conditions due to a reduction in officers for several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not stop the practice of “stop-and-search” which was in accordance with the Constitution, but changed the way the New York Police stopped people.
A pedestrian zone was opened in the area of the Third-Journal Gallery
A new pedestrian zone appeared in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Thirdjakov Gallery and is located two kilometres from the Novokusnecka Metro Station to Bolotna Square.
All along, street terraces, flower shops, stones, urns and toilets have been set up, and there is no such thing as a clean billboard and illegal advertising.
In addition to the Klimentov and Lavrusin Trails, which have already been pedestrians, five streets have been closed for cars, the Ordinan Stock Exchange, the Big and the Little Tolmache Passes, the Kadashev Coast and the Bolot Square.
The transport movement on the streets of Morocco and Petrovka is not limited.
On Friday, the streets from Novokusnecka Station to the Klimentov Strait have created conditions for pedestrians without removing the movement and cutting off the passage, reports newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Trinitarian Gallery, the temple of the clergy of the Pope of Rome, the museum, libraries, monuments, and other monuments.
Earlier, the entire pedestrians became the Tverk Tour, the Stolesniks via the street and the Kuzneck Bridge.
The larger Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone was opened in early September, is determined to close the exit and holiday cars.
Coulson resorted to a phone break to check the confidential message
The former editor of the newspaper News of the World Andy Coulson reportedly used the “phone break, pickup and resistance” in an attempt to confirm the false information about Charles Clark's novel, then acting as the Minister of the Interior.
The prosecutor, King's lawyer Andrew Eddies informed the court of Old Bailey that in May 2005, News of the World had received an incredible news about Clark meeting with his “attractive Special Adviser” Hanna Polby.
The newspaper ordered private detective Glenn Mulkeir to break Polby's voicemail and warn her at home to take an interview, but Coulson also called her and left her voicemail, as the court heard.
“The accusation is that Mr. Coulson, who is now editor of NotW, is not the person who will be standing next to someone’s house, hoping to keep someone busy, the person who likes to invite people’s history to see what they say,” said Mr. Eddies.
He said the newspaper News of the World used three ways of investigating the history: breaking up phones, tracking and resistance.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, about the sample, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone crash?
He says, ‘No, we say yes!’
Listening to the novel Clark for the first time drew the attention of the news of the World, when a source of sexual interest in Mrs. Polby said, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
Cassette with voicemails received from her phone at least three times was removed from the Mulkair house in August 2006.
The investigators also found records on the computer of a private detective in which Ms. Polby and her sister were depicted as “Projects”.
During the period under note, Ms. Polby ' s grandmother and grandfather received anonymous phone calls requesting information about her, Mr. Eddie said.
At that time, former chief reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Wezerap were monitoring the link between Ms. Polby's movements.
After leaving her a vote on 18 June 2005, Coulson said: “I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and which I would like to discuss very much with Charles.”
Mr. Eddie said that Coulson's participation in this story was the same as with other influential people, such as the former Minister of Internal Affairs David Blancett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had entered a confrontation with Mr. Blancett about a novel with a married woman when he himself met with the correspondent Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied contact with other people in order to break up the telephones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulkair, Turlbeck and Wezerap were admitted to a phone crash.
Snouden states that it is ready to contact the authorities of the GFR in the case of interrogation
The former CIA staff member, Edward Snowden, is willing to come to Germany as soon as he has the legal opportunity to do so, and to meet with FRG authorities, reports the RIA News.
A letter from a former CIA officer to the FRG authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin was presented on Friday by a representative of the Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebel, through which Snouden transmitted the message to the German authorities.
Shrebele had recently met Snowden in Moscow.
Four people were injured as a result of a fire on the Tver Street.
As a result of the burning in the collector's centre of Moscow, on the Tver Street, four people were injured.
As Interfax reports with reference to a source in emergency services, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, passersby were injured during the fire in a smoldering underground passage.
According to RIA News with reference to the head of Pavl Livinski's fuel-energy department, electricity is now fully restored in all homes on the Tverska street.
A fire in a heat collector near the house 15 on the Tverska Street occurred on the evening of 31 October.
There was a strong smoke from the canals, and a smoke in the underground passage at the store in Armenia.
As a result of the fires, 11 houses were destroyed on the Tver Street.
At 21:45 in Moscow time the fire was extinguished.
United States dollars cut food allowance for the poor
Food allowance for the family of four persons is reduced by $36 per month
From Friday in the United States, the financial provision of food talents known as foot-and-mouth is being reduced, as the relevant public programme is being completed.
For the food allowance, the family of four will now be allocated $36 a month less than before, official persons say.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in the financial year 2012, one-person benefit was an average of $133 per month.
Food aid costs in the United States increased to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
About 14 per cent of Americans rely on free food aid issued under the Füdstempa, which has been named since the time they had the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to encourage economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, the Republicans of Congress require further reductions in funds allocated to the programme, stating that it should be aimed at helping those who need more.
Food store owners throughout America are concerned that reductions will reduce consumer costs.
U.S. Congressmen continue to dispute how much less funding can be made available to the Government.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platform for free
The Blizzard Studio released its Blackhorn platform to PC free of charge in 1994.
That's what WoW Insider reports.
According to him, the game became available at Battle.net in the classic Blizzard game section.
However, some gamblers point out that at present only those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service can jump.
The game is still not available for Russian users.
As media reports, the version that Blizzard has now released to PC is not externally different from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to Blackthorne has also remained unchanged.
Plattform Blackthhorne, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, originally went to SNES consoles.
His events were unfolding on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
On one occasion, the dark ruler of Sarlak decided to kill the bright King Vloroz and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was saved from death by sending him to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight with Saralak's thrusters and to protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthhorn became the first game the studio released after being renamed Blizzard Entertainment.
She used to be called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthhorne was a publisher of Interplay.
New machines will appear in the Moscow metropolis.
But selling tickets to passengers will not be for money but for meetings.
A journey of 30 rubles will be conducted by a potential passenger at 30 sessions.
The number of meetings will be supported by a special device using modern technology, ITAR-TASS reports with reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first apparatus will be installed at the Eastern Station on 8 November 2013.
New tickets will be presented by the President of the Russian Olympic Committee, Alexander Zukov, and the Olympic champions Alexis Like and Elena Zamoldčikov.
The Agency ' s recognition of national security enhances the paramilitary corporation with regard to public evidence
A hot day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
Under the instructions of the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Service, its task was to photograph the roof of the United States representation building, which is less than 5 km away from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say that BfV was hoping to find antennas of listening devices, and these actions led to negotiations between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of the U.S. National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the U.S. did not use external intelligence “to steal foreign companies’ commercial secrets for American companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their income”.
But since Edward Snouden, a contract servant who became an informer, began publishing his U.S. intelligence secretary, the European governments and company leaders are no longer convinced whether the director can be trusted.
The announcements that the U.S. National Security Agency had followed the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data stored by U.S. cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, raised the paranoia of the State's flagship to new heights.
The last chapel was reported that Angela Merkel's cell phone had been interrogated for perhaps ten years.
If Europe's most influential person can be a target, then of course, it is also a potential target for business leaders.
Snouden has made clear intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies.
I think it's likely that these data are used with mutual benefit.
“Germany should wake up,” says Oliver Green, president of the BITMI Association, which represents Germany’s small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the United States is now at almost the same risk as China in the area of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the EY Consulting Agency.
In all the documents that Mr. Snouden has revealed, however, there has still been no evidence that the United States has transmitted the commercial secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU did not have some information technology and the Internet, and expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German Parliament says we need to create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not an option,” says Gasso Plattner, president of the German software supplier company for the SAP business.
If there was a need for a powerful European IT industry, it was not necessary to allow it to die more than 20 years ago.
All are subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the scope and technical development of US spy agencies, known as the Snouden revelations, were a shock to some companies who previously thought that China was the biggest risk.
There is a great deal of movement in cloud technology, where European company managers are better aware that data in the United States is in the same jurisdiction and are therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 per cent of its non-American participants refused to use the services of the US cloud provider after the US programme for intellectual analysis of Prism data was released.
Jim Snoweb, one of the executive directors of the SAP, said: “We see that consumers are asking a new question that did not arise a year ago, namely: where my data are stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction.”
Many German leaders claim that the latest messages are merely a confirmation that they already knew that powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data should be protected at any price.
What is happening is not surprising.
He always had a place.
“This has been discussed for many years and has not significantly changed in the current debate,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are also spying on them, because it is in our national interests to protect our commercial enterprises.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to be praised for the response they have taken, as this may give the enemy a benefit.
Large companies have long had the idea that taking a free flashlight on a show or leaving a laptop without a look at the hotel’s number is at least unattainable.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the Board of Directors of the Audi car construction company, said that it had been a standard practice for many years to collect mobile phones before the government meetings so that they could not be used as hearing aids.
The Federal Defence Service of Germany recommends that company managers consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign travel due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
The prepaid mobile phones are subsequently removed.
However, there is fear that small and medium-sized companies will remain vulnerable to collapses and seizures.
In Germany, many such companies are world market leaders in their specific niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access”, warns the BfV report.
The United States of America is also in the process of preventing its own economic espionage from being carried out by other countries.
In February, the U.S. National Intelligence Summary placed France with Russia and Israel in a second series of offenders who were hacking for economic intelligence, after China, approved The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, “Frenchs are worse all”.
Bernard Scarsini, former head of the French Internal Intelligence Agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: “Services know that all countries, even when working together to combat terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a young girl from Georgia who died in a “unprecedented accident” believe that their son was killed
Parents from Georgia, whose body was found inside the twisted sports mat in his high school sports hall, believe that their son was killed, said a family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from the city of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on 11 January in a vertical mammoth attached to the courts in the sports hall of his high school.
The Loundes County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old family objected.
"They are absolutely sure their son was killed," said FoxNews.com Benjamin Kramp, lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he died as the sheriff said.
“They believe that this is contrary to logic, to the laws of physics, and to sound sense,” Kramp said.
They believe that it is a cover for the protection of people or people responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with the school bag and brought him back to the body bag," he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key issues remained unanswered.
What caused death?
Was his death the result of the crime?
The Wall made a statement at the press conference on Thursday.
I'm going to study all the facts wherever they come from.
My goal is to learn the truth.
“I take the view that there are sufficient grounds” he said for formal investigation.
The Wall told reporters that the initial discovery showed that Johnson died as a result of “positional asphyxiation”.
However, the second discovery, according to Mura, showed another cause of death.
“There are several issues to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Mor added that if he found enough evidence to require a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to carry it out.
The Director of the Loundes District Sheriff was not available for comment when he was contacted on Thursday.
On Wednesday, the Judge of South Georgia ordered the authorities to publish all the video surveillance cameras that the investigators were watching.
Adolescent parents said that they hoped that the videos contained the key to their understanding of how he died.
Spartacus: For information on persons who have exposed the Fascist symbol
A statement by the Moscow Club on the appearance of a Fascist flag in Jaroslavla was made on the official Spartacus website.
On October 30, unknown provocators at a stadium in Jaroslavle demonstrated a fascist symbol.
We address all those who have reliable information on those who have committed this criminal offence, with a request to provide it
"Remuneration is guaranteed," said the statement.
Search for fanatics who have set off a fascist flag in Jaroslav
Let's remember that in the 1/16th match, the Russian Cup of Shinnik, Spartacus, was interrupted several times because of the riots in the courts.
A fascist symbol was also shown in the Spartacus patient sector.
Spartacus is punishable by about three matchrs without vision.
A meeting of the Committee will be held on Friday.
If you have any information about who has passed this symbol, please contact us.
Centres for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for schools on child allergy
In the middle of the disease control and prevention centres, a list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in children in schools was published.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the U.S. Government, while the number of school children suffering from food allergy is growing.
One of the 20 children in the United States now have food allergies.
Disease control and prevention centres found that the prevalence of food allergy among children increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide provides information for schools on how to raise awareness of teachers and staff on food allergy in children and how to assist in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep adrenaline stocks — the most commonly used for injections — with the automatic medical syringe EpiPen — to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The legislative authorities of the States have recently amended the regulation to allow schools to make adrenaline stockpiles with fewer difficulties.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children with an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "It feels like something is happening in my language," "It feels like I have a hair on my tongue" or "the tongue of a pencil."
Parents of intersexual children can choose “unspecified gender”
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third half of children born with non-intermediate sexual organs.
The male or female sex will no longer be compulsory for newborns.
The new law does not require parents to name any gender of such children, allowing parents to identify gender as “unspecified” or “unspecified” in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents who could make rapid decisions on the allocation of sex to newborns and to prevent discrimination against intersexuals.
One intersexual person, according to the BBC, said many years later: “I am not a man and not a woman”.
I'm going to be a doctor-in-law with blues and scarves.
One of the two thousand children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of some 60 pathological conditions that are diagnosed with “sexual developmental disorder”, a term of collection for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ejacs or seedlings) or unusually developed outside sex organs.
Wallis Simpson may have been an intersexual.
Gender identification has not yet been sufficiently studied, but most experts in the United States say that if gender cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and assign it than to wait and track the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if at all.
New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Dresser, who specializes in gender identification, said that the new German law “sounds like a good idea”.
Intersexual children create ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening violations that require operational intervention, but most children do not have them,” he said.
You can assign a sex without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child develops a gender identity is not too accurate.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why people are gay.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersexual persons as different from transsexual or transgender, because their status is related not to gender, but to their biological construction, which is not exclusively to male or female, but typically to both at the same time or not to one of them.
These characteristics may occur in secondary sex signs such as muscle mass, hair cover distribution, chest and body tissue; primary sex signs such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides a general picture of discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender people in the field of employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudice crimes.
Now there's a special camp for boys with gender bias.
Australia and Nepal are already allowing adults to place male, female or “third sex” in their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Norrie May Welby was the first person in the world to be recognized as a “uncertain” sex offender.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the German passports will use the third symbol in addition to M and F - X, i.e. intersexual.
In neighbouring France, gender issues still raise contradictions, according to the news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators, this prominent Catholic country, signed a petition for the removal of “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American Catholic Online website also disagreed with the German law, writing that “in a situation where the world is attracted to a new state where sex is the subject of choice, and sexual activity is not, we are turning back two more pillars of civilization”.
A mother of a newborn child from Maryland also reported to the Baby Zone website that she would prefer to have a sex at birth.
“It’s hard enough to raise a child without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she said to the parents’ website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites — in the name of a beautiful Greek god who had signs of both sexes.
And another ten years ago, the medical community viewed the gender as a letter that can be drawn and then painted again.
But many are now questioning the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and that the doctor sometimes makes a false choice, not knowing how a child will perceive the gender he is given when he grows up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called "an emergency psychiatric case," Dresser said.
When such children were born, you did not call a psychiatrist — you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermittent genitalia was suggested by Dr. John Mani of John Hopkins University, who believed that the gender was easy to change.
He introduced the term “general identity” and claimed that signs of the environment, including social, as parents grow the child, interact with the genes and hormones of the child, determining whether a person would be considered a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/John, his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been damaged during a non-slip cut, to cast the child fully, also to remove his eggs, and to grow him as a girl.
“Mani presented the case as a successful example of transition, but it was not so,” Dresser said.
When the boy was about 15, he again became a boy and married a woman.
But at 38 years of age, he committed suicide.
Dreser said that some doctors are still “applying this model”.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the survivors of these sex-exchange operations declared themselves “unsatisfaction”.
That was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes, but with genitals of an intermediate type.
The doctor could not determine exactly whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and was convinced that he would never be able to live a man’s “full life”.
Therefore, soon after his birth in 1976, the outside sex organ and Bruce’s eggs were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At 18 years of age, he was given vaginal plastics.
But when he was depressed and realized that something was wrong, he needed medical documentation.
What he knew was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and nobody ever told me about it.
Bruce was born in violation of sexual development, which did not allow his body to produce enough testosterone for normal genital development.
When he learned the truth, he again became a man, receiving testosterone rings and removing his chest.
The operation made it fruitless.
Today, he advocates the protection of others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to bring into line the perception of people with intersexuality.
But Ann Temar-Mattis, Executive Director of the California Law Association Lawyers for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law “stimulates the application of the labels and stigma”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give the child an “unspecified sex”, she said.
We're afraid he'll be promoting intervention.
We think it's best to assign a male or female sex and then wait.
But we haven't seen this law come to light yet, so all we can do is build assumptions.
Temar Mattis said that her organization supported the Australian law because “it allows adults to make choices in favour of the third sex”.
“Adolescents should be able to make their own decisions on formal sexuality,” she says.
The German law meant her birth.
This is a fight that small children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlin Barac, a Pittsburgh Mommologist, who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law “supports” both parents and children.
The daughter of Barac, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development disorder called “androgenic insensitivity syndrome”.
Since her androgen receptors are working incorrectly, Katy has developed female signs.
She's got a place to go, but she doesn't have mothers and eggs.
Now, at 29 years of age, Katie is getting married and is going through an Ordinance on Child Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite being barren, she hoped to become a parent through adoption or gestured surrogate motherhood.
"The law gives parents time to avoid making hasty decisions themselves," Barac said.
It gives them time to do some analysis and to deal with the situation, as well as the time period before they write “male” or “female”.
In that case you will grow up, love the child.
You have a wonderful child, and you have joy.
We don't have to do an operation that can't be reversed.
“This allows children to take part in the decision and eliminate the anxiety that is driving their parents because they do not feel what they are doing right,” she said.
At the end of the day, the child will decide which sex he or she is comfortable with — and that is remarkable.
This enables children to make decisions on their own.
"Chicago" Gatekeeper Nikolai Habibulin stressed that he understands that he should play better.
According to a 40-year-old rosian, he will continue to work hard at training.
In the last two "Jestrebov" meetings, Habibulin first missed six matches from Tampa Bay and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth one.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I haven't been able to do this, CSNChicago says Habibulin.
- I need to find confidence in training, I think, to approach them as a game, and to try to achieve a better outcome.
You must study your past games and work on the shortcomings that have been.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but I feel pretty good at training.
But why, after a few heads, it's all turning into a snowcomme.
Maybe I need to relax a little bit.
Gatekeepers, I don't think I'm the only one that's always trying to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not in a hurry.
It doesn't matter what happens in front of my doors.
I'm still working on myself so I don't miss so much soap.
It's great that my roommates support, but in principle, it's just, I have to play better.
Two games is not the whole season, but I wanted to do them a lot better.
But it happened.
I have to put this on the side.
I'm just gonna try and play the next match better.

Medvedev estimates that the SSJ-100 aircraft will be deployed to Europe
Russia estimates that once the Latin American and Asian markets are established, Superjet 100 aircraft will be delivered to Europe as well.
"We expect that, in general, we will have more than 170 aircraft copies of this type of aircraft," says Prime Minister Dmitria Medvedev of Russia, quoted at the press conferences with French Prime Minister Jean Mark Eiro.
The head of the Russian Government noted that there was serious cooperation with French colleagues, as this was a joint project.
We have today discussed some financial issues related to insurance, but we hope that once this aircraft is strengthened in the Latin American markets and in the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be provided to our partners in Europe.
"I hope he will ever be placed in France," stressed the Russian Prime Minister.
SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by the City of Suhogo in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
Liner is developed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high quality and comfort standards in the 100 passenger seats segment.
Dneproperty Energy began a unique program to save... the nest of the aristocrats
In an old age to bring to the court of the astutes, the village on the high pillar set up wheels from the telegram, and the heavy nest was well held on it.
Such special resistance has long been abandoned, and the Aztecs have been embellishing the columns of the electric transmissions - the wires are wired, which makes the Estonian home secure.
Ania’s grandmother, near her home in the village of Ivanovka of Petikovsky, has been living an authentic family for 20 years, has noticed the nest sitting in spite of all the efforts of her inhabitants.
Birds are putting new vets on top, and the lower layer is already in the middle of the line, and that's what's going on.
Of course, it's sad to the family of atheists who have been nested in the yard every year, taken off and fed for the summer by three or four birds, but they don't want to be left without light.
As soon as the birds flew to the warmest part of the world, Grandma Anya called in the Royal REC, which has the support.
And I didn't even expect them to react so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still holding, as technical director of the DTEK "Dneprooblenergo" Sergei Berzesovski told them.
In fact, in the course of the 150 - to 200 - pound [150 - 200 kg] nest, corrosion began.
At any point, the birds could be killed by an electric range.
Yes, locals were at risk of losing their lives because of damage to the pipelines.
The linear monters have therefore begun a nest rescue operation, which is not the first time in our practice.
Research ornithologists from the National University of Dnepropetrov who have developed a nest transfer scheme have helped.
They did training for district network staff.
A well-known dnepropertivo ornithologist, Alexander Ponomarenko, advised energy users at all stages of nest reconstruction.
To begin with, it was estimated that there were more than 50 Estonian “quarters” in the emergency area.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms had been created that would remind them of the furnace.
The foundation was laid with oak blossoms, and then the old nest was moved there.
According to legends, it is enough to lay the old calves as a foundation for the birds to know the nest and return to it.
Then the ashtrays build their own homes.
A month ago, the first nest was rebuilt in the village of Peschank of Novomovski.
A number of electricians set up a new railway pillar and placed on it a platform with an old nest already inhabited.
The whole operation was carried out by the energy companies in nine thousand griffins.
And in the days of the same new village, Ivanovk of the Petrikov district was in the Ani grandmother’s yard.
The platform was fixed here in the former location, only to be mounted above the lines.
Ornithologists are convinced that careful, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their "quarters" have undergone capital repairs.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction is expected for four more nests in the Pokrovska and Carican districts of Dnepropertovrica.
In fact, while some rescue rare birds, others unforgivably kill them.
During the days, the entire area was filled with sad news - in the village of Ust-Camenka of the Apostolic Region, on the day of the opening of the hunt for the pheasants, the bridesmaids were shot by the lion family, who lived on the local plain for fun.
The blessed birds were not afraid of the people; the locals fed them, and did not grieve.
When the peasants heard the shots, they fled to the mud, four beautiful lebes were already lying on the water.
The Apostolic Paradise officers of the militia now discover who shot the birds in the Red book.
"Russian March" becomes more popular
On 4 November, on the Day of People's Unity, the Russian March will be agreed upon in Moscow.
According to the Lewada Centre survey, support for Russian Marches is growing, with 40 per cent of the population having different ideas.
According to Levada-Central data, 40 per cent of citizens have different approvals for Russian marches: 11 per cent of them are definitely positive and 29 per cent are "faster positive".
The popularity of the Russian March is growing, with only 14 per cent of Russians being welcomed in 2006 and twice as many citizens (28 per cent) were supported in December 2010.
“Determiningly negative” to “Russian March” is only 7 per cent of Russians, “early negative” is 19 per cent.
A further 35 per cent had not been able to shape their attitude towards this action.
This year, the Moscow Mary agreed to hold the Russian March, with up to 15,000 people in Ljubljana, today the head of the security department of the capital of Alexey Majorov reported.
This action of the nationalists takes place each year on the Day of People's Unity since 2005.
On the question of sociologists "Did you hear that on 4 November Russian marches were held under slogans to protect Russian rights in Russia?" three quarters (75%) of the citizens replied negatively.
Only one fifth of the Russians (20 per cent) know about this action.
Significantly, almost three thirds of Russian marches were heard in December 2010 (31 per cent).
Let us recall that three years ago, on 11 December, a nationalist natural meeting had taken place in the Manageza Square, which had become a mass disorder.
"Levada Centre" also asked the Russians what holiday was to be observed on 4 November.
In two years, the number of people who knew the right answer (Day of People's Unity) increased from 41 per cent to 49 per cent.
On the other hand, only 15 per cent of citizens are required to celebrate the holiday.
Almost as many (17 per cent) are planned to celebrate the October 7th Day of the Revolution.
Most citizens (62%) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
As the Moscow Mary agreed on "Russian March" in Ljubljana
On 28 October, the chairmen agreed to hold the Russian March in Ljubljana on 4 November.
The leader of the Russian Association, the organizer of the Dmitry Demoškin, announced this.
In addition to the sixth in Ljubljana, a meeting and a rock concert of the Colorado Group will be held on Day of People's Unity, also agreed with the authorities.
How Russia March 2012 went
In the Day of People's Unity in 2012, the nationalists passed the sixth from the Yakman Coast to the Central House of the artist where the meeting took place.
The organizers assessed the number of participants in 20,000, the MDG called the figure 6,000.
Communication: Obama pre-election headquarters considered the Banden exception for Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, the closest advisors to President Barack Obama were secretly considering replacing Vice-President Joe Baiden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election list.
This opening is the brightest sensation of all the expected book Mark Galperin and John Haylemann's 2012 campaign "The Posts Double: The Game Has Changed 2012".
The Times received a copy of the book ready to go out and reported on Thursday evening that the next president's assistants had conducted “mass studies in focus groups and public opinion polls at the end of 2011” to assess whether the Bayden exception could help to raise the hope of re-election of Obama.
According to political observer The Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the attempt by senior election officials and the White House, namely the former head of the White House Administration Bill Daily, to assess the impact of the vote on the appointment of former Secretary-General Clinton as Vice-President.
A possible replacement was a secret, carefully guarded in the Chicago Pre-election Office and in the Oval Office.
Only six of the president’s closest advisers — including Dale, the former head of Obama Jim Messin’s polling station, and the former senior advisers of the White House, David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew that the replacement was being considered.
The book Posts Double says that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Baiden, despite their “close personal relationships”, but eventually rejected this step when their data showed that Clinton’s addition to the electoral list would not “make Obama’s chances much better”.
In an interview with Martin Daily, he confirmed that the Administration had indeed considered the possibility of replacing Byden Clinton.
“I was actively talking about a lot of things, and that was one of them,” Daley said.
You must remember that the president was in a terrible shape at the time, so we thought, "Oh, God, what are we supposed to do?"
Although Daily described the study as a “necessary check”, Martin told CNN Anderson Cooper that the pre-election staff had invested enough in examining whether this step would bring dividends to the vote.
“The polling stations do not spend such amounts of money on surveys and focus groups unless they consider something serious,” Martin said in AK 360.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team had studied the possibility of replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss knew about a possible transfer.
Although Dale said that he did not think that the president had been in the course of a possible replacement, the former head of the administration acknowledged that he was “possible”, Obama knew.
Martin added that the Double Positions did not provide a clear answer to the question of whether the results of political sensitization had come to Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously believed that Obama did not know about the study of the possibility of removing Baiden from the electoral list.
"Possible," said Martin.
Do you want the light in the cold darkness?
The British entrepreneur created the world's first ice-cream in the dark by means of a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of the marine animal to develop a luminous food.
He came up with this idea by reading a scientific article on the media, and convinced scientists in China to chemically reinvigorate the glowing white.
The frozen person reacts with the language of the person who eats it, increasing the pH in the white and causing it to shine.
Chris says that since ice cream starts to light up when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, it means that the more you lie, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream production company, "Shine me, I'm delicious," says, "This is an incredible thing, but still at the very beginning, if you talk about production, you'll get about 2 g of substance for £200."
White, which we use in ice cream, will react with your language in a neutral pH.
So when your mouth burns the protein, it will increase your pH and the frozen will start to light.
We tested it over the past few months, and it seemed that it would be ideal to present it in Halloween, because it creates such a remarkable glowing effect.
This may be the dearest thing I've ever done, because the medusa luminescence is four times the value of gold.
So every spoon is worth me about £140.
That's why it's nice to taste.
Charlie's experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and the taste of social gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, “I want to develop the invisible frozen.”
It's impossible to define because of the ice crystals that make it frozen, but I think we'll find a way to do that.
The frozen uses fluorescent properties of medusa, synthesised by Chinese scientists
Coach Avangarda Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking of the preparation of his team for the match of regular champion KHL against Salavata, noted that the omits conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat of the Magnetogorian Metallurgy.
The specialist stressed that Avangardu needs to pay greater attention to the defence.
We've seen a video match against the "Metallurgy" of the Magnitude, the official website of the "Avangarda" of Chebaturkin.
- They missed a lot of shibs, not a very nice moment.
They missed out on their mistakes, due to the failure of the game.
We knew the rival had executives.
According to the statistics, they had five attacks on us, three of them killed us.
It's a very good achievement.
Have these mistakes been taken into account in preparation for today's game?
We're with the guys every match, we're talking after the game, we're ready for a new rival.
The main thing is for the installation to be completed.
Everyone saw the first match against "Metallurgy."
The game was done, and the account was 2:0.
They missed the target in the split, and in the third period they started to make a mistake.
Considering how difficult the game was, he did not see the point of joining the defenders.
Defend the whole team.
Now Avangarda has a long home series, the match goes through the day, and the team is tired?
All teams are in the same conditions.
The main focus is on the performance of its moments and the performance of the game.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you run the facility, it's not that complicated.
As a result of the new regulations introduced by the Russian Customs, hundreds of furs have been on the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today, Danish officials have promised to provide drinking water and biotowels
Hundreds of fur were buried at border crossings when entering Russia.
This situation was caused by changes in customs regulations.
Ukrainian border officials and customs officials affirm that the Russian side, which had not previously warned of the innovations, is being set up.
Since 28 October, the Russian customs authorities have applied additional measures to ensure the delivery of goods, as reported by the Deputy Chief of the Eastern Customs Office of Vladimir Denisov.
The new model document applies to countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
The missed points are working in a stronger way.
The FACTOV correspondent was on the border with the hostages in the situation.
The prices in the coffee travel shop at the "Novozavsk" drop point are growing every day, as is the case with fur.
The miners are standing in several rows, growing about two kilometers [2 km].
The Customs Terminal Novozazovsk - Veselo-Vosnek provides one of the most important transport routes from the south of Ukraine on the international highway.
From here, goods are sent to the Stavropolska border of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday before midnight, the rules were released, and then they were introduced. Alexie Golovanov, a complainant, complained about the transit through Russia of cargo from Turkey to Kazakhstan and had been in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and payment of the cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the cargo and the distance to which it is carried.
Minimum insurance is 4.5 to 5,000 rubles (about 1100 to 1300 mushrooms).
Those who go near (i.e., Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo worth up to $50,000 pay around 15,000 rubles (3800 gries) and travel.
And the rest of them, they've got no money like that.
Imagine if the driver is carrying a cargo of all four thousand dollars, but even in Moscow, he needs 90 thousand rubles (about 23,000 griffins) to pay for the transit!
The conditions for survival on the border - none - are mentioned by the roadkeepers who are standing by their cars.
In border stores and cafes and as expensive as ever, but prices like here, we haven't met anywhere!
The sellers went straight ahead, and they were quickly driven: 15 griffin stands, 7 griffins, coffee jars, 25 griffins, soup trays.
And the coffee shop alone.
And there's no toilet.
We're sleeping in the stairs, and we're going to the bathroom.
Don't wash or take care of...
I can't get out of the car for a week, my wife made it all up.
A week ago, Victor Scotarenko's another great-great-grandfather.
Is my car just coming in next week?
Why do you have half a litre of water?
There's 11 and 15 mushrooms.
What, a bottle of crystal, or a silver cup?
We have coffee, not a store.
Take as long as there's anything else, it's a salesman.
After the situation began to be reported in the media, Ukrainian leaders drew the attention of the region ' s authorities to the plight of the situation.
The management of the Amurosian and Novozasov Paradise Administrations has been commissioned to ensure that all those who stand in line at the Ukrainian-Russian border with drinking water have the responsibility of President Sergei Dergunov.
The emergency brigades are now underway at the points of departure.
Bio-towels will also be installed for the convenience of people.
According to the official, the problem of lineage will be resolved in the coming days.
According to the press service, 32 and 68 cars were used respectively at the international crossing points of Ospenka and Novozavsk, as at 31 October.
“FACTS” will monitor developments.
Vilnius suspects Moscow trying to challenge the Lithuanian President
Russia intends to implement information provocations against the high-ranking Lithuanian and Eastern Partnership countries, such a statement made by BNS in the Republic's Security Department (PGI).
Information on this is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to “speak” of Lithuania's President Dalu Grybauskait and to publish falsified documents, allegedly found in Russia's Gosarhive, which relate to the facts of the Lithuanian leader's biography.
According to the Special Service, the Department of Public Management of the Russian Presidential Administration on Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries is preparing an information attack.
The structure is headed by Evgenie Umerenkov, a visit to Lithuania and a meeting of the Lithuanian People's Party.
The operation is also reportedly a member of Department B. Smirnov.
According to the Special Service, before the end of 2012, Smirnov regularly visited Lithuania and contacted local politicians, politicians and media representatives.
Smyrna is now banned from entering the territory of the country.
Recently, the President of Lithuania Grybauskait stated that he knew about the information being prepared for her.
In her view, Lithuania's successful presidency in the Council of the European Union and “the country's ambition for energy independence” was the main reason.
The Lithuanian leader had previously not unanimously criticised the actions of the Russian authorities.
So she said that in Kremlin, Lithuania was "not respected enough."
In addition, Gribauskait accused RF Vladimir Putin of "one requirement".
Remember, in September, Rossustzauzer suspended the import of Lithuanian "milk" into Russia.
The quality of the product was reported to be inconsistent with the health and epidemiological standards.
At that time, Lithuania's leader stated that if Russia did not take the ban, the Government should prepare for WTO.
In the United States, the principal of the school shot teenagers.
The director of one of the American secondary schools literally led to despair.
The man, he said, had to take the gun and start shooting.
The incident happened in Tennessee.
According to New York Post, minor hooligans have left the house with a toilet paper.
As a result, the principal of the school opened a shooting at the adolescents, resulting in several injuries in his leg and arm, which resulted in a 15-year-old boy.
Since the hooligans were not in the territory of the director ' s property, he was accused of assaulting under aggravating circumstances.
The man was released from prison in a deposit of $125.000.
It is noted that shooting in the United States of America is becoming a horrendous rule of law.
A man literally opened a shooting at the center of the town of Rijcrest in California, U.S.A., right on the street.
The criminal then seized the hostages of two random passengers, hid them in the trunk of the car, and tried to hide.
Earlier in Newtown City School, Connecticut State, a shooting was opened.
At school, my mother, Adama, worked as a teacher.
Shooting at American school: injured 14-year-old girl
A major shooting incident occurred on 31 January at the American school, this time in Annalanta, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
Our sister and I were allowed to have confetti, not to sleep late and to fix the mascara for our area.
I'm more like a snitch now.
I haven't called in the last two years to distribute confetti in my apartment and I'm probably not gonna be here this year.
But statistics show that I'm a white crow in Halloween.
According to the National Federation of Different Trade, the majority of Americans, namely 158 million, will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion in confetti, costumes and decorations.
The only thing I'm waiting for every Halloween is a trend.
The National Federation of Different Trade predicts that $1.2 billion will be spent on costumes of $6.9 billion.
This year, in fashion, sexual distasteful objects.
Women are no longer required to represent sexual professions; they can also be a sexual food such as pizzas, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I think we'll see a lot of zombies through the Walking Dead, and I'm sure that the Daft Punk group-style cosmonauts will fall into our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
Please, there's nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We ordered our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we were not alone.
Moreover, according to the National Federation of Diverging Trade, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year.
That means a lot of funny dog dogs.
When it comes to confiscating, we don't hesitate.
The Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolate, ice cream, Milk Duds Confectionery, Twizzlers Confectionery and Clark Bar Batons.
According to the U.S. Ministry of Trade, this is a great news for 41 million demanding confetti of children who are prepared to submit to our areas.
Moreover, we will buy and, if we do not cheat, consume 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is the confectionery in the form of corn grains; and yet, according to the National Condition Association, nearly 35 million pounds are sold under Halloween.
It's about 9 billion individual maize seeds.
It's a mystery I still have to think about.
There's nothing like Halloween, like a house with ghosts.
They have amazing names, such as “Hour behind the walls” (which, by the way, is in this prison), “You and yell” and “The House of Shock”.
Moreover, according to the American Haunts society, there are 1,200 officially recognized homes that generate about $500 million of income, as well as those amazing photos where you've described almost what your friend put on Facebook, and you can't get rid of, and then the guy you like sees this photo and leaves a comment like a “classic expression of person”.
And finally, we'll talk about the kind.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Ticwa when we were kids, and the cutting off of Jack's flashlight is like the decoration of a Christmas tree, what we do from childhood.
Luckily for us, the fashion of the baby started only last year with Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting these, not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Population Census Bureau, this year the Americans will spend around $106 million in livestock.
Jack's lighthouse, slowly drying on your wing, probably came from Illinois, which grew 542 million pounds this year.
If you want a more complicated assignment, call Tim and Susan Metisdon in the city of Napa, California, and try to cut some of their weight by 2032 pounds.
Estonia's Mine Defense Site Re-established After Ukrainian Hackers Attack
The website of the Ministry of Defence of Estonia is restored after the morning of cyberattack, reports the department's press service.
According to the Vice-Chairman of Minor's Information and Administrative Affairs, timer Petercop was a primitive attack, and the site was simply overloaded by a large number of requests.
Our specialists have quickly done everything, the site has been restored to date.
"The damage caused to the Ministry is minimal," Petercop told Postimees.
According to Peter, it is early on to talk about who organized the attacks.
"We must examine the causes of the incident and draw our conclusions, but it is impossible to prevent such incidents completely," he admitted.
In addition, on 1 November, the Anonymous Ukraine set up a network to confirm the hacker attack on the Estonian Defence site and protested against the Ukraine and NATO partnership.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We shouldn't be NATO's servants.
The Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine doesn't need NATO block.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine doesn't need Russia either.
Ukraine must not be a slave.
We are in favour of independent Ukraine.
"Hands other than Ukraine," says Anonymous.
Formerly, the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine reported that the mouth of the Sea Pechots of the Feodosian individual battalion of the Ukrainian Sea Pechots will participate in NATO Steadfast Jazz-2013 command-step studies.
Several schools and hospitals had to be closed because of the violence
Four schools in the Zimbabwen province of South Matabeleland had to be closed because the students were attacked... by goblins.
As the local elder explained, the children panicked and continued their activities became impossible.
The story of goblins may sound like a child's invention for a European, but in Africa this is a very serious argument for closing school.
Adults are also afraid of unclean forces.
In the summer, for example, the hospital in Zimbabwe was closed because the hospital was also attacked by goblins.
Announced Land Rover
Inside there are slot seats and six-dimensional safety belts, as well as the internal communications system.
Modernized brakes, a service package that provides access to Bowler Works machines, logistical support and car storage between activities can also be obtained.
Drew Bowler, director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The participants in the Bowler rally have changed.”
Some of them are not experienced hunters, but people who are looking for concerns, adventures and access to world-class activities.
We are pleased to propose such a way in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to try different disciplines of the rails in Britain and abroad, as well as to prepare participants to the difficult conditions and realities of the rails.
We were delighted to develop the Defender Challenge car — it would be a really exciting championship.
Defender Challenge also provides for one day in February for training and testing, as well as for participation in desert activities in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian forces are not aware of the "British Circle" group - New Reports
INTERFAX.RU writes about this with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement authorities of the RF.
"After media reports of the introduction by the US Ministry of Finance of Leps into the suspect checklists of the Eurasian criminal union 'British Circle ' have been made available, we have reviewed all databases, but we have not found such a grouping," said the interviewer.
In his view, the dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which is allegedly operating abroad.
As noted earlier, yesterday, the US Ministry of Finance published on its website a list of alleged members of the "Bratian Circle" criminal group.
Among them was the Russian singer Gregory Leps.
He's on the list as Grisha, and he's on the list.
They match the data of the popular Russian executive.
The exact name is Grigorio Lepsevride, the creative pseudonym, the place and date of birth.
Besides Leps, there are five other people mentioned there.
Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, a Uzbek citizen and another former USSR member whose nationality is not indicated.
The United States is convinced that Gregory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, has transported money to gangs on their orders.
This communication includes a photograph of the singer and all his data that are valid.
Moreover, Leps actually recently bought a house on Phukete.
The Committee noted that they intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
The introduction of a person to the American Minfin blacklist entails blocking his assets in the United States and prohibiting business contacts with individuals living in the United States.
Assistant Leps Maja Serikov stated that no notifications to the singer had been received: “It is difficult to answer the question whether it is the Grigory that everyone is talking about now in connection with the scandal in the United States.”
All Leps knows is the news of the media.
He had no personal information, although I do not know whether they were in such cases.
"And, of course, that's all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other -- amazing and unexpected," she said to RIA News.
According to her, Phukette Gregory Leps does not live, but, according to Minfin, he has a home on the Thai island.
She said that Leps was now on a long journey to the Far East and Siberia, and that news had left him in the city of Blagoveschensk.
The winner of the "Shinnik" match.
Some details have been made known about the identity of the fanatic who escaped in the field during the 1/16th match of the Russian Cup between the Jaroslav "Skinnik" and the Moscow "Spartak".
According to the head of the CDC, Artur Grigoryanz, referring to the MDDs, the patient is a mosquito.
He's under arrest right now.
"For this reason, the Grygorian told us how the fanatic was able to break into the field: "It was revealed that this, called his visionary, was soon helped to accompany two viewers, referring to problems with the heart.
He came to the emergency room, and this was confirmed by the doctor shortly.
Then he pushed two of his companions and fled to the field.
He fled from the east and south corner to the north corner.
He ran all over the field.
That's what the stewards are responsible for.
Prior to the entry into force of the Sports Act, this is the area of action of the drivers - the police cannot interfere with what is on the field.
He ran to the court, passed through the Eastern court.
At that time, riots began at the Eastern Tribunal and on the runaway roads," the head of the CDC said.
Recall that with the decision of the KDK, the Moscow Spartak will carry out the upcoming 15th round of the Russian Championship against Locomotiva and Zenita without vision, and will pay a fine of 600 thousand rubles.
Fire teams were called to rescue the lost puppy, which stuck 50 feet above ground in a dangerous career.
Koker-Spanish Ruby escaped after falling into a small DTP
Three days later, her career career was marked by a man who was riding a dog.
The firemen came down on the rope on the shoulder to save the dog from the imminent death
He was lucky to be saved after the fire squads were fired to pick him up and deliver him to a safe place, after he somehow stuck 50 feet high on a dangerous slope.
The nine-month-old Koker-Spanie Ruby escaped after a car accident on Sunday, and spent three days alone before she was rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Her landlord, 25-year-old Scott Alderson, and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were in Fleppit's career in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to join Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They were eager to search for their missing dog and placed treatment on social media sites after she ran away from her career after a small accident.
At about 14:15 in the middle of the star doghouse, Ruby noticed a 50-foot stop in the career.
The Klekhiton fire rescue team rushed to the scene, landed on the ropes to save Ruby, and used the conveyor to lift it up on the slope.
Rescue Officer Andy Clayton said she was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the hanging curtain — 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move a muscle when she was saving, she stood up.
But now she's fine.
Then she ate the oven.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog has noticed is incredible.
The rescue officer Peter Lau said, "Ruby's been very lucky to have saved her."
It was likely that she could have had a very serious injury or worse.
The rubies were taken to the vet for inspection, and it was found that everything was fine with it, except for decommissioning and decommissioning.
Mrs. Hall of Galifaxa, West Yorkshire, said: “Watching the rescue was terrible”.
I couldn't believe she was there at all.
It was amazing when she came back into our hands.
The veterinarian said that if she hung up and lost consciousness, she would probably fall.
The fires were magnificent.
That was very brave — what they did.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson from Kitley added, "We were afraid that she might fall, but she stayed there."
The fires were amazing.
I just can't believe she showed up there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't play with Katie Perry when she was 18.
During an interview with the Australian radio show this week, the pop-star said that she was a beck-vocalist for Jagger's 2004 Old Habits Die Hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a veteran rocker, and she said, “He was playing with me when I was 18 years old.”
She added, "That was a long time ago, and he was very good."
In a statement on Thursday, a seven-year-old representative of Jagger said that he “categorically denied that he had ever given up on Katie Perry.”
He added: "It may be that she is traveling with someone else."
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted in the first place this week.
George Kerewan: Breaking Europe gives Scottish people a choice
Another day, another fear of independence.
This time we are warned that independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European area of free movement as a condition of EU membership.
There is a history of passport control in Bervik and the border with a rolling line along Adrianov wa.
True, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed out the potential economic benefits of more free movement across the rest of Europe, although, as predicted, this did not appear in the headlines.
No one has indicated that EU Member States are spending a lot of time reversing their formal rules as comfortable as possible.
Since Scotland is not now part of the Schengen area, the continuation of non-compliance with the requirements will be a cheap replacement for Brussels in exchange for what it really wanted from the Scottishs.
So it's not worth the attention of history.
And so old that she turned into a rock: for the first time, I heard the “outbreak” that “independence means passport control”, at least 40 years ago.
And yet there's an interesting moment lost in telling the old story.
Why should Scotland, an independent one, comply with Europe's orders?
Why change London's Yard to Brussels Yard, especially now?
This is the current European news: a major post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stopped.
With the European crisis, the European project is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, the anti-EU or euro-denominated parties are gaining power.
Even in Germany, the European Party of Alternatives for Germany, founded only this year, came out of nichtoud and received nearly five million votes in the September federal elections, thus essentially removing the Free Democrats (like our Liberal Democrats) from Budapest.
There has always been an internal opposition to the federal plan for Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The harsh economic measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the challenges imposed on national economies by the maintenance of a single currency led many people to believe that the European project was too far away.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments working with excessive budget deficits, which was only fair for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members in exchange courses that benefit German exporters, which are German policies and want to preserve.
Without the possibility of devaluing the national currency, South Europe is facing an unfavourable situation in terms of production opportunities compared to Germany.
The only means of saving is to cut salaries and public expenditures, which is actively supported by Berlin.
The current problems of the budget and the currency are the deeper problem of Europe's productive capacities.
As a result of the "green" energy package implemented by Brussels, the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as for gas by French and German energy companies from the consumer.
It's a paralyzing price conditions, as we've seen in Greensmouth.
No freezes of wages in the world will stop the devastating victory of US cheap salt gas over the European oil industry.
As a result, there has been a rebellion, especially in France, once the most violent side of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU a way to control Germany and put Paris at one level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of obtaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the ruined economy of France in a dire situation.
The result is the rights against the EU party, Marin Le Pen National Front, just won the decisive additional elections by throwing the ruling socialist party to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent votes, a timely warning to the British Laborists that there is no reason to assume that the division of the right will automatically benefit the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly acquired popularity among the French white working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and the single currency.
If — and this is very likely — the EU party will receive support in these elections, such a block will be able to take the dominant position in the European Parliament for the first time.
This is my opinion: the rapidly growing attitudes against the EU and against the single currency in Europe are being brought together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become something of a floating “Europe (the sovereign nations)” that liked General de Goll.
Germany and several economies can preserve the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I assume that Britain is far from this project, hoping to get closer to the United States.
Nevertheless, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will remain unattainable in the Atlantic cold.
How does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (in fact) of Little England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to achieve a more freer European agreement, provided that we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other single countries will be easier in the non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of repeating the experience of Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The Government of the Scottish National Party in Scotland is, as it may be, the most successful political movement in Europe aimed at countering the harsh economic measures of the vast majority of votes in 2011 due to objections to the reduction of the costs proposed (and implemented) by the Labour Office by Alister Darling and subsequently by the coalition of the parties and liberal democracies.
Scotland would now not be able to vote in favour of independence only in order to take action against the harsh economies imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early sex creation: Ageing Before
African American and Latin American girls usually reach sexual maturity earlier than their white peaks, showing research.
Physical changes do not mean that sex is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the early-mortgage mechanisms
The tendency to early sexual maturity is not so much expressed in boys
Former correspondent CNN Pet Et Eterjeg is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be afraid if her daughter begins to develop the beginnings of breast iron and develop lobe hair at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, child endocrinologist Paul Caplovitz explained that these early physical changes were quite common among American girls and constituted a new rule.
“I spend a lot of time calming my parents — this usually doesn’t mean a rapid onset of full sexual maturity,” said Kaplovic.
The obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, lobes, and mucous membranes, and the smell of the body, appear earlier in girls.
But there was only a small shift in the age of menarche (first period) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and falls from 12.75 in 1970.
“After the breast begins to develop, it takes at least two or three years to menarche,” said Caplovitz, who is also the author of the book “Raining sex in girls: how to cope with this widespread problem”.
Time is the most accurate check on how sex creation will progress.
A discussion is held that it is the actual onset of sexual maturity, but it is considered “preliminary” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a sharp increase of up to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will be slowed down or suspended, which is what a pediatrician can monitor carefully.
More rapid progress can serve as a basis for analysis of endocrinology to eliminate serious problems such as swelling or cough.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature bone aging, which can eventually slow down growth and slow down growth in mature age.
The recommendations for therapeutic or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the level of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychiatric aspects are also important.
The caplovitz is careful with medications, but recognizes that “extension of sex can alleviate the behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they are different from vertebrates”.
Another major problem is that parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstrual periods.
“They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or even about how they deal with health issues,” said Kaplovic.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter started menstruating at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we were talking about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school frightened and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are many unannounced theories about the causes of early sexual mutilation.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foodstuffs, chemicals in the environment or sexual media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, have sexual intercourse earlier.
Capowitz claims that the most important requirement is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, it helped to conduct a study of girls between 6 and 9 years of age, which links the amount of fat in the body to the duration of sexual mutilation.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In that country, African American and Latin American girls usually reach sexual maturity earlier than their white vertebrae.
There are different explanations.
Throughout the world, premarital sex seems to have an impact on everything, from economic conditions and climate to genes.
A further mystery: Although boys have hair on their face and on their skulls at a younger age, the tendency toward early sexual intercourse is not as strong as that of girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of this topic.
The appearance of the next and the lobby hair even occurs among infants and children of a great age.
“We must be careful about how we determine the true onset of sexual maturity,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, child endocrinologist at the Gorieb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from the pediatrician about how to talk to their child.
“This may mean earlier than expected, conversation,” said Kaplovic.
If you remain calm, your child usually reacts well.
Girls who thrive early need to confirm that even when this is done earlier, this process is a normal part of life.
In China, American Boeing prepares for a flight
The observation flights conducted under the Open Sky Treaty over the territory of Russia and the unplanned landing of an American aircraft in Chita on Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 p.m., will leave the city at the time of Moscow.
The airport's management allowed the ship to fly, getting the fuel money.
As reported at the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan-Ude.
According to other data, he will be sent to the United States.
It was reported that the plane flying in Ulan-Ude landed in the Zabaykali land due to the fog.
He was not released from the Chita airport due to unpaid bills.
There are 30 persons aboard the aircraft, including the crew, who spent two nights at the airport, reports ITAR-TASS.
As reported in the IDF, under the conditions of the Open Sky Treaty, people on board the aircraft do not have the right to exit from the Chita airport, they may only be subject to border control at two Russian airports, in Cuba and in Ulan-Ude.
An open-air treaty was signed in 1992, with 34 States participating in it.
Monitoring flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are the development of transparency, the monitoring of arms control agreements, the empowerment of crisis prevention and crisis resolution in the framework of OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do I.K.'s late reputations earn in the U.S.
The rating of living celebrities with the highest income in 2013 led Madonna to earn $125 million.
But her deceased Michael Jackson, whose death income from October 2012 to October 2013, amounted to 160 million.
It is notable that other celebrities who had “worked” a few times less in the past year have gone out of their way.
The second was in the list of the most “consisting” flags produced by Forbes magazine following the year, Elvis Presley was 55 million per year, and the following was the author of the 37 million Peanuts Charles Schultz comics.
In addition, Elizabeth Taylor, the former leader (25 million) and musician Bob Marley (18 million) entered the first Friday.
The list also includes Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein.
In Moscow, the first bottle of Igoria Gulaeva was opened.
On 23 October, the first flagship of Igor Goljaev was opened in Moscow.
Designer Igori Guljav is famous for its magnificent luxury mecha.
And now they'll be able to appreciate even more fashion fans - in Moscow his first bottle was finally opened, about which the designer and set up a dolce vita-style party.
I'm sure the most beautiful girls live in Russia.
That's why I'm particularly glad I opened a store in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there's really a part of me.
That's exactly what Igor said. He cut a red tape and invited all the people who wanted to... to follow the patterns that looked at!
Reactive aircraft manufacturers are hostile to the width of the seat when there are large orders on the horse
There was a heated dispute among the leading aircraft manufacturers about the width of the tourism class on the long-distance voyages, setting a tone for severe confrontation at the Dubai Aviation Exhibition this month.
The range of seats provided on the long-distance voyages to economic passengers whose interests are not always at the heart of the airlines, while the space allocated to them plays a key role in the allegations of the effectiveness of the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would have a width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the economic-class salons, but its main American competitor Boeing said it had to be decided by the airlines.
The slowdown occurs when aircraft manufacturers compete in the sale of the larger versions of their two-engine remote-master aircraft, and during the events of 17-21 November, potentially record orders are expected.
The composition of the rear part of the aircraft, in particular whether 9 or 10 persons are seated in a row, is central to the declarations on the economic efficiency of new mini-aerobus projects.
Boeing argues that its updated 777X will involve 406 people, based on seats in the economic class of more than 17 inches in width of 10 in each row.
Airbus said that the competing version of its A350 would transport 350 people in the economy at 18 inches in a row.
Aerial construction giants are often exchanged with technical issues through professional press advertising.
Now Airbus is addressing the public directly before the Dubai Air Force, where 777X is expected to become a leader with over 100 orders.
She recently showed what could be the beginning of a new advertising war by showing the financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant invited to each other, entitled “Would you agree to that?”
“Boeing offers further master flights in seats lower than in regional turbo-vine aircraft,” said the sales manager Airbus John Lihi.
With a change in diet, people take weight, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
By the early 1970s, by the time Boeing 747 had set standards for modern remote travel, and the average American male age from 40 to 49 years of age had increased by 10 per cent, according to the United States Department of Health.
The size of the 21st-century U.S. average man is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the concept of the 1950s sittings, when the average coverage of those who have recently been referred to as “reactive audience” has already been.
Airbus said it had ordered a study that showed that an additional inch in the width of the seat would improve the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing contests Airbus figures on seat sizes and says that manufacturers are not required to interfere in deciding how airlines find a balance between tariffs and amenities.
According to her, studies show that the comfort of the living room depends not only on the width of the seat.
“Everything is really about providing airlines with choices and opportunities to do what they think they should do in order to succeed,” said expert Boeing at the Kent Craver Chambers.
They don't want us to decide for them what's going to get them.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue is to increase the space on the side, but for suppliers it is becoming more and more a factor that can affect the income.
The argument is that the race for aircraft orders, estimated at at least $700 billion at catalogue prices in the coming decades, is sufficient to change the ratio of American and European exports.
For the first time, as Reuters reported in July, the presence of seats is what exacerbates competition in the fight between the latest reactive aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 per cent increase in profitability to one place in their last two motor remote master models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-place Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's claimed characteristics are partly based on comparisons of the 10-place series 777X with the original 9-place composition of the 777 constructive solution.
Winning in a separate property is reduced compared to the current ten-place composition.
“The reason that Boeing does this is to push more places and make his plane more competitive than ours,” said Kevin Kenston, head of the Airbus Comfort Division in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that rooms with a full 10-place range for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a flat landing that can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
“The seats with a width of eighteen inches would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is a threat from the 777th model,” said an Internet specialist Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide chairs, but offer a supplier directory from which airlines can choose.
Reactive aircraft vendors travel around the world even carry their roulettes to check competing plans.
In a comfortable manner, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very flat cabin layout for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10 local lines, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
Airbus has recently stressed the need for additional salons modifications, offering wider places for passage on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to “flight” but may draw attention to the wave of sales of model 777X.
A new anticoagulant vaccine may eliminate the smoking process of pleasure
Scientists have developed an anticoagulant vaccine that could eliminate cigarette smoking.
One dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the mouse from nicotine dependence for life.
Further tests are needed before tests are started on people, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Kristall of the Medical College of Will Cornell in New York said the first results were encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, testing all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern means,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been developed to carry genetic information for the production of antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to produce stable antibody flow.
Antithelials trace any nicotine molecules in the blood by neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing it from receiving a nicotinic stroke.
In the tests, vaccinated mice subsequently given nicotine continued their normal activities.
And the mice that were not given the vaccine were “depressed”, and this is a sign that nicotine came to their brain,” the researchers say.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, it was necessary to do so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the value of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it converts the cells to the antibodies factory.
Professor Kristall said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they would have a desire to try cigarettes, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it's more likely to be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not be satisfied with this because of nicotine vaccine, which can help them get rid of this habit,” he said.
British scientists said that the results were interesting but warned that further research was needed.
Oleiniks: the third rural settlements of Sub-Moscow
Vice-Governor Sub-Moscow Yuri Oleinik said that nearly three thirds of the villages in the Moscow area were fully eligible
A total of 187 settlements from 288 received from the region's budget.
In 2013, 187 settlements from 288 received grants from the area budget.
The specific amount of grants in the income of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent of the grants.
Approximately 25 billion rubles are sent from the area budget," Oleinik said.
The Deputy Governor also noted that only three urban settlements -- Mitič, Odinzovo and Puškyno -- had more than 1 billion rubles in 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million rubles, "that's not enough."
The cost of maintaining the local administrative unit in 88 settlements in Podmoskovya is more than 70 per cent, “there is a decrease in the quality of services,” Oleinik said.
He had previously instructed the heads of the municipalities of Sub-Moscow by the end of November to consider which settlements needed to be grouped, grouped in urban districts or a change in the administrative system.
These proposals will be drawn up by the end of January.
Formerly, the Governor of the Moscow Region stated that the administrative reform in Podsovski was planning to reduce the number of additional rural settlements.
Also in Mojaysk, Kashersk, Sunnykirsk, Colombia, Lübecks and Kotelniks, there is a demand for a population of municipalities.
This issue will begin in November in the cities and regions of the region.
The President of Mozambique, Igor Brennanalov, also said that, in the context of the upcoming reform, there were about 30 rural settlements in 12 areas of Sub-Moscow.
This is related to the fact that less than one third of 178 rural settlements in Sub-Moscow have a "acceptable" financial base and 100 are supplementary.
Diana Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina is not hiding what great pleasure she has received from raising her children.
Although Arbenina now spends a great deal of time on creativity and public activities, she still finds the opportunity to meet with Martha and Artem, and not only spends time on their training, but also enjoys as much as possible.
During the last week, Diane was twice reported to her worshipers about her pedagogical talents.
She first posted a photo in Facebook, which shows how she teaches children to read.
And yesterday, she asked the fans, showed me how she ordered Arthur and Martha to Halloween.
Our first Halloween," Diana called a picture of her children dressed in party costumes.
What's not wise is that they, like any other Russian boys and girls, are related to this holiday because they were born in America.
Germany first introduces an "unspecified gender" in Europe when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to be allowed to indicate “unspecified” when registering children born with fermaphrodites instead of male or female.
The child's parents will have the right to leave the "pol" graph in the birth certificate.
Instead of "F" (female gender) or "M" (male gender) parents may write "X" (unspecified).
This decision is designed to prevent parents from being pushed into an emergency with the "extension" of sex.
According to statistics, one of the 2,000 newborns in the world is born with a hermaphrodite.
Tripods deny that they are under the influence of Ouida.
Former Minister of Labour of New South Wales Joe Tripody will be a figure in the investigation of the anti-corruption oversight body of the state.
The former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi rejects the introduction of changes in the order of the lease of marine objects at the request of his political leader, Eddie Owayd, secretly owned by three state-owned real estate sites.
On Friday, the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Oaed had lobbyed several state ministers for extension of the lease to Serkular Ki, where the Oaed family owned two restaurants and coffee, without a tender after their expiry in August 2005.
She was now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripody knew the secret of Mr. Oeida ' s participation in real estate, after evidence given by the former Deputy Head of the Administration of Mr. Tripody Lynn Espoul on Thursday.
During several years of discussions started in 2005, the Government insisted that the rent be displayed in an open competition.
The tenants objected, as well as wanted longer rental time.
In 2009, contracts for the rental of enterprises at Serküllar Ki, which brought the Obeyd family around $2.5 million a year, were extended without an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Oeida, who, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, strongly advised changes in the rental policy of the Government.
In August and September 2007, the presentation of the IAC-distorted telephone conversations led to talks between Mr. Ooed, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dan, senior officer who came to the Ministry of Ports after Mr. Ooed's work in the Fisheries Division.
“Was there a question that had been discussed during these telephone conversations on the development of commercial rental policies?” asked Commissioner Anthony Willie Tripody.
"No," said Mr. Tripody.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Ooed.
According to the high-ranking official, Israeli military aircraft are attacking targets within Syria
The senior official of the Administration in the Fox News interview confirmed that Israeli military aircraft hit the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The officer didn't say it was a goal, but he said it was at least one.
Associated Press reports that the purpose of the Russian production was SA-125.
At least two times earlier this year, Israel carried aircraft with missiles inside Syria.
Foreign workers under sub-class 457 may be tested for “defence”
The “deptness” test for foreign workers in class 457 is under consideration by the Government, as it intends to expand the repressive measures.
This test, if adopted, will be applied on the criteria for preventing the use of a Class 457 visa to fill unqualified posts or as a lasagna to move family and friends to Australia.
The document submitted by the Government for discussion was published today, while former Lebanese MP Maxine McKew criticised the Government ' s rhetoric about foreign workers, said it could harm the neighbours of Australia.
“The huge statements of "foreigners - at the end of the line" and "at the beginning of the work of Australians" are a very unpleasant response to the times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Institute of Australia-India today.
Historically, this meant that white work had to be protected — and I would not be surprised if some in the region saw the references to this historical artifact.
The document submitted for discussion contains 12 measures previously considered by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday in Sri Lanka, where he met with officials on human trafficking, has already made five of the recommended changes and the others are in the process of consideration.
If the “delegation” criteria are adopted, the visa applicant may be examined as to “if there is a true candidate in a condition where the candidate is a relative or a close friend or a person having a relationship with the financing of the enterprise”.
Entrepreneurship may also be required to be accounted for by the number of holders of visas under heading 457, since prior enterprises intended to sponsor a small number of employees were then employed by a hundred.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan seeking asylum died allegedly from a heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees on the island of Christmas this week.
The man’s nine - year - old son was killed on his way to Australia, and since his father’s death on Wednesday, he has been supported by a twin brother who was also on board the ship.
The Australian authorities rushed the man to the hospital on the island of Christmas, where he died.
Comrade Semen Varlamova stated that hockey suffers from alcoholism
A friend of the hockeyist Semen Varlamov Evgenia Vavrinuk stated that he was suffering from alcoholism, the Russian Service of News.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking," said a woman, in particular.
Remember that Vavrinuk has tried to beat the Golkiper of the Russian collective Semen Varlamov, also a member of the Colorado Club.
According to her, the hockeyist ripped her off her hair, as well as stabbed her after her attack with damaged hands, chest, life, and neck.
Varlamov himself came with a warrant to the Denver police and confessed to the beating, detailing what had happened.
He was arrested, but then released at $5,000.
The court did not restrict sportsmen in the country's movements, but prohibited them from approaching Vavrinuk.
He was also threatened with imprisonment for up to 6 years for domestic violence.
The UK Government has announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact for Scotland on the HS2 project.
The HS2 project involves the opening of high-speed communications with Scotland and northern England, beginning the First Stage in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baronessa Kramer noted that the project “will unite the United Kingdom”.
Scotland's Transport Minister, Keith Brown, said he was “in a hurry” from the perspective of work on the plan with the British Government.
The first stage will be to build a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When the Second Stage is completed, the lines will be placed in Manchester and Lids.
In June, the Government revised the estimated value of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from £327.7 to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in the transit capacity of the railway and to reduce the length of travel to North England and Scotland.
This should include an opportunity to cross the road from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baronessa Kramer said: “Our goal of HS2 is to create a real national network that will make Britain and its city closer to each other.”
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge.
Without it, we will face a crisis of ability in our rail network.
But it is also about the transport of cities with each other; throughout Britain, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will receive a better communication through HS2.
Scotland's Secretary-General Alister Carmicle added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Kit Brown called on Mr. Carmicla to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed railway has every chance to bring enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds Scotland’s economic weight to the general argument for the high-speed railway throughout the United Kingdom.”
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the British Government to consider options for the construction of high-speed railway in Scotland, the creation of benefits for all and the continuation of the railway line by the Scottish Government of Glazgo, Edinburgh.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with the British ministers next year and the joint decision on the following steps.
Thorium is a new hope for nuclear energy?
Governments throughout the world continue to think about how to provide energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they are) has a negative effect on the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
Atomic energy is without it and without it, but it leaves behind a lot of waste.
Recent scientists have drawn attention to the turret - another radioactive element of the Mendelev system.
He is meeting around the world, and according to experts, it does not leave waste that has to be stored for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia to remain in force
Australian airlines will need to continue to exclude their plates and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite US mitigation measures relating to the devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during take-off and landing, provided they remain in the State of Flight.
Passengers may already do so during the main part of the flight, but many are upset that they do not have access to their electronic books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which requires American airlines to carry out a huge amount of work to meet new requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Office also noted that they were considering this statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of the flight are still in operation in Australia.
“The safety management of civil aviation flights currently does not have special rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” it said.
The issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to maintain safety at any time, and passengers to comply with the safety rules reported to them by crew members.
The Virgin company, which had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Office the expansion of its entertainment system on board with Wi-Fi, was not against change, but stated that it would follow the direction of the regulator.
“We would welcome the consideration by the Civil Aviation Safety Office of the issue of the authorisation of electronic devices, because we really think that this will improve the quality of customer service now that it (the wireless entertainment system) is on our aircraft”, the press secretary said.
Qantas stated that he would abide by the rules at this point.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during landing and landing, and we are not planning to change them soon,” she said.
The FAU regulation applies to American airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly carefully examine the decision of the FAO and its causes.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from the airline to the airline and will depend on the age of their airport.
Carriers will have to prove that their aeroplanes have the sustainability of radio interferences from mobile devices, as well as to review the benefits, training materials, hand-carrying standards and instructions for passengers.
“After the airline checks and confirms the viability of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic books and smartphones at any height,” said FAO.
In rare cases, the crew will give instructions to passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
In addition, according to the group's recommendation, the heavier devices should be located under seats or in the upper luggage compartments during take-off and landing.
The head of Dagestan is heard in the sky of Cuba's notes of extremism
The football match between Anji and Cuba fell into a political conflict between the authorities of the Krasnodar province and Daguestan after the patients had burned the Dagestan flag, and the Cuban gym sounded different.
The Head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdullatip on Thursday invited the Republican parliamentarians to refer to the court because the Krasnodar province's gym is allegedly calling for an inter-national divide, in particular for the war with the "Bassurmans".
Take the Gym of the Krasnodar province, it has been approved in 1995.
That's the same thing, and no one's doing it.
"Observing you here, as the mother of a relative, as the enemy, as we go to the Basurman, we will go to the battle of death," said Abdullah President of the House of Hizri Shissaid.
Putin gained impunity for his friend Assad
And now it's news from the ocean, and it's Syria, where, as we know today, Israel hit Russian production missiles, which are reportedly meant to be Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important requirement to destroy its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was done in the framework of an agreement reached through Russia and allowing the United States not to carry out a military operation that they had completed this summer.
More detail on the weapon and what it means to the Syrian President, our chief international correspondent, Richard Angel, will tell.
Washington said the Assad regime would be punished for that.
More than 1,400 peacekeepers, including hundreds of children, died in August of the poisoning gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal set up by a friend of Asada-Vladimir Putin.
Syria will withdraw from its chemical weapons to the middle of the next year.
And today is an important time.
The Group of International Experts reported that Syria had taken out of the building the alleged chemical production factories.
The longer-term and more difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and its components.
We understand it's about a thousand tons.
D.C. said the days of Assad were supposed to be.
I think Assad has to go.
The question is not whether this will happen, but when it will happen.
He's no longer a legitimist, and he has to leave.
But Assad remains.
And he feels even more confident.
His army continues to use artillery, rockets and palm trees.
Its opponents are well-versed and badly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many starving.
Some need to be fed with leaves and baskets.
Many believe that Bashar Assad escaped the punishment for mass murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement called the success of diplomacy, the Inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself made an impression on the person willing to cooperate.
Today in Washington, the US Ambassador to Syria had to answer some simple questions.
When the child is starving, his mother may not be as easy as killing him with chemical weapons.
Assad will hold.
And he's turning weapons into power.
President RF has established a separate Ministry of Construction and CWC
Russia's President Vladimir Putin created a new ministry that was responsible for the construction and construction of ZKH and proposed that his former governor of the Ivanov region, Michael Menu, take the lead in the personal meeting.
The President met with Mihail Meem at his residence in Novo-Ogarrevo, and Menh did not refuse to take the lead in the new department.
The President of Russia's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov explained that all construction and GCH functions are moving to a new Ministry from the Min Region.
Michael Menn, son of the famous Orthodox priest Alexander Manja, finished the Moscow Institute of Petroleum by name of Gubkin.
Since 1995, his political career has begun - he has been elected to Moscow's district council from the Sergiovo-Posada region, has been a Member of the State Duma, the first Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of Moscow, and the Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of Moscow.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Michael Menh was the governor of the Ivanov Region.
Lumber owners in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is experiencing difficulties.
At the Bendemir shopping mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthhalinga has set up a gold bracelet, ring and chain to pay for her daughter's schooling.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is put in there," says Mrs. Amirthhaling.
Although she earns S$3000 ($2400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of South-East Asia -- where household debt is growing -- such that ValueMax, where it is carrying out its transaction, became the third lobby on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
The loan for jewelry is not just a quick way to obtain money (S$1300 in the case of Ms. Amirthhaling), but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In Singapore, there is usually an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent, above 15.4 per cent proposed by the United Overseas Bank, a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, the ramparts have the advantage that they do not require credit checks or pay evidence and can issue loans faster than banks.
Thus, millions of people throughout the region are being beaten because families feel pressured by increasing the cost of living and fast growth in household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustainable growth followed by the global financial crisis, and the economic credit that has been subject to free monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are being turned into launderers to compensate for income reductions as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, indicated an increase in the family credit back, mainly due to the increase in the mortgage, as a risk factor for the credit capacity of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest debt ratio of households to the gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia led this list of 80 per cent of GDP compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has barely escaped a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a steady decrease in exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
“The judgment is that with rising prices, people in the middle and lower [income scales] will look for ways to fill their income wherever they can,” says Song Seng Won, economist CIMB, Malaysian bank.
The record of high gold prices in the last two years has strengthened the urgency with which people have placed their personal belongings, as they use the opportunity to obtain money for their family decorations.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the items placed at 200 city-state lobbying sites are gold products.
People say, "The price for gold is good, let's put a golden chain on the granny and get it back in the next month."
In Thailand, the largest shipyard operator EasyMoney has seen an increase in the number of clients using its offices in the last few months, up to 20 per cent.
Growth in the stockbroker business, such as ValueMax, the operator of the office in Bendemire and 15 others in Singapore, is planning to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where it has four shops, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Li Ching, Executive Director of ValueMax.
The company will finance an increase of 60 per cent of the S$66 million involved this week as a result of the placement of shares on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some creditors had been criticizing the fire for high interest rates, Ms. Yeah said that the Lambard not only offered cheaper tariffs than other creditors, it also did not increase the debt directly.
“The clients are depositing the items they already own, and the montization of personal assets does not increase the debt of households,” she says.
The loan is gaining increasing public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secure funding.
However, there are not only those categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
The rich people in Singapore also use the ValueMax offices, laying gold pictures or Rolex hours, which can give up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cash.
We see customers from all walks of society.
“They include real people who need to make short-term money for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses who need to cope with temporary cash difficulties,” says Ms. Jahah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, not the number and status of existing medical institutions, but the quality of medical care provided, is important for the population.
The implementation of the Tul Area Health Modernization programme 2011-2013, the reorganization of our city's health facilities will create an optimal health care structure for the population, including gynecological diseases, births and births.
Thus, after joining the gorilla, there was still a great opportunity to attract narrow specialists from the NSCB GHG to consult with various pathologies, carry out additional hospital-based surveys.
During the modernization programme, the logistic base of the home had been significantly improved and modern equipment conforming to world standards had emerged.
Over the years, around 8 million rubles have been allocated for the capital repairs of premises, and 112 units of equipment have been purchased for 42 million rubles.
The most modern equipment has an intensive post for newborns.
The Cell-Syver machine is used for surgery in the case of the cutting process, allowing the collection of blood from the operating wound and after special treatment to return to the family by avoiding the transfusion of foreign blood.
Modern equipment is also equipped with a laboratory diagnostic office.
The women ' s consultation has an electronic register, and the introduction of electronic maps and patient history is expected in the near future.
The development of telemedicine made it possible to consult gynecological patients, pregnant women, infants and newborns with regional specialists.
Chechens beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Citizens of Chechnya were arrested by the French police on suspicion of serial assaults on prostitutes.
The investigation has been carried out since March of the current year.
Some 60 women complained about the action of the caucasians.
The gangs reportedly ordered prostitutes in one of the Strasbourg hotels and then killed and robbed them.
The gang leader was a 27-year-old Chechnya.
The defender of Bavaria David Alabama became Austria's best sportsman in 2013, reports the official Bundesliga website.
In this dispute, he faced winter sports representatives who traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was occupied by the mountain ranger Marcel Hirscher, and the third was lying on the cliffs with Gregor Schlerenzauer's tramp.
In the past season, a 21-year-old Austrian Filipino-Nigerian had helped his team to win the League of Champions, Champions and Kubque Germany, as well as the UEFA Supercube.
An ex-wife of Archavin is resting with actor Andre Chadov
An ex-citizen footballer from Peter's "Zenite" Andrei Arshavin Julia Baranovski is on vacation with actor Andrei Chadov.
Julia is resting in Italy in the company of actress Anastasia Zajerno, her wife, the figure of Sergei Slavov, and actor Andrei Chadova.
The photos from the couple's shared walks are published in Instagram Anastasia Zajerski.
It's not the first joint photo of Andrea and Julia.
On 5 October, the Railway published a photo of a couple standing on the shore of the Finnish Gulf in Comarov.
In mid-October, the Zenita Hubbek, Andrei Arshavin, admitted to living apart from his civil wife, Julia.
Remember, Julia Baranovski and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003, with three children.
It was recently known that Archavines met with the ex-model Alice Kazmine.
The new girlfriend of Archavin was married to the top manager of the corporation.
Savings package $325 million for the health of Tasmania
The Federal Government insists that the $325 million relief package for Tasmania's weakened health system will be complemented by harsh conditions that guarantee that the Government will not spend its resources in vain.
The Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth was taking “fast measures” to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing of the population of that island state, the higher levels of chronic diseases and the system restrictions.
The funding decision was taken for four years after the Government's consultations with the independent Member of Tasmania Andrew Wilke.
"The Government has proposed a package of emergency rescue measures, which we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state," said Mrs. Plibersek today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million per close company for planned operations.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract removal operations, will help to overcome delay.
There is also money for clinics that receive unannounced patients in Hobart and Lonseston to improve the quality of care after the station, training medical professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical cards in local hospitals.
“These investments will be made by advanced physicians to implement the idea of better assisting the health system of Tasmania,” said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania should work in strict reporting and accountability.
The State would need to maintain current funding levels in order to obtain the funds of the Commonwealth and to report monthly on where it would spend those additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides services as effectively and as effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilki said today that $325 million would not decide “if they did not follow a genuine reform that would put the Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable footing”.
However, he commended the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, with which he first addressed the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will significantly contribute to the conclusion of this state’s health system from a critical point of view,” said Mr. Wilki.
According to the Government, these additional sampling procedures compensate significantly for recent reductions.
But the federal opposition health representative, Peter Datton, believes that the present statement is “a decision similar to a lakoplaster”.
"The reason we're here is that the Labour Government has expelled $430 million from the health system," he told ABC TV.
When the Government of the State spends almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, it cannot be assumed that it is good news.
Mr. Datton asked Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The screenplay by Giome Nickle Romana Danny Didro can be praised with exceptional order and historical details, but it is also more difficult to understand than it should have been.
The film, which took place in France in the 1760s, tells the dark story of Susanna, a young aristocrat who was sent to the monastery of her family.
When she begins to rebel, she suffers extreme cruelty from the hands of a sadist and procurator and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film is never released until it's lost or sensational — and that's the whole problem.
Because of its severe festive nature, the report risks being a type of trap and for the audience.
Syria destroyed its chemical weapons production facilities, said the Monitoring Group
Syria destroyed the basic equipment for the production of chemical weapons and gaseous ammunition, declared an international monitoring group on Thursday, while severe clashes were raging in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
The Syrian group of activists also stated on Thursday that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
A statement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made within one day
the end of 1 November, established by the Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or “make incapacitated” all chemical weapons and mechanisms to mix chemicals with toxic gas and fill them with ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious schedule that aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
Destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, the destruction of existing weapons and stockpiles still needs to be begun by Damascus.
The country is thought to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including bitter gas and nerve paralytic gas.
This statement was made during the severe fights on Thursday in the city of Sapphira, which, in the opinion of the experts, is the object of chemical weapons production, as well as its storage sites, reports the Syrian Centre for the Protection of Human Rights in Britain.
The group of activists who had been tracking the loss through the network of activists in Syria stated on Thursday that 120,296 people had been killed.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6365 children.
On behalf of the Government, the group stated that 29,954 persons were members of the armed forces of President Bashar Assad, 18 678 were pro-government fighters and 187 were Lebanese fighters of Hezbollah.
Also among the victims, as stated in the statement, were 2202 military conquerors and about 5375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
According to the United Nations estimate of 25 July, 100,000 people died in conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this figure has not been updated.
The conflict forced some 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's forces fought rebels in Sapphira for several weeks, many of which are related to Al-Qaeda groups.
The Centre stated that there were victims on both sides on Thursday, but did not bring any specific data.
The paints highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, driven by the time-consuming period of their mission to free Syria from the toxic arsenal, in the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, said that its team was “now satisfied with the fact that it had verified and seen all the essential materials and equipment for mixing/processing declared by Syria to be destroyed”.
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned”.
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites claimed by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two security posts, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW stated that both sites were, according to the Syrian declaration, “refused and... objects of the chemical weapons programme contained therein were moved to other declared sites that were checked”.
It was not possible to determine immediately whether the site in Sapphira was one of two places that the OPCW inspectors had not been able to visit.
Syria introduced a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
“I welcome the courage and courage that you all have shown in carrying out the most complex mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said Ahmet Uzumju, Director General of the Monitoring Group, in a comment published by the OPCW.
For the third year, civil war has been facing rebels, mostly Muslim Sunni, with the Government of Assad and its security forces, which are members of its Alaivit sect, the response of Shiite Islam.
With regard to other events, the leader of Rami Abdurrahman Centre said that there was a strong explosion on the environment at the WFP in the coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Angry over the sentence to the organizers of the act in Bali
The remaining 202 victims and relatives of the explosion in Bali in 2002 were angry at the sentence issued by the last of the defendants who came before the court and stated that Umar Patek should be shot.
The Patek, who has been running for nearly 10 years, as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in the creation of explosive devices used during a terrorist attack.
It may be released within 15 years if it is granted conditional release.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass killings as a result of an attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, during which 202 people, including 88 Australians, were killed and ten others were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorist-related charges, including the explosions of churches throughout Indonesia in the Canon of Christmas in 2000.
The prosecutors demanded a lifetime of life, although they could insist that the person who had been known as a "brainer" for his reputation as an explosive master should be sentenced to death.
This decision has exacerbated the painful memories of the mother of Perta Jun Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin and Jenny's twins in a terrorist attack by Patek and his associates nearly ten years ago.
She could hardly hold back her tears and said that Patek had to be sentenced to death.
“I really believe that he should follow the feet of other men.
He must appear before the firing squad," said Ms. Cortin AAP.
"I have to live every day, knowing that I will have no grandchildren anymore, and I will not see my daughters."
The Sarah Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was put into service outside the parked van immediately after 11 a.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where a terrorist bomber blew up a rifle that was triggered by an explosion 20 seconds earlier.
After that, he fell into a coma and died three times a month, being connected to the life insurance system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should divide the participation of three other members of the terrorist cell "Jemaa Islamia " responsible for the bloody war " , " Amroz, Muhlas and Imam Samudra " who were sentenced four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty most of all.
Keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
To get 20 years after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds is not so much.
The Patek is the last of the actors in the Bali to be represented before the court.
He hid for nearly ten years, but was finally detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US troops killed former head of Al-Qaeda Usama Ben Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent showed that the findings showed that Patek had been in Pakistan to meet with Ben Laden in an attempt to restore relations between South-East Asia and Al-Qaida terrorist groups.
"He didn't give up," said Mrs. Cortin.
Until recently, he had not regretted how much he had done to others.
A sentence was given before the 10th anniversary of the act, to be observed later this year in Bali and Australia.
“This year there will be a lot of tears,” says Ms. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: Air passengers can now use boyfriends on aircraft (but not phone calls)
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not talk on mobile phones, according to the long-term new guidelines published by the Fourth Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect changes to take place immediately.
As such a change is rapidly taking place, depending on the airline, FAU administrator Michael Wert said at the press conference.
The airlines will have to show FAU how their aircraft complies with the new guidelines and update their training manuals for flight crew members and the device regulations to comply with the new guidelines.
FAU stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to increase the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that had already introduced plans.
“Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon,” FAU said.
Passengers are currently obliged to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door is closed.
They must not restart them until the aircraft reaches 10,000 feet and the captain will “do well”.
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the aircraft is lowered to land, and not include them until the aircraft appears on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, aircraft whose aeroplanes are adequately protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and running, FAU said.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Shipowners, welcomed these changes.
“After the new policy has been successfully implemented (and we are going to work in close contact with the carrier to achieve this), it will be an easy option,” Glading said.
We were absolutely tired of being “on-school leave” when it came to this issue.
But connection to the Internet for serfing, exchange of e-mails, text messages or uploading data would still be prohibited at a height of less than 10,000 feet, the Agency reported.
Passengers will be invited to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices into aircraft mode.
Thus, there is still no “Word with Friends” – an Internet-intellectual game in which the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when the incident occurred: the actor was removed from the American Airlines aircraft for refusing to switch off the device at the time the aircraft was on landing.
And more heavy devices, such as laptops, will still have to be placed in a luggage office, as they can hurt someone if they fly all over the living room.
Mobile phones in the field will also continue to be banned.
Regulatory authority on telephone calls is owned by the Federal Communications Commission, not by FAO.
FAU may remove the ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Safety Board, the National Transport Safety Expert CBS News, said that hundreds of phones were still at risk.
“The telephones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create spaces for navigation devices, but we know from FCS that they can create spaces for the top of the clock when the aircraft is in the air,” said Rosenker.
The Sectoral Advisory Committee established by FAU to examine this issue recommended last month that the Government permit the wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on FAU has increased to reduce restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Senator-Democratic of the state of Missory Claire McCasky, claim that there are no major security-related reasons for bans.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult, as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
FAU began to limit the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to mixed navigation and communication equipment messages, when passengers began carrying FM radio receivers, high-tech guys at the time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than on previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developed and approved by FAU as sustainable for electronic mixing.
Air carriers have offered passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruise altitude for several years.
Airplanes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to fluctuations.
The vast majority of liners are adapted for the wider use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines, Warta said.
Today ' s electronic devices usually emit radio signals far less powerful than previous generations of devices.
Electronic reading devices, for example, only emit minimum signals when browsing pages.
But signals become more powerful when devices load or send data.
Among those seeking to mitigate restrictions on the use of electronic devices was Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company's representatives loaded the entire aircraft with their electronic reading devices Kindle and flew on it to verify the existence of problems, but did not detect them.
The members of the Advisory Committee of the FAU expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of devices presents any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Air Passengers said that he considered the confusion of the devices to be real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other Committee members said that there were only individual pilot communications confirming that devices could create gaps for aviation systems, and most of them were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAU allow the pilots to require passengers to shut off devices during the installation of devices in a condition of limited visibility.
The group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling for their health-care measures to give passengers who are now using a number of technological devices.
“We are pleased that FAU recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and protection,” said Roger Dow, Director General of the U.S. Tourism Association.
Schools will be able to conduct examinations for driving rights
Exams on driving rights will be available to private companies with their own computerized highway.
The Commersant writes about this with reference to the draft Government ' s decision on vehicle management.
According to the newspaper, there are currently about 30 such vehicles in Russia.
Students of such "privileged" car schools are expected to count the results of the internal test.
In doing so, the Gosavto inspection will monitor the examinations every half of the year.
If it is found that more than 30 per cent of the theoretical exams and more than 20 per cent of the students do not give up for the first time, such a school will be deprived of half-year privileges.
The technical requirements for motorways contained in the draft Government order shall enter into force from 5 November 2014.
The project also contains requirements for two-wheel driving.
From 1 January 2015, the owners of motorcycles for category A rights will be required to submit an examination in the context of urban traffic.
Moreover, as of 5 May 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign rights.
Such workers would be required to receive Russian rights after the examination.
Birds dropped by air safely from the North Sea storm site, released back to wild nature
A bird scattered on the seabed after being found in a depleted state at a high oil level in the North Sea was released back into the wild.
The watertight was placed in a helicopter sent to Aberdin last month and was then released by the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Animal Abuse (SPCA) at the rescue centre in Alloa.
The manager of the Colin Seddon Centre said: "This waterfall is probably a winter migrant from North Europe, who has fallen into a strong wind zone over the North Sea."
It seems that the bird has suspended and was able to find shelter on an oily height.
He said: She was not able to fly again; therefore they came unto us for help.
The watering trough was healthy and in good condition until it was released.
Is the elite of Europe ready to take business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the commitment to bring together business representatives and to determine what changes British welfare and jobs developers want to see in relation to the EU.
To this end, we have ordered the largest and most complete survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their views on Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a large business in the United Kingdom by sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will prove to be unexpected for many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking for export opportunities beyond Europe, paying particular attention to the countries that are modernizing and growing, while the EU countries are on hold.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than wasteing time on the long and difficult process of reforming the EU's troubled institutions.
When asked about their views on specific political issues, from anti-monopoly regulation to product laws, most business leaders felt that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction in the single market, with business representatives claiming that the costs of regulation from Brussels are now outweighing the benefits of finding a trade area in Europe, with even 40 per cent of the largest enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European of all companies.
The latest and most evident is our survey of business leaders found that the clear majority wants Britain to take a course on treaty change and on trade-based relations with the EU rather than politics.
This result, which was seen among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that the business insists on a “significant change”, which will return authority to Britain.
The high rate is the achievement of treaty changes and more favourable conditions for Britain will ensure a 16 per cent vote in order to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British business supports its plan to review the conditions of British membership in the EU.
It also shows that the business expects the revision to lead to a significant shift in the current balance of forces back to the United Kingdom.
The better conditions for the British business are possible and becoming increasingly necessary as the euro area enters the path of closer economic and financial union.
Priority must be given to jobs and economic growth in Britain, and as the results of our survey show, this means a stronger focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels's regulatory activities.
U.S. Services Listening to the Pope’s Personal Phone
The Vatican's activities are under the supervision of American special services.
New documents from the Edward Snouden collection show that the U.S. intelligence has led to the hearing of all the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and now the Pope of France is fully guarding.
His phone began to listen even before he became the head of the Vatican.
The election process of the new pope was under surveillance.
Why the United States was given special importance.
The special service was connected to hundreds of cardinals who had gathered in Rome to pick up a regular Pope.
The telephones of the residence were also heard where the conclaves lived.
The American spies listened to all the main applicants on the papal throne in order to prevent the appearance of a Washington figure.

Snowboarders for the Olympic Cup took special photos
The Bank of Russia issued an Wednesday note on the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held in this winter.
Nominal cups are 100 rubles.
But in the web, bloggers are already actively ironicing about the memory banknote.
Following the presentation of the Olympic Cup on 30 October, they pointed out that the image of a banknote sub-board could be found in photobanks.
In particular, in a free StockExchange photo store, where this photo is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in a Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website Megaobsor on 18 January 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in RugGear smartphones.
The Olympic Banknote is run in blue and blue gamma.
On the one hand, a snowboarder flying over Sochi and on the other, a species of the Olympic Stadium and the Ghar-bird.
Author of the Banknote Design - Pavel Bushuev, who won the race among the students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Art of Repina.
The presentation noted that several types of sport were considered, such as mountain gorillas, fristils and tramplin beads, but eventually they selected a subboard because it was a relatively young sport.
According to the source, near the CB, the regulator is not indifferent to the general public ' s view of the widespread dissemination of the image of the re-broadcast from the Olympic Bank and is now studying the situation.
And that's not too much of a noise around the Olympic banknote in Gozanka.
Mr. Natalya Nikiforov, the Press Manager, said that all the discussions on plagiarism were ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the banknotes will return to the right, on the photos in the network - on the left, - specified Nikiforov.
The person in the photo session was taken from different points of view, then the final image was selected, which is characteristic outside the sub-board.
She also noted that copyright laws were not applicable to the Olympic Banknote, since the artist had been paid for his work.
In the opinion of the experts, the discussion of images on the Olympic Cup was positive.
The ability of the computer image - plus for its advancement - is considered by NP Executive Director "RusBrend" Alexei Popovicev.
Evidence of the percentage of images on the computer and in photobanks is quite difficult, so the demand for intellectual property dispute on the image is unlikely.
For the first time, the Olympic Banknote appeared in China at the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008 and a memory note was issued in June 10.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Legislative bans forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers have a bad mood.
According to them, the consumption of beer in the country will remain at the previous level in the future, and that is best.
Although businessmen were originally expected to grow.
The current year is a failure for them: sales fell by 7 per cent.
All this has been done by the head of one of the largest beer companies in the country, President of the Council of the Union of Russian Beers Isaac Sheps at the 3rd Annual Conference of the Adam Smith Institute for Daily Demand in Russia, which just ended in Moscow.
It was discussed by the public regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already fallen by 18 per cent, as in recent years the country has seen a significant increase in the regulation of the beer industry in the production and circulation of low-alcohol beer, reported Sheps to listeners.
No country in the world has such a strict restriction on the beer market, an unforeseeable introduction of all new and illogical bans, which are based on the allegations of combating alcohol abuse.
The brewer noted that many legislative prohibitions aimed at reducing alcohol abuse did not have a special impact, but all new initiatives were constantly under way.
Most of the beer producers have been affected by the ban on the sale of alcohol in kiosks that has been introduced this year.
"We just lost 35,000 consumers," said Isaac Sheps.
For the next year, brewers have two forecasts.
The optimist is the one that Sheps said: sales of alcohol remain at the former level.
The pessimistic will drop by another 2-3 per cent.
In order to preserve its profits, businessmen are forced to leave the classes that are expected to the consumer in the premium class: beer will become smaller, but it will be worth it.
However, the radical consequences of the fall in sales with a small amount of alcohol have not yet been seen.
“In my view, the level of alcoholism remains at about the same level,” said Dr. Alexey Captain.
True, it has increased the proportion of patients who use strong drinks as well as those who "suck" into drinking alcoholic beverages such as "Jaguara", while ten years ago it was the booze of alcoholism.
In September, 600 people were released from the Ford car plant in Universal.
According to the trade unions, all those fired were compensated.
However, where the problem of workers is more acute, there is a problem of reduction of production in the region.
A member of the Zacksa Aleksey Etmanov district said at the meeting that around 600 people had been cut off from the Ford plant in Universal.
According to him, it was still in September: at that time, about 600 people had left the factory in conjunction with the organization ' s trade union.
“Golden parachutes” were offered for several salaries by workers who decided to resign themselves.
As a result, the vast majority have left jobs on their own.
However, according to Etmanov, this number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's gonna limit it.
However, the authorities for the next two years do not plan to adopt any programmes of support for disadvantaged regional enterprises," he explained, adding that the Government did not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large reduction of jobs.
Ford does not challenge or confirm this information.
We expect a response from the company, and as soon as it appears, we must publish it.
Talks about reducing workers at Forda plant in Universal.
For example, the company's plans to release 600 people became known in September.
The plant had previously stated that the production of cars would be suspended.
As a reason for the plant, they called the fall of the Ford car in Russia.
According to Petrostat, industrial production in Lenoblastia declined by 5.4% after nine months 2013.
Vehicle and equipment production decreased by 11.5 per cent.
In the United States, mobile phones can be used during take-off and landing
New rules for safe use of mobile devices during take-off and landing have been approved in the United States, reported by the BBC tele-corporation.
US airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the journey, and new rules will begin to work by the end of 2013.
However, contact with the Internet for receiving and sending e-mails will be prohibited during flights of less than 3 kilometres.
Because of the danger of interference with aircraft radio equipment, a hundred voice communication will remain under ban.
Thus, air passengers will be allowed to read electronic books, play board games and other gadgets and watch videos during internal and international transfers.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to check the safety of the use of electronic devices during the flight.
In addition, the airlines will have to convince the U.S. federal civil aviation management that they can cope with the alleged impact of aircraft mobiles and aircraft controls.
According to the source, for example, the United States may also review existing standards for the use of electronic devices in flight.
For the Russian Mafia in the U.S., a new name has finally been added - "Bratian Circle"
This week a black list of Russian Mafia in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The United States Ministry of Finance introduced three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli.
One of the Russians was a well-known singer, Gregory Leps, whom the United States suspected of transporting money to members of the group.
It is still on the US black list of 22 people participating in the Brotherhood and six organizations affiliated with it.
However, many experts question the existence of such an organization.
"The announcement of the 'Brat Circle' is more likely to unite the various criminal groups," said an expert on organized crime and professor at the University of New York Mark Galeotti.
In his view, the "British Circle" reflects the popular perception of the "Russian Mafia".
"I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anyone else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization," quoted Mr. Galeotti, U.S. Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galeotti agreed with Professor George Mason Liz Shelly.
“If they are working together, it is more like a criminal network, but not an organization,” says the Centre for Research on Corruption and Organized Crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the "British Circle" unites to a greater extent a Russian hero in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as Grandpa Hassan.
The criminal authority was killed in January of this year.
Thus, Lashi Shushanashvili and Zahariya Kalashov, who completed the list in 2012, were closely related to Grand Hasan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was named Grand Hasan.
However, Mr. Galeotti noted that some individuals were not related to Usoyan.
In his view, all of them were more closely united in financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion in the "British Circle" by Gregory Leps, the favorite singer of Russia's President Vladimir Putin, drew Kremlin's attention.
Of course, we expect more detailed information from our American partner colleagues, as a result of which such a decision was made, to be included in such lists, says the Press Secretary of the Head of State Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the RF.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the FP, its interests will be protected.
Head of Gasprom Alexei Miller says the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas field
The start of the construction of the "South Stream" pipeline in Bulgaria means the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said Gazprom.
“Today there has been a significant event: the construction of the Bulgarian gas pipeline "South Stream", the largest and most important project in Europe,” said President Gazprom Alexey Miller in his statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
The South Stream is intended to diversify Russia's export routes across Europe.
The dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, where the bulk of Russia ' s gas is destined for Europe, increases the risk to ordinary routes, officials say.
Miller said that direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “always removed”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive a low-priced "South Stream" gas as soon as the whole project starts working in 2015.
Gasprom stated that construction should start in other countries further along the gas pipeline by the end of the year.
The annual project capacity of pipelines is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
This morning in the Saratsky area, the driver of the Peugeot car went to the meeting area for 115 km along the road of Odessa-Reni, and met a bus with six people.

Two YMCA officers were charged with sexual offences even before charges against Jonathan Lord, as reported by the Royal Commission
Two YMCA NSW staff members were charged with sexual crimes against children before charges were filed in 2011 against the childcare agency in Karingbache Jonathan Lord, reported to the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children.
But the Commission's introductory statement stated that it had “never dealt with cases of sexual violence against children within its organization”.
The Chief Executive Director, Philip Heira, was asked about one case where a YMCA employee was accused of child pornography offences and the other one where the instructor was deported to YMCA Caringbah Hall for sexual crimes against children under his care in 1991.
Mr. Harry told Gail Fernness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case, but didn't know about the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA introductory speech for the Commission also allowed for inaccuracies, claiming that “there were external tests of YMCA that recognized that YMCA was in the first line to ensure the safety of children”.
The evidence provided by the commissions suggests that YMCA was notified that it had received a second from four possible evaluations following the quality audit carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hayer, who joined YMCA when he was 21, acknowledged that he and the lower leadership had let go by hiring Lords, and that he was unable to provide a clear understanding by staff of his obligations regarding the reporting of violations of the child ' s security policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual crimes against 12 boys for two years at YMCA.
He was in prison for at least six years.
But Mr. Harry rejected the assumption that the YMCA corporate ethics had prevented staff from reporting Lord's violations in the field of child security.
The officials testified that they observed violations, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, that he was personally behind them, that he had put them on his knees, that he loved one of them, and that he allowed them to play with his cell phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under the leadership of the Lord and asked to teach her child protection because she was concerned about his conduct, testified that Jacky Barnat, the guardian of the YMCA office in Karingbach, who was the head of the Lord, was “a frightened and often difficult sight”.
The Executive Director said that he did not explain to staff that they had been reluctant to report the situation to their superior managers.
Rather, he said that their friendship with the Lord led them to think of the need to communicate about him.
Mr. Harry said that he had presented to the Board of the YMCA of New South Wales his opinion that the lesson for the organization from the “accident with Jonathan Lord” was not “to provide information” by staff, and the Board agreed with him.
Mr. Hayer said that the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the indictments had been issued was adopted by the Director-General of YMCA for Child Care, Liam Whitley.
He said that it was intended to prevent a breach of evidence, but it was “resurrected” and the decision was badly realized.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not safe for children by the organization during her work, Jonathan Lord between 2009 and 2011, a commission of experts on the growth of children, Professor Steven Smolboun, at the University of Griffith.
He said there were “serious problems” in the recruitment, selection, training, training and monitoring of staff.
The hearings shall be postponed until 20 December.
A week of fashion in San Paulo.
She's not just a model, she's a real star.
Although Giselle Bundshen had for some time left her job as a mother, she had come to a special place in those days and this week’s parade.
The absence of many months did not prevent her from keeping her place on the stage and on the pedestal.
Giselle remains the highest-paid supermodel in the world.
This time she took part in the "Kolchchi" brand.
The final week of fashion is usually the most interesting performances.
It's kind of like, "Lino Willaventura."
The brand is more than 30 years old, parallel to the production of a luxury pre-port, the model works actively in theatre and cinema, designing spectacles and developing costumes for many famous paintings.
In general, more than 30,000 companies and companies that are related to the textile industry and the world of fashion participated in the final week of the fashion in São Paulo.
This is one of the most dynamicly developing areas of production, which employs more than 2 million Brazilians, with annual turnover of $50 billion.
Tony Blair said he was taking the chance to return as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but admitted that the return was unlikely.
Earlier this evening, in an interview on the fifth anniversary of his retirement, 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after ten years as a leader, Blair has avoided much of the British policy discussion, limiting most of his comments on foreign affairs and his role as a ambassador to the quarter of the Middle East peacekeepers.
Responding to the question of whether he would return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said, "Yes, of course, but it's not going to happen, so... "
The Master Coach of Milan Masimiliano Allerry regretted the results of the 10th round of the Italian Championship with Lacio.
The specialist also noted that the failure at the start was caused by a series of injuries to leading players.
I'm very sorry that we couldn't win, but Tmw says Allegry.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first time, we didn't let Lacio do anything.
In the second Roman, they added, but in general, I can't say that we've lost concentration.
We had to win.
Last season, we had a mission to hit the League of Champions.
Now we're off the schedule, but it's due to the entire series of key football injuries.
Rammy and Honda?
It's a very good game, with a character.
But our composition is good now.
Look at Koka, who's held a high-level meeting.
The experts from the competitions coming to Cardiff to fight for the Year's Prize knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready to show up for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months earlier who had taken his first steps, this kid with his little Shetland pony, Toffii, slipped through three tours to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This undisclosed couple — the same growth — received high ratings for the appearance, behavior, and style of the annual competition held by the Sannibunk horse racing centre in Radri near Cardiff.
Having taken a general look at men's and women's background in finely dressed cats, he swung his hat and proudly held around two-year-old Toffi.
The judges praised Fenton for his not yet year-old ingenuity to treat the horses.
And Toffi has received a high degree of externality and character.
Fenton was given to Toffi on his third birthday in March last year, and since then he has been dealing with Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Toffi are a great duet."
They had many rivals, but these two left with a golden cup and a goose.
It was just his second speech from Toffy, and we were all in a hurry when he won.
The perfectly unknown people in the arena thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Eb-Weil in South Wales, is walking on his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exhibiting horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "The whole audience was hit, and everyone shouted for approval, and they were shouting."
He ran through the sand all along the arena and, although he looked so fragile, did his work wonderfully.
He loves horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two shoes he cares about.
In view of what he started, he will soon take part in the Loshadi of the Year — and I am sure he will do well.
The representative of this annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to deal with his ponies."
They're a great team, though.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffi for their appearance and how they presented themselves on the show.
They appreciate the agreement of the pony and the manufacturer, Fenton and Toffy, were the best in the ring.
I'm sure that Fenton helped him pull up, he really looked good in his role.
Published call for the Chinese newspaper “Reorganization”
The Chinese newspaper, which issued a first call for the release of the defendant in the complainant ' s slander, must be reorganized, reports the press regulator.
The New Express, published in Guangzhou, made an unexpected public statement requesting the release of journalist Chen Junzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken the lead in writing false articles about a company with a public share of property.
Now, the New Expression must go through “the process of complete correction of errors”, as the regulator says.
The error management order came from the Guandun Office in the areas of press and publications, radio, cinema and television.
The preliminary investigation showed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group of the New Express published several false reports about the Zoomlion Stock Exchange from September 2012 to August 2013.
“The New Expression Editor’s manual was disoriented,” said the regulator’s statement.
He reported that the decision had been made to “use the administrative recovery of Chen Junzhou in the form of a withdrawal of his reportary licence”.
He also “instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to correct complete errors in the “New Expression” and recommended that it conduct an investigation into the situation of the newspaper’s responsible persons and to make immediate changes to the “New Expression” guideline”.
Mr. Chenh wrote several articles for the New Express, which stated financial violations in the construction equipment of a company called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his newspaper published two appeals for his release on the first floor, claiming that he supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on public television, recognizing that he had published false money articles.
“In this case, I damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news industry and its ability to earn public confidence,” he said to CCTV’s public broadcaster.
I did this mainly because I wanted money and glory.
I realized my fault.
After his confessions, Mr. Chenya “New Express” issued an apology for the first floor, claiming that the paper was not able to properly verify his reports.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects were admitted on TV.
Experts say that China ' s recognition practices are still widespread despite recent amendments to the laws prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to make a self-response.
U.S. Tunnel — Mexico for drug-related drug-related drug-related crime
One of the most complex drug-trafficking tunnels between the United States and Mexico has been found with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
The U.S. authorities described the four-foot tunnel as one of the most complex secret trails they've ever discovered.
This tunnel, which has a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near the city of Tijuana (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
This area is filled with undetectable warehouses, which facilitates the hidden loading of drugs in the truck.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were accidentally remanded, as the authorities said.
According to the court documents, the lawyers confiscated eight ton of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when finding the tunnel.
Three men who, according to law enforcement officials, had been charged with the possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
In the event of conviction, they are threatened with imprisonment from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is an eighth major pass, found in San Diego since 2006.
Several major tunnels were found in Central Mexico after the harvest of marijuana in October, which placed a difficult challenge on drug cartels to deliver their products quickly to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of some 700 yards, equipped with relay routes, from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two San Diego warehouses.

British police handing Assanju a notice of extradition
The British police today issued a notice on the extradition of the founder WikiLeaks Julian Assang, who hid in Ecuador's Embassy in London and sought asylum.
In Scotland, Jordan stated that they had given the 40-year-old Australian an “official requirement to surrender” with a requirement to appear at the police station, adding that in the absence of such a requirement, he would continue to be arrested.
Assangu threatened to be extradited in Sweden on sexual crimes charges after he exhausted his opportunities under British law, when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would transfer it to the United States, he hid in Ecuador's Embassy in London on 19 June, requesting political asylum in that South American country.
Scotland-Yard “has given a 40-year-old official requirement to surrender, which obliges him to come to the police station day and time at our election”, the press secretary reported.
He continues to violate the conditions for bail-off.
The Embassy refused to comment on the notification of the police.
Assang is afraid that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to make possible charges in espionage after the publication of more than 250,000 US diplomats on the WikiLeaks website.
Driver speeding 130 miles per hour with hot drinking between his feet, fined £1000
The driver was charged £1000 for driving at a speed of up to 130 miles per hour (110 km/h) with a hot drink held between his feet.
35-year-old Andrew Howy of Tiptri, Essex, was observed as a member of his Mercedes Benz on the A120 track in Braintri on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink on his leg.
In the world court of Colchester Houi, he acknowledged the charge of leadership without due care and attention.
The addition to his driving licence of seven criminal bullets led to a six-month driving ban.
Howi also had to pay the cost of £90 and the additional cost of assistance to victims of crime of £100.
Tax for foreign real estate owners will cause the London bubble to collapse
The Treasury has carried out a preliminary assessment of the capital increase tax measures, but expects a final decision by Mr. Osborn, who in the 2012 budget introduced a public tax rate of 7 per cent for houses worth more than £2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own houses in the company rather than as individuals.
At this point, housing in the Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea areas of 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 financial year already exceeds the total amount for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and Hamber together.
Mr. Cook said: “After increasing hospitality to expensive homes and the introduction of related legislation against the removal of expensive property, it is very difficult to claim that taxation is reduced regardless of the impact of the old municipal tax system.”
“But this may lead to some foreign investors reluctant to buy real estate in London or its current owners will not want to sell it,” he added.
The value of the first-class real estate, above 5 to 10 per cent of the priced housing market, grew to 11.8 per cent of the record last year in the well-known south-west zone of London, which extends from Fullham to Wimbledon.
According to a study by Savillas, prices in the centre of London continued to show sustainable growth of 5.6 per cent per annum, but they were obscured by the active development of the market in the south-west, in the north (7.4 per cent) and in the east (6.5 per cent) of the city.
Scientists shed light on how the dog’s tail movements are related to its mood.
More early studies have shown that satisfied dogs push tails to the right side (from the dog's point of view), while troubled dogs push tails mainly to the left.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family may notice these subtle differences in tailing and react to them.
Professor George Vallortigar, neurobiologist at the University of Trent, said: “It is well known that left-wing and right-wing people have a different role to play in forming positive or negative emotions”.
This is where we tried to look at this and other kinds of things.
He added that, like man, the right part of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and two half-story plays different roles in emotions.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the various variations in the tails of other dogs, researchers observed animals when they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of animals and analyzed their behavior.
Maybe we'll soon figure out why their tails sometimes go to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Valortigar said: "We showed dogs videos with dogs, either naturalist versions or silhouettes, to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate tail movement and drive tail more to the left or to the right."
When the animals saw that in the rest of the unexpressed dog, the tail was moving right (from the point of view of the tail of the dog), they were totally weakened.
But when they noticed that the tail had shifted mainly to the left (again in the direction of the rising tail of the dog), their hearts began to tremble, and they looked anxious.
Professor Valortigar said that he did not think the dogs were willing to communicate with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience what movements they should be concerned about and what they should not be concerned about.
He notes: “If there are several meetings with other dogs and their tailing is often linked to more friendly behavior and the right of the party gives less friendly behaviour, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of the emotions of their animals.
The expert on dog behavior John Bradshaw, an invited scientific officer at the University of Bristol veterinary school, said that it was not the first study to check whether it was relevant to the left dog and the right of the party.
Last year, a group of scientists from Lincoln University found that dogs were turning their heads left if they looked at an aggressive dog and right if they looked at a pretty dog.
In another scientific work at Victoria University, Canada, he reported: “The dogs were more likely to approach the dog at work when its tail was pushed to the left rather than to become alarmed, contrary to Italian research. ”
He said that differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully accept animals in films or dogs as dogs.
It could be useful to study how dogs react to these dogs, he explained.
“While there is sufficient evidence that two brains are used for different purposes, many details are still to be clarified and dogs are not excluded,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior may be recorded, we may soon understand why their tails are sometimes directed to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys are giving a concert in Glazgo because of Alex Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock group postponed the concert in Glasgow after her vocalist was diagnosed with larynx.
The lead group was to be in the City Concert Centre of Hydro on Friday.
However, Alex Turner’s vocalist disease forced them to take over the show.
This group statement was made after it had been forced to hold a concert at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official Arctic Monkeys website, they said: “After taking a decision on the transfer of the show to the Burmese LG Arena tonight and after treatment with Arctic Monkeys, the show should also be postponed to the Hydro Square in Glazgo on Friday, 1 November.”
“Alex Turner was diagnosed with laryngitis, and unfortunately he is unable to speak.”
The show at LG Arena in Birmingham will be held on 20 November and the show at Glazgo will be held on 21 November.
All the tickets for the show are still valid.
We want to apologize to all the ticket owners for any inconveniences they may have caused.

Pope Francis called the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will lead the new cardinals of the Catholic Church to the dream for the first time in his service on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they choose the pope, so that Francis will appoint his first group of people who will eventually participate in the election of his successor.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching the 80-year-old cardinal, he could no longer participate in the pope’s election, which is the prerogative of group 120 “cardinal electors”.
In announcing this news, the Vatican Press Secretary Father Federico Lombardi said that before the ceremony, a meeting of all current cardinals, known as a consortium, would be held.
“Dad Francisk decided to inform in advance of his decision to convene a consortium in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving cardinals from different corners of the world,” Lombardy said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voting Organization said that by February the number of cardinal voters was likely to decline.
He said that the pope usually calls as many cardinals as it takes to bring back the number of cardinals to 120, as well as as as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wishes.
Consistency will be of great importance next year because it will be the first since the election of France in March of this year, according to Valero.
At this point, there is a kind of advantage in favour of Europe and in particular in favour of Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if a new cardinal pope from other regions of the world is appointed to restore the balance”, he said.
In South America, 40 per cent of Catholics live, but they are represented by no number of cardinals.
These will also be the first selected cardinals since the establishment of the French Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, who have been commissioned to search for ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad decided everything on his own.
"Now France has chosen eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that it was “possible”, that France would address the cardinals after the council.
But we have not been in that situation before — all of this for the first time.
Valero said that the popes were usually taken to the cardinal of the bishops from large incomes, but the French “polo surprises, so we don’t know who he is calling. ”
GM detects a number of new U.S. pickups to complete the seat back
General Motors Co reports nearly 19,000 new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 models to address the problem of manual regulation of seat backrests, as reported by U.S. regulatory authorities on Friday in the field of road safety.
On some of the pickups, front seats may have a defect in the rear inclination mechanism.
As a result, seats do not conform to the federal safety standards of road transport by head restraints.
“In the event of a car crash behind the head of the vehicle, the driver and passengers may not be adequately protected by increasing the risk of injury,” says the National Road Safety Administration website.
These models were produced from 1 August to 10 September.
The GM pick-up started in June and is the most important start-up of the car in the series for the leading American auto manufacturer since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the peaks of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Administration could not consider notifying the owners of the 16-day termination of the Government, which reduced the growth of car sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were upgraded for a number of models in 2014, increased by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, as GM stated on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickup and 16,503 Sierra pickup.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 per cent on Friday until $37.47.
The cry of despair of Obama's electorate
I voted in favour of President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change
He said that Obama had allowed the obstruction of the Republicans to engage in no commendable effort.
Obstructionism cannot serve as a justification for problems with a web site reformed by the Health System Obama, the attacks of unmanned pilots
The 2008 Obama Campaign Memories are a sad reminder of what could be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-class medical student at Harvard University.
I read a terriblely sad book these days.
I thought that this book would inspire me during my second degree in medicine and give me a sense of hope.
It is called “Survey for Victory”, and it is a memoir of the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama.
When I end up writing reports about my patients and lying in bed at night, this book brings me back when politics inspired millions of people and talks could take the spirit.
The victory in the elections was impressive, and the leading news programmes were taking a break to think about this historic moment.
My classmates cried out with joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could only find.
The White House had to come to a young team of strategies, and the people were ready to change.
At the time of Obama's entry into office in 2008, his support level was 82 per cent.
Then I close the book.
The return to the present is a gross awakening as a withdrawal from the dream.
It is hard to remember those days of optimism — they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I left my first ballot, changes have indeed taken place.
That was what I couldn't even imagine.
I pay tribute to Obama for his great and varied achievements, from the adoption of the Act on Accessible Medical Assistance to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, to the repeal of the “Do not ask, do not speak”, of the murder of Usama Ben Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstruction has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, choice of public health and closure of the Guantanamo base among others.
But after a number of times, when I was on the side of Obama's administration, protecting her from colleagues and supporters, I ended up explaining what I could provide.
I have reached the point of political despair.
Obstruction of Republicans cannot explain permission for foreign leaders to be beaten by innocent children in other countries.
He could not explain the collection of data on the private lives of Americans by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of disclosors revealing the wrong actions of the Government.
He cannot explain the murder of American citizen Anvar al-Avlaki without trial and prosecution or non-compliance with the limits of public funding and expenditure during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the conclusions of the report, which states that the White House's efforts to silence the media are “self-aggressive... from the time of Nixon’s administration”.
And he has recently been unable to justify the failure to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the Access to Medical Care Act.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Did I have to understand at the age of 18 that leadership could be contrary to the political campaigns that preceded it?
It is clear that the work of the elected office is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be formed by an opposition political party and by random events such as the coup in Newtown.
Nevertheless, all the examples I have mentioned above show that they were largely their own choice of administration.
And that's what worries me most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was a field of enthusiasm for his candidacy.
Mitt Romni was an impenetrable and harsh alternative, and he did not seem to be able to decide on his own policies or views.
I thought that, in my second term, Obama, when he was released from the pressure of future elections, justified the hopes that we had heard for such a long time.
However, when Obama's rating fell below 45 per cent this week, it became much more difficult to return in 2008.
This makes me wonder at many of the promises that have come to pass.
This week, I read that part of the book describing how Clinton had defeated Obama in the initial elections in Pennsylvania.
At a meeting to analyse the causes of failure, he told his staff that they should return to normal and remain faithful to their goal.
"I want us to return our attraction," he said.
"We must remember who we are."
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I agree with you very much.

Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Ebbota has a conflict of interest in childcare leave.
Deputy billionaire Clive Palmer said that Prime Minister Tony Ebbota had a conflict of interest in the issue of child-care leave, because his daughters could get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mine industry magnet, which has an unresolved carbon tax dispute of $6 million, made this statement when it tried to get away from the question of whether it had a conflict.
The Palmer Joint Party may control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be crucial to the decision to abolish carbon taxes and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that the conflict of interest could only be with the ministers, and he said that Mr. Ebbota's daughters would personally prove to be a victory for political action.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid childcare leave, because if any of these daughters are pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they get leave or not,” said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the elections, the electoral commission officially declared Mr. Palmer a winner in the fight against the seat of Sanshain-Costa polling district, Fairfax, with a vote of 53 votes after the vote was re-elected.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the vote count procedure in the elections to speed up the process.
The daughter of Tony Abbot Francis and Bridget.
Should a decision on these elections be taken two months after we voted?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why don't we have this system so that you can come, put your data in the computer, immediately vote and get the result at 6:30 p.m. the same night?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of stamps in the bulletins.
That's because they can control the outcome if he doesn't like it?
It seems strange to use a candelabra in our time.
The Electoral Commission is exploring the possibility of an electronic vote and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59-year-old, said that his programme included an international airport for Sanshain Costa and would be “a matter of serious concern” for his new work.
The State office involves the service of society.
"We do not earn any prizes except through history, because at a critical time we can serve this district," he said.
RBS removes two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland temporarily removed two traders from its currency operations division, according to the information provided by the two people familiar with the situation, which is another confirmation that the global verification of the alleged manipulations in the currency market is rapidly taking place.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations involving the world's largest financial market, whose daily turnover is $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS officers to be removed during the decommissioning investigation, which is called a scandal related to interbank manipulations of the LIBOR rate.
By refusing to comment on the withdrawals, the Bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from the regulatory authorities this month.
“Our ongoing investigation is continuing, and we are fully cooperating with FCA and our other regulators,” the bank reported two weeks ago.
Last month, the informed persons said that RBS had transmitted e-mails and instant messages that had been received and sent by its former trader to the UK Financial Control Office (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left the RBS in 2010 and, as far as is known, he was granted a leave on his current post as head of European spot exchange trading in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the Citi European Spot Trade, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, the former senior currency trader in Barclays and UBS, was removed from work by Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders were charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher ' s Emergency Communications Unit included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, as reported by the informed parties.
The UBS bank reported this week that it had taken action against some of its staff after Swiss regulator Finma said that it was investigating alleged manipulations in the foreign market in several Swiss banks.
At least six world-wide regulators — the European Commission, Finland, the Swiss Antitrust Authority Weko, FCA, the U.S. Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Office — are considering allegations that bankers have entered into a dispute to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also started internal verifications or received requests for information from the regulatory authorities, said they knew the situation.
Banks have been looking for instant communications and e-mails for several years in search of offences.
The verifications have triggered traders in recent years as one of the largest sources of income for investment banks, which this year, however, has faced difficulties because the low volatility of the currency is lowering favourable opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the seriousness of the situation, saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate a large and high-liquid currency market, but senior traders say it is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trade in the currency market, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the wider use by banks of their domestic platforms means that “you can start to influence the market at a very low price”.
This news came on the same day as the Bank of Credit Suisse announced that he fired one of its London Stock Exchange brokers this week after it had caused a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately informed the relevant authorities and cooperated with its regulators.
“We are sure that the trader was acting alone and that the issue could be localized,” Credit Suisse reported.
The Supreme Court supported Obama's health law
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that the Obama Marking Law on Health was constitutional, which was a major victory for Obama's administration.
With a vote of 5 against 4, the judges decided that individual orders under the Patient Protection Act and accessible health care requiring citizens to obtain medical insurance before 2014 or pay a fine were constitutional in accordance with the authority of the Government on taxation.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, brought four more liberal members of the court, while the judges of Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy objected.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of this 2700 foreign law and further decided that the requirement for a health law to increase compliance by states with the requirements of the Medicaid programme, otherwise losing all federal funding of the Medicaid programme, was not constitutionally binding.
The application for blocking the bill had been submitted by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law strongly opposed each of the major Republican candidates to the Presidents during the 2012 primary election season, including the alleged candidate Mitt Romni.
Football - the reason for the difference?
In the framework of the Open Tribunal, politicians and experts spoke about how to maintain national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was the banning of football in the North Caucasus, because of this game, there were scandals and differences.
Speaker Sergey Nariskin recalled recent developments in Birjulev and said that policies and media should be correct in terms of reducing the "temployment rate" in society.
He probably meant a recent scandal with Vladimir Girinovski, who in one of the broadcasters threatened to surround the Caucasian with a ring of applause, if they didn't want to limit birth...
All speakers also spoke about measures to regulate migration from CIS countries and measures to harmonise relations between the peoples of Russia, which gave rise to controversy.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Birjulev were "the model conflict that could have been predicted", but "we have too many people and institutions responsible for these issues", and seven children without eyes.
The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe has been practicing for a long time for migrants, in the opinion of the public, has failed and needs to seek its way.
The historian Yury Petrov has placed great hopes in a new one-teacher of history.
"It is still necessary to create a history aid for the culture of the peoples of the country, so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know that they live in Dagestan, and on the contrary," he said.
Gennadius Zuganov suggested that he be charged with "calling for Russia's expulsion": "If you tell the US on the radio that Alaska should be given to Russia, you will be arrested and sentenced to 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Girinovski tried very hard not to burn.
As usual, he accused journalists throughout the world who posed painful and severe national problems for public debate: "In the middle of the debate, there is little to say!"
The leader of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Vasiliev, advised the journalists here to close the paper and agree to hold discussions on the subject in an accurate manner, and then the same commitments could also be made in politics.
We have passed about 30 laws governing migration, and in general, Mr. Vasiliev said.
As an example, he introduced a law that places regional and municipal authorities in charge of international peace in their territory.
But Lusmilla Andrichenko did not share this law: he did not have “clear perceptions of the adaptation of migrants, of their mechanisms and limits.
Thus, subjects will treat different levels of authority.
In addition, municipalities do not have the necessary staff to deal with such complex issues, there are no funds, and the methodological recommendations that they could use do not provide them with...
The head of the Committee on Nationalities, Gajimet Safaraliev, proposed the establishment of a special department called “Ministry of National Security”, which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valerie Tiškov, who led a similar agency in the 1990s, subsequently abolished, objected.
It is enough to have a special person at the federal level, a “minister without a portfolio”, to which one could be addressed if so.
"We're on the edge, the shells are falling apart, it's very important for representatives of different ethnic groups and religions to act together against provocations, and this work should be given decent information support," said the representative of the RPC on the links with the society of Tsavold Chaplin.
No State's neutrality with regard to dangerous ideologies, including religious, should be held in its opinion.
This is where Oleg Nilov put the discussion into an unexpected tone: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan still need to be sought, but they are pushed not on that path, not on that path," he said.
"Not the road" is the development of football: "The football player is beating the whole crowd, the flags are jogging, the friends are throwing stones at each other...
Maybe we don't need football like that?
There's another kind of sport - the regbi is called...
"There will be no equal in the world in this kind of sport!" said the baroness.
There will be no one to play in the reggae of Caucasian!
You're still driving them!
We need to know the national characteristics, so it's just like the Georgian Fireman to propose...
In Jaroslavla, there were representatives of the Moscow club who were distinguished by the wild behavior of the tribunals - during the local club.
Football will be banned all over the country...
The Head of the disciplinary supervisory committee of the RFS Arthur Grigoryanz reported that "Cuban" was fined 500 thousand rubles, transferring from the home a football correspondent "SE" Philipp PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions for the Red Cross Club were applied for the fire of the Dagestan flag by patients at the court during the 14th round match against Anji.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a member of the RFPL.
We've studied all the available materials.
For the wrong conduct of Cuban audiences, 500 thousand rubles are fined.
Against Google, Samsung, Huawei patent claims issued by Nortel
The Group, which has thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent claims against mobile phone producers, including Google, whose price it has exceeded for Nortel bankruptcy auctions on Thursday.
The Rockstar Consortium, which bought $4.5 billion of Nortel patents, filed claims for infringement of patent rights in the U.S. District Court in Texas v. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help compare key search words on the Internet with their respective advertisements, states the claim that Google's search business is the basis.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones working on Google's Android operating system, which is fiercely competing with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google proposed an initial price of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased the proposed price several times, eventually offering a total of $4.4 billion.
Lost the Nortel patent case at Rockstar Consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in which the patent library of Motorola was partly the determining factor.
“Despite the unsuccessful attempt to obtain an auction of patents that are the subject of the request, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” the court said.
Rockstar requires an increased compensation for Google losses, since he claims that the violation of Google's patent rights is deliberate, according to the claim.
In Egypt, the first freely elected president takes an oath
Muhammad Murcy took an oath, but the day of his celebration would hardly mean the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohammed Mubarak promised “new Egypt”, when he swore, became the first freely elected president of the country, replaced Hosni Mubarak, who was defeated 16 months ago.
At its inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth head of State in Egypt after the monarchy was overthrown some 60 years ago.
He swore before 18 black judges in black robes in the temple building on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of the ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are looking forward to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Mursi said during a ceremony in the direct air on public television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life — absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said Mursi, a 60-year-old American engineer from Brother Muslim, a fundamentalist group, who was most of the 84 years of its existence forbidden by an organization that served as a target for violent actions by changing governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and policemen, when Mursi arrived with a small cortege soon after 11 a.m. at the local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to welcome the new president, and, unlike the President's pump Mubarak time, the movement was stopped only for a short time to miss his autocolon on the usual reinvigorated road connecting the city centre with the southern suburbs.
Although Mursi was smiling as an uncharismatic “save wheel” of the Brothers, his personal prestige grew sharply since his victory and Friday speech, in which he tried to present himself not only as a candidate for Islamists, but also all those who wanted to bring the case to the end of the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak.
“Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Mursi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red gown, to the judges in the wooden panels of the hall where he took his oath.
Later, Mursy was sent to the University of Cairo, where he had to speak his opening speech.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra, which served as a State gym, during which he stood “silently”.
Military officer Feldmarshal Husain Tantavi was present.
His arrival was met with the slogan “Army and People — One Hand”, which scandalized hundreds of those gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908, the University of Cairo was the site of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Mursy took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, where there was a resurrection that ended the authoritarian regime of Mubarak last year, and promised to restore the powers of the President whose post was deprived by the military council that took action against the defeated leader.
But having agreed to take an official oath before the court, not before Parliament, as adopted, it is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
The word Morsi on Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
The special meeting of the Association of Tumeni Engineers was held on the basis of the Yalutorovi Automobile Factory.
In the course of the event, a new line was presented for the production of steel tubes.
According to commercial director Denis Gribanov, a marketing study was conducted in 2011 with the emergence of a new owner on the steel market in the Tumen region.
It has been found that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electric tubes per month.
Thereafter, a decision was taken to change the profile of the plant and to install equipment on it for their production.
More than 7,000 tons of produced products have been charged this year.
Investments in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubleys, said Dennis Gribanov.
In October, a new state was launched to increase the range.
The plant has a small tube profile, which is used for the domestic and small forms of construction and for the furniture industry as well as for the construction industry.
We plan to produce 50 thousand tonnes of production per year, which will account for about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumen region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of enterprise staff has not decreased - now it is 157, in plans for the purchase of new equipment - by more than 50 employees.
The enterprise is retraining and the necessary specialists are selected from the existing ones.
The next year, the introduction of a new long-term scrap aggregate has become a thickness of up to five millimetres, which will reduce the cost of the product, as well as another state, with a tube production rate of up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, enterprises are expected to develop the pipelines used in housing and Communism.
The company's management has the task of closing up to 70 per cent of the need for the Tumen area in this product.
The Deputy Director of the Investment Policy Department, Leonid Ostromumov, addressed the heads of production, advised more attention to modernization of machinery.
This includes forms of State support for industry, which include the reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of its lease.
This year, 150 million rubles have been allocated for these purposes, two thirds of which have already been lost.
The last commission, which will consider grant contracts, adopts documents from undertakings until 15 November.
In addition, the budget reimburses costs for the participation of local producers in international trade marks.
For the next year, the budget provides for 150 million rubles that can be used to compensate lease payments and loans for the acquisition of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated to the fairs, 3 million for energy conservation programmes.
Up to 72 million rubles are being reduced to repatriated and paid equipment made in the south of the Tumen area for the oil gas complex.
According to Leonida Otroumov, this form of support would in future cease, as it was the reason for the introduction of the tax on the acquisition of useful fossils, which oil companies had paid in the area budget.
They do not do so at present and subsidies become direct cost commitments in the region.
In this regard, the Government considers the priority of direct support for industrial enterprises rather than for the oil sector.
Budget assistance will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the oil situation.
The equipment they purchase is a competitive advantage for the South Tumen region industry, and it will be difficult to compete at the price of the Russian medium belt, where the lower labour force is.
In addition, there is an unclear question of the successor of the new owner of TNC-WR, Rosneft, who has not yet placed his orders on the Tumen companies.
The Agreement on the Implementation of the Uvat Project expires in 2013, and no applications for extension have been made.
South-area companies specializing in equipment for the oil sector are currently unable to form a portfolio of orders for the future year.
The question remains whether taxes from the oil source in the Uvat region will be paid to the region budget or whether they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the place of origin.
Tomic plays 240 hours for the extremist role in the socset
Tomska, the Lenin district court sentenced the city's residents to 240 hours of compulsory work, which had posted an extremist video network, told RIA News on Friday, a press representative of the district court.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man posted a video on his website in a popular social network, which was posted in a federal list of extremist materials.
In relation to him, a criminal case was instituted under the article “Acts aimed at incitement of hatred and hostility, as well as the humiliation of human dignity by the public”.
"The Lenin District Court has examined the case in a special manner and has recognized the man as guilty of the above offence by imposing a 240-hour penalty," said the interviewer of the agency.
She added that the man fully confessed his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians that the price of goods after the signing of an association with the Euro Union
The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Nikolai Azarov, was convinced that the country's prices would be significantly reduced after the country signed the Association Agreement with the European Union.
He said that during his conversation with the readers of his page at Facebook.
I can of course say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Thus, following the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Zone, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
And that would mean that prices should be reduced.
"This concerns goods coming from EU countries," said Azarov.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be focused.
However, there must also be no price increases.
Therefore, reports on billboards that have recently appeared enough in our country, that association with the EU is an increase in prices, not at all, or if more precise - not at all," said Azarov.
The investigators verify information on child abuse in Biscay
On 29 October, the media reported that an educator in one of the children ' s gardens in the city of Biesca had been held in a basement for educational purposes.
The investigators are now clarifying all the circumstances, as well as legal evaluation of the actions of childcare staff.
Evgenya Vasileva, after the charge of stupidity, spoke
The Evgenia Vasilev, whose attention has been paid to the media for almost a year, has not yet commented on numerous publications in the press, both on kidnappings in Minombo, and on it personally, on relations with former Minister of Defence Anatoli Serdukovi, its poetry and on the passion for valuables.
On 1 November, however, the Ombudsman ' s case violated the silence.
In an interview with Life News Vasileva, he said, "Of course, the task was exactly one: to extract from me any negative information about the former Minister of Defence."
There was a scandal that I had to give a witness, otherwise I was put in prison.
To this day, these threats have ceased.
We're going to court, we're going to prove our innocence.
We've got 100 percent confidence in victory.
In this interview, it can be concluded that Vasileu has said that she does not care about the taste.
It is likely that the statement by the official representative of the FC RF, Vladimir Markin, that the art collection, which was collected by the Oobsservis case, found the sub-departments.
Among the property seized are a number of paintings that the owner, convinced of his deep knowledge of art, acquired as the masterpieces of the world’s painting.
However, an artistic expert appointed by investigators after the arrest of these paintings found that they had no artistic value and were simply cheap undercover," Markin noted in early October.
Some pictures stolen from the Ministry of Defence...
Then they admitted that they weren't stolen from Minobara, and they said that I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
In my opinion, it's just a limitless thing," says Vasileva.
On the other hand, while admitting her guilt in one of the 12 criminal episodes she had committed, Vasileva said: "Of course not.
Admit nothing at all.
Moreover, there is no harm to the Russian Federation.
They're just misleading people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement by the FC, that Vasileva is avoiding the study of criminal matters, the figure lawyer stated that he and his client “the investigator does not get to know the material of the case”.
What was the reason for the revelations under Vasil's house arrest, still not associated with the press?
Perhaps how could she not respond to the accusation in a bad way?
Or the rights of journalists from Cosmosmolki, who claimed a few days ago, that she had "falled into an even greater trance under house arrest" because of the reconciliation of Anatolia Serdjukov and his return to his family?
A well-known KP military observer, Victor Baranec, in his article "Serdjukov returned to the woman?" wrote: "The investigators do not rule out that after such a shock, she may become more talkative in questioning."
In the past, Vasileva had charged himself with some of the illegal sale of the properties of Mino-Debate.
Preludedant guys.

Do you think the tourists left in the past with the Internet?
The Flight Centre seems to have a reverse trend.
The company has updated its income forecast in full year and expects record revenues from vacationers in Australia and Britain.
The tourism company now expects its main annual income to be from $325 to $340 million, compared to the previous forecast in the range from $305 to $315 million.
If the current guidelines are achieved, this will be a 12-17 per cent increase compared to the record income of $290.4 million received in 2011/2012.
The Managing Director, Grem Terner, said that Flight Centre had received 8 per cent of the first half of the year and had started the second half of the year with good indicators, especially on Sunday trips to Australia and the United Kingdom.
“For the period from the beginning of the year, we are working on income in our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to receive a record high income for the full year before deducting interest and tax contributions,” he said.
- This is Australia and the United Kingdom, which usually brings us the greatest profits."
In Australia, business in the field of leisure in the second half of the year recovered, which offset a slightly weaker internal market for corporate travel.
Similarly, the business of the Flight Centre in Britain in the field of leisure was doing well, while corporate customers were spending less.
Her business in the United States offset the losses suffered during the season of the weak first half of the year and was expected to receive income in the third full year on the spot.
Flight Centre shares grew 3 cents yesterday until $38.20.

In Ekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies
In Ekaterinburg, the police are investigating a criminal who has been brutally quarrelling with two sisters.
After the murders, their bodies burned.
As reported to the "New Region" in the press service of the U.S. IMF in the Sverdlovska area, two women were found in the Uralska capital area earlier the day after the fire was extinguished in a three-room apartment located in a residential home on Uralska street.
The persons of the dead were soon identified.
It was found that this sister, one of them, was a resident of Ekaterinburg 44 years old, the second was a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg area.
The hottest apartment they took off a few days ago.
His investigation was conducted by Michael Borodin, the chief police force.

In addition, it is established to what extent women had withdrawn their apartment and where they had lived before what they had been dealing with.
Schools called for more attention to mathematics, orphography and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one Shakespeare play, the 19th - century novel, the romantic poetry, and modern British artistic literature since 1914.
The examination will also provide “non-programme texts” to encourage more extensive reading.
The joint course of English literature and language will be abolished.
Since 2015, students will be required to submit a separate language exam, with strong recommendations for the selection of English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education should issue new training programmes in English and mathematics tomorrow, the first items under radical review.
It will make changes to other major items next year.
The separate regulatory body in the field of examinations OFQUAL will present the revised structure of the secondary school graduation exams, with a new evaluation system and a lower level of course work.
In the summer, Minister of Education Michael Howe said that there would be “a broad consensus that we should reform our exam system to restore public confidence”, insisting that school graduation exams would be “more complex, more ambitious and more rigorous”.
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics (116 hours per year or 3 hours per week during the fourth period) than in most countries.
To compare, Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, and students work in Singapore about 138 hours.
Although the formal requirement to spend more time on mathematics is not available, the coalition sources said that large school graduations on mathematics in conjunction with the higher rate in the rating table would be an incentive for schools to provide additional training on this subject.
The curriculum will focus more on “real life challenges”, including financial mathematics.
Tickets in Heikh will be served by tourists in 2,200 rubles
Tomorrow morning, from Blagovejvenska to Haye tourists will start driving ships on an air cushion.
For those wishing to attend China, this means additional losses
The ticket on the puma is traditionally worth much more than the heat.
As reported in AmurASSO's reference service, the value of the usual ticket is 2,200 rubles.
The trip through the comfort room will be 2,800 rubles.
In fact, the season did not allow the ticket to travel: at the same price, the pumas drove tourists and the past spring, and the year back in autumn.
Dmitry Medvedev: GDP growth rate is not sufficient for the development of the State
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers that the growth rate of its GDP is insufficient for the RF and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying business lending conditions and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, Reuters reports.
We planned a GDP growth in the area of 3% this year, maybe even hear more.
It'll actually be less than 2%.
In view of the recession in a number of European countries, it would not be very bad, but it is small for us, because the economic base is not as powerful as in a number of countries, and in general, to develop, it must be at a higher rate.
It is now very important for Russian companies, the Russian business, to receive normal loans at a normal price, which is the first thing that must be done," stressed the head of the Government.

Journey through the rivers, rivers and jungles to provide free medical care
Dr. George Bwelle provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Bwelle and his team run almost every exit, taking hundreds of patients
Not so many doctors in this West African country — only one per 5,000 people
Vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. George Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN heroes in 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 major heroes to make him the Year CNN.
This person will receive $250 000 to continue his outstanding work.
During his 21 years, George Bwelle saw his father return to life and regain his unconscious condition, looking for hospitals that had not been properly equipped to help him.
James Bwelle suffered a car crash in 1981 near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but the infection spread to the brain and called for a hematoma that had been remembered for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said George Bwelle.
If we had the money, we'd get him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle accompanied her father for years in overcrowded clinics and hospitals with any treatment they could receive.
"It's not easy," Bwelle said.
- You can leave home at 5:00 a.m. to go to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Father Bwelle died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor in Cameroon for 5,000 people.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413.
And even if the cameramen could contact the doctor, many of them wouldn't be in the carnival.
Two out of five people in that country live in poverty, and nearly three-quarters of the cost of health care is private.
“Their only problem is poverty,” Bwelle said.
“And because of poverty they are unable to enjoy their lives.”
Seeing his father's suffering and many of his fellow citizens, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. George Bwelle and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and worked as a paramedic surgeon at Yaounde Central Hospital.
It also established an ASCOVIME non-commercial organization, which organizes visits to rural areas to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people are loaded in vans, tied to the roofs of medical facilities, and headed to the intersections to visit the village ' s needs.
They don't always have luck.
Sometimes they had to push their cars through rivers and bridges.
But when they come, they meet them like these heroes: this is a party with songs and dances and the best rooms that locals can only offer.
Free health care in these villages is indeed a occasion for a holiday, and Bwelle, with its wide smile and unlimited energy, is more than happy to join in.
The next morning the brigade starts taking hundreds of patients.
"We take 500 people on each trip," Bwelle said.
They come from all the districts within 60 km of the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these outpatient clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive a gift, a gifted eye, or a free birth certificate — a document that many poor families simply cannot afford.
After dinner, the brigade conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in schools, municipalities or at home; after the procedure, patients stand up and go to the post-operative zone to free up their place for the next person.
By using a generator to illuminate the operation and sanitation of the equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers are working until early Sunday morning.
This is a slow pace, but the brigade’s zeal usually helps to support village musicians.
"They beat us all night in the drum to keep us up and running," Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the brigades return to the city, tired but proud of their work.
The group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations last year, and they know that their assistance may be of great importance to those they assist.
One man explained that his free care operation would allow him to work again.
"This will change the future for me and my family," said the man.
In addition to these clinical admissions, surgeon Bwelle also works nights in private medical clinics around Yaounde.
It is this second job, he said, that provides 60 per cent of the financing of its non-commercial organization; the other funds are covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's asleep," said Katie O'Malley, a medical student at the Second School of Drexel University in Philadelphia, volunteer at the Bwelle Group.
He's always in the hospital or he's trying to make money for the organization so that these campaigns can be continued.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Bwell, this is an opportunity that they would never have had at home.
“We have been given the opportunity to assist in operations where we have helped remove five bloods or keep the tools for Dr. Bwelle,” O’Melli said.
As a high school student, you'd never get that opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon, often coming with donated medicines.
But upon arrival in Yaounde, their food, transportation and training pay Bwelle.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Malley.
He gave his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon endlessly.
For Bwell, the almost permanent burden of work is not a difficult test.
To help others live a happy life, to fulfill this promise to their father is what brings him great joy.
“I am so happy when I do this work,” Bwelle said.
- And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh to ease their pain.
Go to ASCOVIME and see what you can help.
Snouden agreed to give evidence of Merkel's pardon.
The Bundestag's deputy, Hans Christian Strebele, met with Edward Snowden in Moscow.
During the discussion, the question was raised whether Snouden could be questioned as a witness to the FRG's Geneva in the case of a possible interception of the German chancellor's phone by U.S. Special Forces.
Snoudden was willing to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could be held either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear, said Hans-Christian Strebel, that he knows a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency led by China Alexander has blocked all its movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, all conditions of his arrival must first be clearly defined.
Meanwhile, American lawmakers are beginning to take action in response to the scandal around US spy programmes.
Yesterday, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved a bill imposing additional restrictions on the activities of the American Electronic Intelligence Authority.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all areas and areas.
According to reporters, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus Vladimir Makei at the press conference following a meeting with Turkey's Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, the correspondent of BELTA reported.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in the development and deepening of the Belarusian-Turkish relations in all areas and areas.
Belarus is also interested in this, so we have agreed that the public administrations of the two countries will provide all-round assistance and support to entrepreneurs that establish direct trade and economic contacts between themselves," said Vladimir Macei.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all the necessary conditions for this and provide maximum assistance.
The Minister also reported that there was a regular 8th meeting in Ankara of the Belarusian-Turkish Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission, which signed the Protocol.
The parties drew up a road map of Belarus-Turkey cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy department, aims at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade, economic and investment areas, in the fields of industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy and new forms of interaction.
"The protocol of the last meeting was fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey view each other as reliable partners," he said.
Turkey's Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, reported that during the negotiations, the heads of the foreign political agencies of the two countries decided to continue to develop mutually beneficial cooperation and to implement various projects.
The trade between Belarus and Turkey, in the Minister's view, needs to be increased and brought to $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in the area of investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, as there is unused potential in this area, he believes.
There has always been a very warm relationship between our countries, and we hope that they will further strengthen and expand.
All necessary conditions will also be created for trade and economic links and for the successful work of Turkish companies in the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey," Ahmet Davutoglu noted.
Obama rejects his words of health
In the midst of a critical storm, President Obama yesterday went to the fifth of his frequent, unanimous promise that “if you like your medical insurance plan, you can keep it.”
Since hundreds of thousands of people have been notified of the termination of their services from their providers, the Republicans have in recent days criticized the President for introducing American society into error.
Obama failed his original public promise yesterday.
“Most people with medical insurance that works can keep it,” he said in his statement in Boston.
With regard to what he called “recreation in the news”, Obama urged those receiving these notifications to look for other options on the market.
Most people will be able to obtain better comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
“You’ll get better conditions,” he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5 per cent of the people who buy insurance on their own might be forced to change their plans because their coverage did not meet the new standards required by the Law on Accessible Medical Assistance.
"Let me tell these Americans directly: you deserve the best," Sibelius said in a statement to the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sibelius, who advocated the implementation of the Act on Accessible Medical Assistance, said that the launch of the Internet sales site was “wonderful” since October.
“ I’m upset and upset just like everything else, ” she said.
- I really want your trust back."
The angry Sibelius defended this phrase, which was captured by the included microphone, who was sitting behind her at yesterday's hearings in the Chamber after a heated debate with a member of the House of Representatives Billi Long, a Republican of Missouri, whether she was obliged to join Obama's health programme herself.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long urged Sibelius once again to say why the “archittor” of the accessible medical care law did not voluntarily renounce the Government-sponsored insurance to acquire a plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
Rosbalt Agency Disappeared Media Status for Uncensored Defense
On 31 October, Mosgorsud decided to accept an invalid license for the registration of the agency "Rosbalt", says "Lenta".
The lack of media status of the agency urged Roskonadozor to systematically and brutally violate the media law.
During the trial, an unpleasant precedent was created: the court considered it possible to close the media, in fact refusing to issue any counter-arguments.
What's "Rosbalt"?
The Rosbalt Information Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In subsequent years, the Agency opened the second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agencies also work in representations in the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and functioned as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency had listed Russia's most well-known private media networks.
However, Rosbalt has always been quite specific: the core of the agency's exclusive publications has been (and still is) a note referring to the sources of law enforcement.
Discussions on the proximity of the publication to force structures continued throughout the Agency.
In addition to the fact that Rosbalt had an extensive source base in various departments, it was also in favour of such assumptions that Natalia Chaplin, the wife of Victor Churchesova, was in the head of the project.
However, the role of Chaplin in the Rosbalt leadership is unclear: it is most often referred to as the project manager.
The Director General of the Agency is Larissa Afonina, chief editor-in-chief, Nikolai Ulyanov.
In recent times, Rosbalt has not been included in federal media ratings, either by quote or by audience.
In October, the agency took the 25th place in a Russian media website rating on LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the rosbalt.ru website’s Wednesday audience is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand visits), a monthly audience of about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the past five months are the comments on Kremlin's insanity in relation to Ukraine, the death of a soloist group "King and Shot", the funerals in Brussels.
The Rosbalt conflict with Roscondasor began in July 2013, when an amendment to the Media Act was introduced, prohibiting journalists from non-censored protests.
The notice found a forbidden lecture in two of the video agency's website ("Jaghit of Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot have desecrated oil spills").
The parties further describe different.
Rosbalt was accused of gross and systematic violations of the media law on the basis of the found video material and appealed to the court to select a licence from the agency.
In Rosbalte, claims were alleged to be incorrect: first, the roles were not editorial material, second, the mother's words were masked in them, and thirdly, immediately after the role was warned, the site was removed.
The Agency ' s representatives complained about the claims of Roskonnaszor in the world court, and when Mosgorsud adopted the request of Roskonnaszor on 22 October 2013, these complaints were still ongoing.
However, 25 world judges have already taken a decision not in favour of Rosbalt: the editor-in-chief, Nikolai Ulianov, has been found guilty of a violation of the Code of Administrative Offences and has paid 20,000 rubles for each role.
Obviously, this predestined the outcome of the Mosgord hearing - if you refuse to think that the outcome could have been predestined earlier.
On 31 October, the Court decided to accept the invalidity of the Rosbalt registration certificate, de facto denying the status of the media agency.
You can't say "Rosbalt" remained alone during this opposition.
The Agency supported Members of the House (a statement by the head of Roskonnaszor Aleksandra Gharov signed 26 Members on 10 October; the document itself was submitted on the initiative of CRC).
The publication's closing was not fair, statements were made by the head of the Russian Journalists' Union of Allevold Bogdanov, the President of the Moscow Union of Journalists Pavel Gusev and the head of the Presidential Human Rights Council, Michael Fedotov.
Furthermore, according to Bogdanova, the Roskimandozor leadership has even provided him with some assurances that the case will not come before the licence is withdrawn.
The Rosbalt court has shown that the media in Russia is more secure in its jurisdiction today than in Russia.
Syria destroyed chemical equipment
Syria destroyed all declared chemical weapons, recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament was completed by the day before the deadline.
By 1 November, Syria had to destroy production and other support facilities intended for the preparation of combatants for use, the Bi-bi-si reported.
The destruction of the poison stocks themselves or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of OPCW, toxic substances are currently in sealed storage sites.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people died in a chemical attack on 21 August.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for the mixing of chemicals and ammunition.
These productive capacities will now be carefully monitored so as not to allow them to do so.
The next wave is mid-November: by now OPCW and the Syrian must agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stockpiles of toxic substances.
There's a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide this equipment?
All Syrian statements will be carefully verified by Western intelligence.
They are willing to advise inspectors on new inspection facilities if there is reason to suspect that Damascus is not fully disclosed.
It is estimated that this shot was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the case of the Syrian rebels.
The world community has demanded the Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached through Russia, to destroy or irreplace all the power for the production of gas and liquids and for the filling of shells with these substances.
Now that this phase is completed, the next step must be the destruction of the already existing Syrian army of chemical weapons.
This arsenal may contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve-paralytic toxic substances, natural gas and other prohibited chemicals in several tens of different locations.
It is necessary for the OPCW and the Syrian authorities to agree on a timetable for action to begin with two weeks.
The Head of Field Operations of the OZHO Jerry Smith said that his inspectors had been “supplying the destruction of equipment”.
“They now have no opportunity to produce or mix chemical weapons further,” he said.
The OPCW statement states that the inspectors have visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and are convinced that the plant for the production of shellfish and toxic substances is either destroyed or damaged.
The remaining two objects are too dangerous to carry out an inspection, as stated in the document, but the equipment was transported and checked by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the destruction of the chemical production infrastructure was “inexhaustible”, as work had to be done in the context of the ongoing conflict.
At the beginning of October, OZHO received the Nobel Peace Prize, but, according to Smith, it was time for inspectors to make a distinction between it and their work.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented confession that the United States espionage “has gone unfavorable far”
John Kerry demonstrated a reduction in the protection tactics of United States tracking programmes, making it unparalleled that in some cases US spying “has gone unfavorably far.”
The Secretary also acknowledged that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, that he was “on the autopilot” during Edward Snowden’s gruesome disclosures about the ANB’s spy activities.
These leaks have put the U.S. Government at the centre of the diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on video at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “No doubt the President and I, as well as other members of the Government, have actually taken up some of the things that are happening on the highway, because such an opportunity has already existed — both during the Second World War and in very difficult years of cold war, and finally, 11 September.”
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. Government to acknowledge that the United States had gone too far, but stressed that no rights had been violated.
He said: In some cases it is an unpleasant thing.
And the President is determined to shed light on this matter and to explain it to people, and he is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has a sense of abuse.
There is no blame on you concerning the innocent."
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the ANB had acted in good faith and that his tracking operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are working in a new world where people are willing to explode.
In the world, there is radical extremism, senseless and full determination to kill people, to blast people and to attack governments.
What if you were able to capture it, stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented the collapse of aircraft, the explosions of buildings and the killing of people, because we have been able to learn about these plans in advance."
Meanwhile, American legislators are moving to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged US espionage abroad and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counter-terrorism activities with the United States, the Chair of the Senate on European Affairs said on Thursday.
The Senator of the State Connecticut Chris Murphy said that he had been talking to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participation in anti-terrorism organizations because of disappointment over the note by the National Security Agency.
“For the interests of U.S. national security, it is indeed important for Europeans to remain our advocates for our common anti-terrorism efforts,” said the Morfi Democrat, who served as the first-time vice-chairman of the International Relations Committee of the Senate on European Affairs, in an interview with Washington.
“And I am going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these ANB programmes.”
The news that the ANB has collected millions of phone calls in Europe has deteriorated relations with some US allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were incorrect and reflected a lack of understanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and shared with the United States.
Other disclosures included documents published by Snowden showing that the ANA had been monitoring the mobile phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and about 34 other world leaders.
The Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has protected spy activities against allies as necessary and said it is a normal case on both sides.
In the light of this noise, Murphy said that his office was organizing a visit to Congress, which was expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that members of both parties and the two Chambers would be included in the delegation.
The names of other participating legislators should be ringed in the next few days.
He said that the travel programme was still under development.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the trip was to promote better relations, he said that some degree of “hardness from the best wishes” would also be shown.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people in the use of spy programs themselves for many years.
“While we can change our tracking programmes to better protect Europeans’ rights, they must also agree that we are not the only ones involved in intelligence activities,” Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry had to go to those exits in the Middle East and in Poland to address the hostility of the United States strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US intelligence.
The impact of prisoners on the new public observation commissions will be increased
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OEC) can adopt new compositions of the Public Observation Commissions (OEC) in 43 regions of Russia.
If a voting option is adopted, lobbyists will increase their influence.
ONCs are public structures that control the conditions of detention in places of detention.
The actions of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonida Razwozjaev, the riots in the Kokoya colony, are the result of the UNOC in most of the resonant incidents.
There is a struggle between human rights defenders and lobbyists.
At the meeting of the OPC Working Group on the Development of the OPC, I proposed that the experience of human rights should be selected.
"It has not been accepted, and lists have not been drawn up," says Valerie Bortev.
By Borstev, the current President of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, the universal structure of human rights defenders dealing with prison problems.
In the home of a Member of the Government of Jabloca, he had drafted a law governing the activities of the UNC.
The OPC Council should vote for the membership of the OPC in 43 regions of the country.
In 1800 vacancies were claimed by fewer than a thousand candidates, while in Ingushetia and in the Balkans, the competitions were unable to organize due to the lack of candidates.
OC promises to organize a selection of vacancies.
ONK Moscow is one of a few commissions with a competition, despite the fact that there will be 40 participants in a new composition instead of 20.
According to Borsteva, the current composition of the chair commission of 11 human rights defenders and 9 defendants, and the option of voting in the OPC, the ratio is changed from 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders were wanted to be on the board.
Therefore, the representative of the "God's Brotherhood" may be reintroduced to the new composition.
He was a member of the ONC for three years but never visited the prisoners.
Borzhev believes that the forces, by appointing their chairman, will be able to make human rights defenders unbearable, so human rights defenders do not exclude a collective exit from the commission.
In their view, the movement of silhouettes is coordinated by a member of the ONC, Anton Cvetkov, headed by the Russian Officers, an organization that advocates the interests of the force agencies.
"I don't eat the babies on the tape," said the RBK daily Anton Cvetkov.
He denied that he was lobbying for the movement of any lists and said that he was not going to prevent human rights defenders from visiting arrested opponents.
According to Cvetkova, he was not even interested in what list they are now voting in the O.P.
The publication of Borsh information is considered to be a form of pressure.
Possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change in leadership of the Chilean UN.
Its former leaders will be removed due to last year's copious riots.
In the Public Chamber, it was concluded that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of prisoners.
And here's the Rostova-na-Donu ONC. It can move from human rights defenders to the forces.
Out of the new lists "propal" the human rights defender-president of the local commission, one of his opponents turned out to be, despite the fact that in May 2013, the Federal Public Court excluded him from non-ethical conduct.
The lists of the Moscow and Growth Commissions in Borstev are considered to be the place for Kopeysk.
Hope of Toloconnik did not affect the ONC Mordov, which is considered to be "forced": the new composition wanted to become only one human rights defender, and it did not even adopt documents for the competition.
A member of the OP Council, Nikolai Swanidze, told the RBK daily that he had voted against the proposed list, as he was sorry for the situation in Moscow and Rostové-na-Donu.
He sent his position to other members of the council.
His colleague on O.P. Paul Gussev said he voted for, because he liked the proposed Moscow list.
The UNC lists were coordinated by the Deputy Secretary of OP Vladislav Grib, also a staff member of the FSIIN Research Institute.
The Grib told the RBK daily that he did not consider it proper to divide candidates for human rights defenders and referees and did not agree with the fact that the chairman of the commissions had sufficient authority to prevent the work of its members.
The Grib should not predict the outcome of the vote of the Board of OPCW.
If the proposed list is rejected today, a change will be made in the next few days.
Australian woman appealed against a prison term in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 prison sentences on the island of Phuket for a false claim that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed to a sentence and was released under bail.
Steve Bemford was initially recognized by the Phuket Provincial Court on 15 June as guilty of a false trial after the Thai police reported that a local taxi driver had attacked the night on Sunday, 10 June, while two other men detained her.
However, the video surveillance footage later found that she had returned to her hotel well after breaking up her relationship with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phouket police interrogated Bémford for two days before she recognized that she had manufactured this story.
Before the trial, she was held in local police stations.
Bemford was sentenced to a 15-day prison term in the detention centre of the general regime in the province of Phuketa, not in the adult women ' s prison.
She is a daughter of the former Australian League of Peter Tanx, who has been in the Foreign Ministry in Canberra for her daughter.
Tanks told Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “very concerned” with the welfare of their daughter and was waiting for her return to Australia.
“It’s obvious that it was an alarming time, but we hope that she will return home as soon as possible,” Tanks said.
Bémford appealed to his sentence and was released on bail in 50,000 B.C.E.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently on vacation in the Krabi resort in southern Thailand.
The legal sources in Thailand reported that Bémford was currently a local lawyer in Phukete, but warned that the appeal could result in a court increase its sentence by two years and allow her to be held in a prison for adults.
However, after the recent murder of Australian tourist Michel Smith in Phukete Thailand, he could also seek to restore his debased tourist image, which would lead to a justifiable sentence.
Roman Senchin is now in Paris at the presentation of his Roman "Eltischev", translated into French.
Remember, this novel became the finalist of the four prizes: "The Field of Light", "Russian Booker", "National Bestseller" and "The Great Book".
Last year, the author of this book was awarded the Prize for the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is an unquestionable leader in the generation of current 30 years and so-called proselytizers.
Almost every publication of its hard work on contemporary life stories and stories has sparked heated controversy among critics of various ways.
It can be claimed that the consolidated articles on the Prose and Publicism of Senčina, reviews of its books and journals create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the end of the 1990s to the beginning of 2010.
In the discussions on “one of the most controversial contemporary writers,” critic Sergey Chuprinnin said, most of the issues are that her participants understand the word “literacy” as they see the present and future not only of our vocabulary but also of our lives.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book has not been able to include most articles and reviews from regional media and blogospheres.
Analytical and review articles are usually given in reductions in the sections “Absases...”
