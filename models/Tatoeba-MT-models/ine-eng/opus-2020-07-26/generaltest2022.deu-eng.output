The product cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the product....
I'm #PRS_ORG# and so it's not a problem for me.
You only need a number or instruction that I should attach to the package so it can be taken back by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# for 249€ a few days ago.
Today it costs 179€.
I honestly think that is very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and re-order for the better price or do I have another option of credit?
I also find, in principle, that children should not be encouraged to take on a parental role for their little siblings.
However, I find that it is also good for large brothers to take care of the small ones.
Take a look at it, help it out, bring the bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help the family with and are involved.
As long as they can be enough of themselves, I don't see any problem.
If your K1 is busy for the short time alone and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can do the best you can for your children.
It's not like he's changing K2 and going to sleep for hours.
It's probably legal.
Maybe that's why the psychologist's statement comes too.
Because if something really should happen like a fire, collapse, earthquakes, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1, to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, your reputation;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember having read a Crimea / Thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost all the action, but I don't want to get part-out anymore, maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and therapy.
At the beginning of the story, an animal carer commits suicide by oversowing himself with feed and going to his predatory cats.
The case is taken by a Commissioner who, after a brief investigation of his therapists, is already operating a clinic where he treats patients with fear.
The Commissioner has a little thing that has a fear (before fire) and has landed in this therapist.
There is more killing and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is commissioned anonymously before every suicide to go to the site of the suicide and document and put the photos on the Internet.
In any event, it turns out that this therapist operates a type of underlying therapy group where a chip is implanted in the patient's brain, the one that suppresses the center of fear and finally puts the patient in the extremest way.
(A woman jumps out of the window another one goes for death)
This fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
At the end there's a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is so the gross act I am quite sure that the book was originally written by a French author/author.
If this action is known to someone or even someone can betray the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, well, I don't have the password for Wlan.
I need you to contact my husband first.
But it can take a while.
What steps do I have to take after this?
Is it also possible to recover the price difference?
Child, 4 j., Splitter under the thumbnail
The child, four years old, has over the entire length of wood splitter under the thumbnail (outside).
Have tried to pull him with a pint.
It's very hard to catch.
He didn't fit in and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
It's going to be a doctor tomorrow.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to drive upgrading
Always new Omikron cases provide politics and science in Britain.
Thus, until New Year, all qualified adults in England are expected to receive an award.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to get ahead even faster in the Corona seizures due to rapidly increasing numbers of omikron.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday night in a pre-registered video message to his countrymen.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in the parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omikron variant, one faced an emergency, which is why the protection of vaccination must be strengthened urgently, said Johnson.
The good news was that the level of protection with a third dose of vaccine could be increased again.
"Let it go!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 other Omicron cases were recorded in the United Kingdom, increasing the total number to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price at the time of collection?
I'm for everyone to come up with names
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by mail.
I want to answer the e-mail.
But unfortunately the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I lied to him and wherever he/she has a cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the e-mail now.
Can someone help me?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to keep any officials coming over my feet.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouncing.
It has a total of 5 books.
Four of them go.
It's just that one I bought today is not going
Apparently, the chair had a non-obvious flaw in its sales.
How can such a pulse damage occur after 9 months ?
Just trying on the #PRS_ORG#.
But it's been working since about.
14 days no more.
That's why I always bought the latest books on the site and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to order and take this into account.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content Warning: I will write something in detail here about domestic violence.
I just need to write something from the soul.
I (21) come in contact with the victims (and victims) for professional reasons more often than ever.
A topic that really bothers me, and unfortunately too often is too often that many victims are not allowed to help or think we could not help them.
I'm pretty clear that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation under four eyes, with the actor far beyond sight and hearing, I can't reach all of them.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of cancer, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of getting the kids out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone is, in part, very close to the tears, all are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it's never going to make it easier.
Please, always think that you are worth living without violence that is so incomprehensible.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What happens to the series "League of Legends"?
Many fantasy, many complicated names, a stunning discovery: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently been launched on Netflix.
Why do we look forward to the two staffs already announced?
Baseball League: Derby-Debakel of the MHP Giant Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick was released.
Nothing again: For the second time in not even three months, the giants lost in Craigsheim - and how!
In front of the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said with a look at the Pokal Depot in early October at Hacro Merlin's Craisheim: "We have some anger in our stomach."
But it didn't fall after the game - but it increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) - defeat in the basketball league.
With more than that naked result the manner of the performance disappointed.
Instead, it is called a statistics that expresses the whole dilemma: The trier quota was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all by young John Patrick) in saying and writing 31 attempts - more questions?
John Patrick replied: "We were simply not concentrated enough after the victory at Tenerife, and did not implement what we have trained".
That's to move the ball.
On the other hand, he reacted to Sebastian Gleim: "A noble game to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the lucky coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people before."
Only 750 visitors were allowed on Saturday in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they came at their cost.
Not least because of BBL-Topscore T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and driven the game of his team.
"The best gamemaker I've ever trained," Gleim said.
While in Patrick's team the performance carriers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebough (7) were defeated on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (2:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and reached up to eight points after they had already fallen to 39:59.
Next to John Patrick, Justin Simon came to 12 points.
Fortunately, a lot of time to hate doesn't stay.
Already on Wednesday (9am) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg maximum 750 spectators.
We used to have another email address, but I changed it.
Yeah, I already reported a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all guarantees were rejected.
We have been legally informed again, and therefore we have written them again.
We were first notified a year and a half ago.
Just like the egg pecked: Max Raabe becomes 59
He was able to inspire his audience with new interpretations of the 20th and 30th years of battle.
He is currently on his way with the program "Good Day, Dear Happiness" - if he may appear.
In fact, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But that's not going to happen.
The concert planned was launched in May 2022 - "on official instructions", in order to prevent the Corona virus.
Other of his performances planned in the Advent period must only take place once, as it is called on the singer's website, which will become 59 today, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
As of January, the artists want to follow up on their deadlines, which are already due to the pandemic in 2020.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalia Lünen, Max Raabe already sang a lot and enjoyed singing as a youth.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra together with fellow musicians.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of winners and songs in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded many awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "For Women It's No Problem" (2013) - the second place of the charts.
He made it out of the niche in the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair coming back and thinking about labels, Max Raabe from the current German music landscape is no longer to be thought of.
With the program "Good Day, Dear Happiness" he has been on tour. dpa since 2020

Federal Minister Klara Geywitz: There is no new apartment created by eviction
The new Federal Ministry of Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has voiced against the emergence of large residential groups, as was required in Berlin in a national decision.
"With an invention there is no new apartment, only the property structure changes," Geywitz said in an interview with the "day mirror" (Sunday).
My goal is to ensure that rents remain affordable in the coming years.
A colourful mix of private owners, associations or housing companies is, for example, the best protection against monopolies.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPDs, Greens and the Left Party wants to set up an expert commission, as is the outcome of the People's Decision.
However, if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not close the conversation with the FDP in the Ample coalition on further abbreviations in rental law.
The Coalition Agreement provides for a rental price brake by 2029, a limitation of rental increases in stressed housing markets and the extension of the rent level.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
However, if the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps", the SPD politician stressed.
Hello, I wanted to order something, and after a few days, I fell asleep that I forgot the last step in payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do they know when it will be ready again?
Or will it ever come again?

Well, that sounds great.
Then I'll solve myself with the new order.

At least 100 dead by Tornados in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, many tornados have been pulled by the United States.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be reported.
The images from there remind of a war zone.
During the night on Saturday, several tornados have set up serious deserts in the United States and may have demanded up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave about 320 kilometres of snow in the desert, especially in the Kentucky Member State.
His Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado was going, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just away.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is difficult to imagine that this is possible at all.
He alone counts Kentucky with up to one hundred dead in the Member State, the official numbers rising hourly.
Hello, I've just seen that she's sold out Vitrine #NAME#.
That's too bad.
Will it still be produced?
Or did she just get out of the range?
Is it possible to order this Vitrine in another country?
How long have you been reporting?
If delivery cannot be done in my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I just order the deck now and let them deliver to Germany that is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article via the contact form or gave up a return and wanted to ask whether it was achieved or processed, as I had not yet received confirmation.
Firms pay premiums and change advertising
While the Federal Government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination award, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees money prizes for vaccination.
They are thus on a line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccine calls - according to a German example - is also intended to increase the readiness to corona impressions.
He's changed into a company he read about.
That doesn't make his situation better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't even stick to his old place and looked for something else.
You can do that, too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: well, no matter.
He didn't find his job well, either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
This will then be legally relevant.
I'm doing a screen shot.

Help with First Own Campaign
Boron to the belly!
I just lead for a group of 4 friends the adventure over the grab pass and I want my heroes to lead seamlessly into a campaign written for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big bow is made to write the wicked weights and their motivations, the individual acts are invented, and now I am writing the entrant and stolpering over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a caravan of wheat from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran-Sea.
This is where further action is to be taken.
A few miles away from the village, the heroes are going to climb up a group of Goblins and lure them into a backseat.
I would like to give players the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: convince, act, threat, early recognition of the danger, whatever the players are facing.
Group strength: 8 common goblins, 2 with muscles, 6 with bends and cables armed
In the absence of notice, the Goblins race the heroes up in a caveway and flange to every three left and right bends to me the vehicle, while two with muscles stop the vehicle.
If it comes to fighting and the heroes are subject, I have two solutions
1. All the heroes are found unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village school.
Of course the career is gone.
2. Should a defeat be inappropriate just this half with two of his servants and comes to help the heroes in the fight.
The career's still there, everything's great.
How do you maintain your deus ex machine of solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an entry into the adventure?
The Goblins group will later play a decisive role, so it is not just cannon feed.
EDIT: wow, I didn't count on so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee many of your ideas and now I have more confidence in my narratives.
I built the lamp again.
And it's stuck together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send them back.
If you can get the back, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I'm born of Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the past season, the quality of the German Sky has gone down ever more, so I want to make some air with this post.
For the first time today, in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was interrupted to start the F1 report on time.
Although it was due to the late beginning and the start of the schedule far behind the planning, it would still have been possible to show the last ten minutes (planted) as well as the winning decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons the F1 has priority and therefore everything else must be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, mostly Sky UK has transferred the race to an end.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation of the serious accident well.
Then there was a rule in the F1 again with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so they didn't know that you could change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that gaps could change the tires when there were corresponding radio terms on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that there was this possibility for disappearances.
I believe that such basic rules should be known simply when you comment on the F1 at a pay TV broadcast.
It is also not the first rate of uncertainty, which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both simply have constant uncertainty on the subject of rules.
Generally not like the artificial comment-style of Roos, but say that the taste is.
But I really like Heiko water from RTL.
To this end, constant alberheits that simply make both unprofessional work, such as ordering coffee at (as well as unconscious) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Just the latter brings a lot of anxiety into the comment that he obviously does not take these seriously.
Not least, the advertising simply takes over with Sky, in which the only broadcaster who goes into the advertising is Sky, as you can listen to with F1TV, only the German soundtrack must come out without comment immediately after the race.
Neither ServTV nor ORF do that.
These two broadcasts also make training less advertising than Sky, and that as free TV broadcasters.
Even though you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages.
The remaining Sky Sport F1 program is also very smart and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking transmitter that transfers the F1.
Unironically, RTL makes a better job until advertising at the four races they can still transfer.
In any case, the great F1 season makes much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
On this: #PRS_ORG# pendant light, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and which is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an e-mail and she never answered.
Hi, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of these has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the substance has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Air pumps are excellently suited to provide an additional aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system over air carriers.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate all the systems.
If you have a large aquarium you can use pumps with 2 or more exits to connect several outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model air pump, but also offers to place an accent in the aquarium, for example with an air cover (you can find in our shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasured silence, a muscle or something like that.
The MK series has a special, soundproof design and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The air pump is connected by an air hose 4/6 mm to an neutron etc. and can be released.
The air pump should be equal to or higher than the water level and be placed outside.
If the fan pump is deeper than the water level, you should put a back valve between them.
Just cut through the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent if once the water would run backwards, which the water from the basin runs through the pump...
If the air pump is applied freely, you should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even if we specify here in ebay the processing time with 3 days, it will be packed daily and the packages will also be picked up daily here.
If everything is going well, it's going very fast.
We just want to avoid a little, so no one is right, just because it once lasted a little longer.
It would be like this, not everyone has an understanding for all the employees who also work in the shipping business...of course, here doesn't make a corona hold.
Please do not judge bad just because the delivery is delayed, which is only for the package services.
Of course you like to joke about these services, even if we say at the moment, they've got it damn hard.
This is also very different in the region.
Don't be mad at anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there are even better times.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without arms?
Can you also order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator to the world world
The daughter of the first American in all, a TV moderator and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday from the "New Shepard" missile system by Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under glowing blue sky Bezos took the freshly fried astronauts in high person after their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue rauman suit when he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and members of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed up and down and surrounded the Amazon founders.
According to Blue Origin, they were 10 minutes and 13 seconds away and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronauts, flying to all Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after which Blue Origin's rocket system was named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan was the honorary guests of the company, who had paid for their tickets the other four passengers: Space engineer Dylan Taylor, Investor Evan Dick, Technology Entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for her ticket, Blue Origin did not share.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission after the short flight.
He worked hard at his work and had to do everything himself.
She was just so scared, the 74-year-old said with a smile.
Michael Strahan, too, expressed his enthusiasm.
He'd love to return to everything again, the moderator said.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers high
The "New Shepard" missile system is largely automated.
During the flight away from the rocket, the capsule reached an altitude of about 100 kilometres above the earth, timeless before the reusable object was removed from large parachutes again.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts view the earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third all-mannered trip from Blue Origin: At first in July Amazon founder Bezos himself was aboard, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutch.
The second in October was the 90-year-old Canadian actress William Shatner, who was world-famous as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", along with the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics advocate Bezos and Blue Origin to advance the business with space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the good of mankind and regardless of the climate.

Someone who worked in biochemistry or studied biochemistry
I'm currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and I find this case quite exciting and I don't get upset in the lab (have already the inorganic chemistry practice behind me).
Of course, I have already informed myself before the study on occupational prospects, but I thought at the time, which I would definitely like to study until promotion and will be.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, and I am particularly impressed by the job prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you hear great job opportunities and the job is looked for in total, on the other hand you hear again and again from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That's why I'd really be interested:
1) What are you currently working on?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/content?
3) What have you studied/What training have you had?
4) Would you do all this again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really uncertain and superior to 2022, perhaps interrupting the study and making a training for specialist informatics.
If you have experiences there you also like to write :)
Extra stress before holidays & weekends
This topic came to my attention last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why it's just a little bit of a deal.
Not just before big holidays, like Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our business.
As it seems, there are also the days before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week it was Marie Heavenfart, which is called "Auffahrt" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is semi-official.
Last week, it was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So, what happened last week?
All over stress.
Lauter e-mails, who had to leave before departure, order here order there, everything *unconditional* before the long weekend.
Because... I because?
Because "the next week" sounds like so much time and that's not supposed to be it?
Or because people want to do as much in a short week as in a normal?
Not only was I upset on Wednesday then, but I was also very nervous.
What is this self-defense for holidays?
Then why do we still have a holiday if we can't afford it right?!
The stress did not come well from above, the colleagues were all so self-contained.
My question is simple here: are we the Swiss?
Is that our reformed-evangelism?
Or do you know that in the North?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) rejoices at Christmas in her Thuringian home - but still has no gifts.
"The beauty, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, is simply taken to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FPH.
She'll agree to the party by backing up with her son's pitches and bastele.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
Until the meaningful days, however, they have to do some more: "For the first time I have no gifts yet, I have to finally get rid of them."

NECTON-Bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NECTON-BIO gives the bird a smooth and shiny feathers.
The majority of pest damage occurring in the bird holding is due solely to food defects.
Since the feed consists of a protein-containing substance, it is a particularly rich and balanced protein diet for the formation of an undisputed spring dress.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses occurring during the mouse are due to poor or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the adverse ratio of amino acids in most plant feed products is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No further vitamins should be administered during the use of NEKTON-bio.
NECTON-BIO is cold water-soluble and can be delivered simply via drinking water or soft feed.
Thank you so much for finding it.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
DDR hand-work model Altbau E-Lock E 95 03 DRG/DR, the Lok was used in Schlesien and middle Germany, the very rare lok is probably derived from the remodelling proposal of model railway ME Heft 11/1968, used with play trails and parts see photos, function well, The series E 95 is a heavy-duty electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn Society (DRG) designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Schlesische network, possibly also originating from the small-scale company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Hall (Saale) and we are able to operate
In 1924 the German Railway Company had commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport 2,200 tonnes of coal trains and 530 tonnes of passenger trains at 45 km/h travel speed on this route.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as a 1Co+Co1' locomotive with a battery drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens sugar plants with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, the supply of six locomotives received the operating numbers E 95 01-06.
All survived the Second World War and then returned to the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946 the locomotives arrived as repair goods in the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnau improvement work Dessau, the value of processing of all six locomotives was established.
[4] In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were developed with the progressive re-electrification of the medium German network, while the other machinery was used as a replacement donor.
Initially, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 were built up in larger numbers.
Only when E 94 was to be considered that the number of processing could not be increased further, the E 95 came to the point of view of processing.
[4] The locomotives were first stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren railway plant.
They arrived at Halle P in 1960.
They were usually used in their own circuit plan in front of coal trains from the Geiselltal in the direction of Hall, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complex control of locomotives was problematic.
In this way, it was often assumed that shields remained glued to switch-actions.
Then the Beimann with Hammer and Holzkeil, constantly accompanying this locomotive, had to release the shield during the ride.
Damages to the motors often occurred and led to monthly accidents at the locomotive.
[5] Since sufficient new locomotives were available at the end of the 1960s and a significant extension of the electrical plant was not planned at the time, the railway could refuse to use old locomotives and most of the split-gates, leaving E 95 out of service.
In addition, they found that the Deutsche Reichsbahn Electrolocomotives only wanted to occupy one person, which would have caused a problem in the train operation due to the said difficulties with the machinery and the visual conditions of the driver.
[5] In mid-69 the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were postponed, followed by the last E 95 01, who left the service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 was therefore never used.
Until E 95 02, all locomotives were destroyed.
The E 95 02 was replaced by the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a soft heating plant on the main railway station Hall.
It took a while to convince the managers at the Reichsbah that the E 95 was a museum locomotive.
In 1979 the first external development of the locomotives began with the aim of presenting them to a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] It has since belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operable museum locomotive.
In 1986 the internal completion of the locomotives was carried out.
At the DB Museum Hall (Saale) the locomotive museum is maintained.
Since 1995, employees of the Bw Halle P tradition community have been working on the operational development of the locomotives.
In April 2015, for the first time, the locomotive was able to be presented to an exhibition in the Museum Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior painting, with the transformers being checked and five motors operating.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Schlesische Bergsbahn and the drifting sideways, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and the low maintenance load.
In February 1945 the machines were converted to the medium German network after Leipzig.
Main use area was first Schlesien

The middle bar is held by two feet, these are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The medium bar does not fit into the intended holding.
So I'm getting new sent.
When will they be sent forth?
No flats.
These are, according to the assembly instructions the right of the form, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
Main thing they fulfill their purpose
With me they're not flat

Hello #NAME#, shall I explain the problem to you again?
Household fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people were easily injured in a fire in a home in Oberbayern.
In addition, an estimated damage occurred in the six-digit euro area, as the police reported on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the neighboring residence in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were sent to the hospital on Sunday with light smoke poisoning.
The exact thing about fire was not known at first, but the police did not go out of a intended fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But it will come much later
And I have to pay the shipping costs again.
To unlock Fake News - Bientech-CEO release Impf-Photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021
Biantech-Chief Uğur Şahin had not so far made public his status of immunisation.
The company now published a photo showing its corona impression.
The illness of a friend moved him, Shahin told him.
The CEO and co-founder of the Biontech Mainzer Company, Uğur Şahin, published a photo showing how he receives a vaccination against the Corona virus.
In the social media there was false information that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," Shahin wrote on Friday in an article in the network "LinkedIn".
"For a few months, friends have forced me to post a photo of me on which I will be vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
He has so far rejected this because the communication should not turn itself around.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply upset when I learned that an old school friend of mine was currently fighting for his life.
He's been fighting a serious covid-19 disorder and has been hanging on a beat-up device for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Shahin continued to write.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often cut down by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear only makes it difficult to fight facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with the German Welle, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was produced in December 2020, as did the Deutsche Welle himself.
"I am legally not allowed to receive the vaccine itself at the moment," Shahin said.
There is a priority in Germany in the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, the prioritisation has been lifted for a long time - and the Bientech Chief has been able to impress himself three times.
Fire in a power plant: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in Nordrhein-Westfalen, the light went out on Friday evening: no electricity left and in many cases no heating.
A fire had set up a fire-fighting station.
After a fire with severe damage at a voltage station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg-Creis in North Rhine-Westphalia have to come out for about 24 hours without electricity.
By the fire on Friday evening, 41,000 affected residents and residents in several municipalities went out the lights.
The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday many emergency units were in operation until the large-scale disturbance could finally be completely repaired in the late evening.
Firefighters and assistants of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered services in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The provider thanked the people concerned for their patience and for their use by the helpers.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank ourselves for the affected municipalities, the circle, the firearms and the THW for the tireless use," said the chief of the area of primary technology, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz monteurs were able to start some pipelines only temporarily back into operation, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire according to company data.
Current stream flows again
The fire that broke out on Friday at 19:15 p.m. according to Westnetz at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid station severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switch system.
Heavy cleaning and repair work is needed there.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000 volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back.
Since Saturday at 6:00 p.m., over 21,000 people in Much and Rupichteroth have again had electricity.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually activated from 21.30 a.m.
Since 23.15 the last electricity has been affected by the failure.
Over 80 Monteurs from Westnetz and partner companies were in use.
After the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday morning, the authorities also called for neighbourhood assistance.
"It is important now that citizens and citizens take care of older or self-employed people in their neighborhood and communicate with local firearms when help is needed," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The construction and operation of emergency power units were mainly focused on the inhabitants of old houses.
In addition, temporary care facilities have been established in schools according to the authorities for those people who were unable to provide themselves or who require the power-dependent medical devices or refer to medical care.
Good morning!
Unfortunately, the roof is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy those with you and pay in euro?
It's the day cover #PRS_ORG# in blue.
I hope you also have a nice day and stay healthy.
But I can't mount this under the floor on the table.
It's Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 performances.
We wanted those with tableboard diameters of #NUMBER#
We got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# came in, but I can't move it in and so shorten it.
Can you help me over there?
Otherwise, I had to send them back, because they're not suitable for the purpose.
I'd be happy to report back.
Yeah, that's really easier!
Then we'll do it!
Can you send me the return card by mail?
the repair is now complete.
I've already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I did not restart the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Shall I do this now?
I find such a low letter almost unforgivable.
That's why we don't agree.
Nordic combination: Combined Ribs Wins

When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have both re-made s and used the version 4.5...
It may be that they have heard more often of problems
Having my #PRS_ORG# directly, a book bought it also seems to be in it.
As soon as I want to open the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.

I have to work through it too!
In order to ensure uniformity and purity, you should clean the components with some soap water of dust, fat and fingerprints, wash and dry with clear water.
Before you bring the brush the first time with a new color on the model, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later no longer visible inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first stroke on the piece
Draw the brush evenly stroke next to stroke.
Light coating of the colors later ensures an even area.
Avoid the brush quickly and with the brush.
This creates unrealisticly effective areas.
A model is not a gardening plant.
Start with the bright colors.
The darkness could appear later.
Metal tones and metallic colours come to the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can come to unpleasant metal stains when mixed with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you touch it.
Originally trusted appearances reach the models through the Decals or subtractors.
From high-ranking signs on aircraft between names of ships to gears and markings in car models: The Decals give the model the last slip.
Bring the Decals in the right order, as long as the components are still good to reach.
A flight cockpit can be glued or slightly glued before it is inserted into the ramp.
Even more important than the right tool, such as shears, brushets and toothbrushes, are during the glued time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut out each required Decal individually and lay it straight to you.
Decals are also referred to as water slide images, because you will soon touch their back with water until the wearer paper gets dark by the nose.
Then you scroll the picture just a small piece of paper and put the piece on the appropriate place on the model (which you have previously mentioned).
While you hold the Decal on the model with a tool, you remove the carrier paper side by side.
Attention: Always check if the image is right before you completely slide it from the paper so that it does not stick on your finger, knelt or even scratch.
Swallow excess water with a budget.
Not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only open a book short as soon as I look for something else then I don't read the book anymore and I have to sign up and sign up and reload the book and look for the place I have read to.
I've already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this by e-mail?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 individual packages
Even so, thank you very much!
Then I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
Do I get that back without any problems?
Childcare in PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
We had some time in child care, now when it comes to accounting with the PCV, it suddenly gets out of hand.
Line next:
We had applied for the children's wish tour in advance at the PCV and got the commitment over 3 attempts.
The tests were limited in no way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and childbirth and was calculated with the PCV.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and we had 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but they did not count out with the PCV.
We applied again for the cost of the PCV and again received 3 further attempts.
After some further trials (we have performed more trials than promised, logically counting the most expensive with the PCV) we will settle the calculations at the PCV and get the bad surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3) the PCV will only replace 3 trials.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth, the other 2 attempts of the first commitment are lost.
The second child wish was a new insurance case.
According to the AGB, however, "The insurance case begins with health treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who has the right here to replace the PCVs (only 3 attempts are made) or we (are 5 attempts to replace them)?
* Would the PKV have to point out in the commitments that with a birth the further attempts are coming?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (subjected to closed ladders) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give your opinion.
Thank you so much for your help!
Please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best reach them again
All right.
We won't order any more with them.
If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost a good customer.
They'd like to pass this on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the refund was made and now tell me that I only have to send the thing back.
I don't think I can do anything about the comodoration being completely disrupted by me.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
There is clear and clear that the repayment has been made and I still have not received any repayment by #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that they've lost two family customers now.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment over his account.
We're not gonna do that anymore.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
An office chair must be used normally.
Otherwise they may not sell it as a desk.
Regardless of this, the guarantee shall be valid for 24 months.
No, I can't get another type of packaging.
I will be able to remove the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Good afternoon, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products will be purchased with additional hookers to be purchased, but unfortunately we can't find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best Low Budget Films
What is exactly a low-budget film, there is no general definition with precise budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget movie** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no found from a major film studio or private investor.
In the network you can find a lot of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know the interesting representatives of this category?
What's wrong with you?
And maybe you don't like it at all?
I am a very good customer of you, I have already set up 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to ask the best price for the grey leathersofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it also reliable now?
Thank you very much.
With friendly greetings
If there's no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min, it's not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes on the waiting position...I'll give it up again soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Halber victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
In conflict with the Belarusian regime, the EU can announce a "half victory", according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
But the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees in Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
Sustainablely, the EU did not solve the confrontation, the researchers of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP) explained.
This condition - Belarus does not contribute very little, but the EU feels as a winner - may continue for a while.
The treatment of people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
Obviously, there is an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not committed to this, this is at the cost of fundamental rights.
This development also weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It obviously cannot be implemented if a Member State is in charge of doing its thing," as it is currently in Poland, which does not even allow EU Border Protection Agency Frontex to access the border.
In addition, the EU has paid another price for its policy at the border with Belarus, as Bossong: A principle agreement on asylum policy will be difficult, as the line "frontier protection, border protection and border protection" has been strengthened.
Reiterating attempt to cross-border
According to Poland's border guard, migrants have again tried to reach the Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and brought back to the border, a spokesman of the Authority said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were thrown with stones by the migrants at the incident outside the town of Czeremsza.
According to the data, a soldier was struck in the face and had to be provided by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU, Alexander Lukaschenko, as the owner of power in Minsk, proposes to have angeled it with a view to entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reported in press reports according to border sections.
The EU punished Belarus and threatened to bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners traveled to people's countries of origin to stop their departures.
The most effective element of the EU's response was the pressure on the refugees, Bossong said.
"This is where the EU has put its market power into the scales and has demonstrated its determination to operate with hard bands and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account domestic costs.
The Belarusian society is not likely to assume that the security apparatus regularly shuts thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial formula 1-finals
Max Versappen is expected to have two rules broken during the race, in the view of Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial formula 1 finale of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes filed an objection.
The silver arrows assume the same two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a alleged violation of Max's mistakes in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase when he should have been overcrowded on a regular basis.
A second objection was filed against the rating at the end of the race.
In Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed regularly.
In the last round of Lewis Hamilton in Mercedes, he was still caught up with his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety-car phase in which the Netherlands had taken over a car running before it.
I'll check it out.
I'm talking to the bank and register with you again.
Thank you for the support

I had a huge problem with you at the time when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# code.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the series "LiteraTour Nord" read by author Judith Hermann on Friday in her current novel "Daheim" and also acted as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the night noise at her door.
I gave up the contact form yesterday to return an article, but did not receive e-mail confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my request was submitted.
Not everyone has the time for your crowded chat and wrongly delivered cheapware from China.
Your mistake, which you correct and not everyone from our budget.
Contact woman #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or a woman #NAME# receive an email with a 60-euro voucher, a reordered order of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand and a back-end label.
This e-mail hasn't come yet.
The package wants to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.

Each channel can be dissolved with up to 16 bit / 31250 kHz and finally provides hiFi quality on your system.
There is virtually no difference to the original.
A class-D audio-end level with up to 3W output power controls the speakers who may have an impedance between 4 Ohm and 32 Ohm.
The huge 128 Mbit sound storage ensures sufficient capacity.
All individual sounds can be adjusted individually in volume.
The super-flexible sound engine without a rigid running plan allows the exemplary simulation of all thoughtable rail vehicles.
Three separately adjustable brake functions and two alternative load scenarios give you the maximum control over your vehicles.
But I'm sorry just because he says he's not an anti-Semitic, that's nothing.
It's like a drug dealer says he has nothing against foreigners.
Your i won't give it to both of you.
But colleagues are constantly reproducing any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just let it complete.
Yeah, then you're just as serious as a colleague.
Those who seriously question Evolution in principle are simply completely solved.
For my sake, a God has put all this into effect.
But as soon as you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is only convulsive.
And that makes you an enemy of science and no more serious as a colleague.
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the lupe should be approached as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanetically acromatic lens system allows you to use the lupe to the edge zone with a practical display and colour-free use of the lupe.
Often loops with zoom data are marked.
However, these data only apply to precisely defined conditions which rarely meet the conditions of use.
In order to use your lupe optimally, please note the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the pack).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices – so also when inflators – light flexes occur.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflex coating.
In compliance with the optimal conditions of use - Lupe close to the eye - mirrors on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
For further information, see the accompanying leaflet (available in German and English).

Dental sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz women search out the Christmas trees
Farmwirt Frank Diets has already experienced some of the situations when selling teeth.
One time a man should even be driving home without his partner because they could not agree.
Every year he plants a good 2000 pieces for it.
The 56-year-old has already experienced such a situation.
That makes Christmas time always a little fun, he says.
What about the voucher?
Or am I gone as a customer?!
However, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I'll evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need discussions here about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled at a rotating spear.
So they both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which in far away does not sound as nice.
Problems with glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new glass fibre connection in the house a few weeks ago.
Unfortunately, I have problems building a stable Wi-Fi network now.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received up to a few randoms without any delay 50 Mbit and sent it out.
The new glass fiber connector sends 500 mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also comes in.
However, on the other DLan module, which sends the Wifi, no longer the full 500, but the more I remove myself in the house with the module, the less comes (so use a plug dose that is 1, 2, 3, etc. spaces away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the internet with the new glass fibre connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently used a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were also similar large losses.
Could anyone explain to me why with glass fibers so much Internet speed on the power line is "lost"?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely important to lay down the LAN cable house.
I'm really disappointed why I've created an extra account here.
That's why I'd be so happy about an answer.
When it's time to change the giro account
Whoever thought, now would be quiet for the first time in the giro accounts, he's lying.
While many banks have used the autumn to confirm the tax increases in the past with all kinds of tricks from their customers, the free amounts for negative interest continue to decline.
For example, the Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she's just half the amount she's paid for the day's money and even quartered it for the day's money.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Group's Postbank - to EUR 50,000 in giro and investment accounts and to EUR 25,000 in day-to-day accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower amounts are applicable to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a speaker on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
The commercial bank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still applicable, as was the case with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, who was just popular with the most cost-effective customers, has reduced the free money to two levels, first at 50,000 euros, and now at 25,000 euros.
At the same time, more than 100 banks now have an amount of EUR 25,000 or less on the Verivox Internet Portal.
The Sparda Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: however, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres that have been given a right to this regulation in the first instance before the Berlin Land Court.
Now, the banks are already discussing whether the institutions should be able to make reservations - in the case that the higher institutions also have to declare negative interest rates, in principle, and have to be repaid to many millions of banks.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She's now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But your life is like a mountain and valley ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For those who made the 2021 with the "friends" reunite and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers is taking care of their appearance.
Anyway, so Aniston, she likes a chip on the day (yes, read correctly: a ONE chip from the Tute).
The fact that you fly the hearts of the female and male fans in the same way is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just got Pech with the luck - and she's still looking for the great love.
And the baby desire has been removed from the list.
Before she was constantly asked when she would be a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that question have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really insulting.
Hope to make success and fame happy as well.
Invalid end of career: queens must give up
Kimi's divorce from Formula 1 was even more subtle than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finne pulled out the gloves and removed the sweat from the chair.
That's it.
After a driving mistake and a slight tape touch, Räikkonen had to stop his Alfa Romeo at the great price of Abu Dhabi after not even half the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the royal class of motor sports.
His wife, Minttu, and the two children, were also traveling to the United Arab Emirates.
The biggest success of the Räikkonen was the win of the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He made 21 Grand Prix wins, started 18 times from the pole and arrived 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich holds 60th World Cup - Nolte wins in the twins - Sport
The mark of the Norwegian Biathlet Ole Einar Björdalen with 94 success is the goal of the Bobpilot.
"I have calculated this once, I had to win nine-and-a-half each season, then I could create it until Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic winner from the BSC Oberbärenburg, who had two success in the Winterberg race in two days.
He first refused the attack on Saturday by Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he drove from Rank three to one.
Then he changed something at the material setting and went out on Sunday with 0,30 seconds a larger lead.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Hall), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Hall) he stood in front of the British Brad Hall.
The third became the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We have gone to greater risk today and have been rewarded," said Friedrich, who also entered his 22nd victory in series.
The Berchtsgaden Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came to the square two times in rank five this time.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Fännbach landed four in the first race in place after Rank four.
"If I knew what he was doing, I would do it," said Lochner.
Zero with home victory - podium for Jamanka
With the women, Laura Nolte won the third season in the twins.
After it ran only for the fourth place on the previous day in Monobob, on Sunday, the German three-time success of Deborah Levi won the World Cup.
Double-bob Olympic winner Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringia came with Germany's fastest sprinterin, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen, to rank two.
In addition to her Olympia qualification, she booked the first post in this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed with Leonie Fiebig in place three.
For me, it was supercool, first post office in the World Cup, I'm superhappy that Mariama takes me.
I'm super pleased with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the beginning, but today's starting times were okay," Burghardt said and stressed: "It's not just a push, but there's a lot to do through it too."
Jamanka was a little upset about the not completely wrong rides, but he said, "It goes in the right direction".
I already had the cover in the shopping cart and could now buy it!!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I just didn't get it, and therefore I can't get it out of here, so I finally asked.
Because of Corona, I had a lot of other problems last year and never had time for it.
And now he's been calling it what's really bothering me.
Look at the chat it went around the Asare Sitzbank.
I would like to return it and then order it again, as it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipment only started on 16.3.
There was nothing from such a long delivery time on your website
No, just when I'm typing, there's an extra field with the message
I was taken off yesterday by your colleague.
Why is that a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrong being delivered.
But we want the regal module, however, just a new one undamaged.
And don't cancel the whole order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello, great girls and girls and women,
I've got some things I just want to write, and maybe it's the one or the other that...
I'm 24, I've got kPTBS, full-time student and Hundema - apart from my dog not screaming or going to the kindergarten, he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) has been ill, a 2nd degree burn took place on Monday and has been depressed for years (but now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs, and because I want to see him and feel, we had a lot of cake and it was nice.
I helped him with the shower (because hand is in relation to wg combustion).
He is cooled down and we now see less (1-2x week) what makes me very sensitive to my needs and love.
My dog boy has just had a stomach, I've cooked for him, and now he's in his cupboard, and he's relaxed a little after I've been there with the heat lamp and fighting for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and that's just for a month.
Now there is still housework on us, which we of course share.
But cooking yourself is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is just very well adjusted, I'm half-treated and I'm right.
Not good, but I'm right, and I'm almost out of symptoms.
My uni just requires a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3:00 a.m. I've made a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and overnight anatomy hours for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week I have a oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no room.
So my week goes like this: until tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But then the whole thing goes on?
Only until the day of birth.
Only until the start of the holiday.
Just until the weekend.
Just until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so upset that I need these spiritual points because otherwise I'm packing it down.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but otherwise I don't...
Is that how you feel?
Honestly, I'm incredibly grateful that I don't have to work.
I really appreciate that. I can't say that.
I don't know if I'd ever survived my kptbs.
I believe this has something to do with the mental load of women, and that's why I thought I'd find a secure relationship here...
I wish you at least one more relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I've got my order today. Unfortunately, the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table bone has printing.
On the first delivery, the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now I get another color or how?
The email to cancel was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
The other two times.
But she wasn't confirmed.
I found in school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and that it is just another matter for them like math or earth science.
For me, this was always a bit strange, perhaps because I was raised Christian and I always believed in it.
How are you doing?
Perhaps you can also talk about work and study colleagues with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is sensible to separate.
Also give the curriculum, etc.
But it was also rare to have a physical teacher who did not believe in the theory of relativity.
What, then, does one want to teach religion if one does not believe it?
Is culture real or something?
Hope your question isn't too private.
Can't be changed or not?Please write it in English I also understand well
It's been a long time, then I'd look away from it.
That's good, thank you.
I expect a return notice by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Please help with video searching
Hello, dear people.
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (about 24).
I think it's been a movie for young people.
There are two time axes (or parallel worlds) in the film.
To one of the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not quite sure).
Because I can't describe it any more in the real world, there's a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (Uniformly similar to those soldiers from the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the kingdom of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm to live himself I mean.
The transition is also I think the soldier's graveyard.
In the end, I think both soldiers are fighting each other.
If that's what I'm saying, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little girl just slept on the belly from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child is much more of a child than you think.
Make sure everything's right around here, no cubs, often walk around and watch, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good Matratze.
Don't kiss.
Axso and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but they've always had a blanket.
Watch your child when he's asleep.
Does it turn your head to the side?
Can it get out of the belly?
Or is it with the face directly in the mattress?
You can make sure everything's okay.
We've all grown up, and when my husband came to the world, it was for a walk, and it seemed that you put the kids on the couch to sleep.
In addition, we are already "stamkunde" with you and have already bought a lot of products
But why are you offering me only 20EUR?
Hello, I already wrote with a colleague from you yesterday and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC ID#).
The right shoulder does not fit into the closet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not to be used at the moment.
To make it quite clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the policy of this transmitter is now under all the sauces.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a large bed tour at the same time.
It was said to be an "independent" Internet transmitter.
Citat Arno: You want to be "no running bed column".
What is it now?
A 0815 advertiser who is trying to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
They are, of course, applicable to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to harm people.
A krogman who lacks empathy completely and at the cost of the action with the exploded rooms tries to make ash.
How can you find it all right?
Great if you like it, I think it's scary.
I'm asking for backup, since my delivered wooden table has been made defective.
Broken body by damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.

Kirschkern kits are a traditional home for well-being heat applications, as Kirschkerne heat can be very well absorbed and re-dosed.
The removable inner cushions can be warmed easily in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft reference makes the application particularly pleasant to make the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well.
The Kirschkern box with reference is suitable only for the following application areas:
Before heating the pillow on unusual smell, check the floor or fire spot and immediately dispose of it in the presence.
Please remove the inside cushion to warm up earlier!
Warm up in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (note the micro wave manufacturer's information!)
Just after heating, distribute the heat by shaking evenly in the pillow!
Then put the inside cushion back in the case.
In the first heatings, a mild moisture formation can occur on the surface, but disappears in repeated applications.
Keep in mind the heating instructions given, as longer times or higher energy performance can cause damage (dangerous and combustion risk!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that a heat of cereal products in the manufacturer's instructions is allowed.
After the heated inner cushions have been returned to the reference, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitable for babies (max. 43 °C) on your wrist!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile diseases, circular complaints, fresh haematomas, blood clots and open wounds, or in people with reduced pain.
For existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumour diseases, and pregnancy, please refer to a doctor before use.
If the nests have been opened and free kernels emerge, dispose of the product and the free kernels immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the child’s temperature should be monitored regularly during application to avoid overheating!
All serious events relating to the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country where the user is placed.
The reference is removable and washable in the machine at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Henserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the football league.
This is why Hannover 96 works from the table cellar.

Is the battery broken?
Yesterday evening my laptop (thinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded through my network part.
I bought this again about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the net part alone was enough for the operation.
The battery is empty and the laptop does not start anymore despite the inserted network part.
After that, I've grown the battery, but there's nothing here either.
Do you want any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in the network operation?
Was there something else that was broken?
Thank you so much for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But you don't know how high the seat is....
Often on a tour and yet a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack of Peak Design no problem!
20 litres of capacitors also swallow larger photo equipment without problems that can be safely understood using the polished FlexFold parts.
And what you still need in everyday life remains well organized and separate from the photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line on version 2 (V2), the series is still presented in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has it literally in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that are reliable to protect the interior of the backpack and yet provide quick access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two options: Once conventionally via the lid that can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proved itself at the Messenger Bags.
There is a metal cap with suitable anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has thought of various "fills": there are 4 anchor bars, which are permanently destroyed in which the closing hooks can be attached.
If the backpack is full, if you just take the top bar, it's rather empty, a deeper one.
The hooks and hooks are also magnetic.
This way the backpack can also be reliably closed without the hooking.
The second option also distinguishes the everyday backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the greatest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to feel through the contents anymore!
At the same time, this cleverer detail increases the daily fitness of the backpack: if you include not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In every day's Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more than below) and then easily steal each other - and access it independently through the two side openings.
In addition, you can pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body to access, for example, the camera equipment in the right main case, while the everyday things remain safe in the left half of the backpack and do not come between.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable wear belts help.
And since the outer box of the backpack is also full of 100 % recycled, weatherproof nylon, the content remains dry even if it is to go to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I look forward to the e-mail of her support.
#NAME# yesterday has me an e-mail confirming the appointment of the
Contact was announced after the shipment to collect the wrong table delivered.
So far, I haven't received a message.
I'm asking for immediate settlement.
I am already writing with the third support staff, with no one else than the promise that I will receive an email as confirmation.
It is the return of the wrong delivered custom #NAME#
Is it to be seen when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
It's working.
Thank you so much for helping.
Would you like another nice evening?
Hello, my order is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
The order and payment were on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the license to me, I'll give up a bigger order immediately, but anyway, I kept the damaged piece of furniture and didn't send it back.
And that last year was different from the thought I couldn't recognize and I just couldn't fix it on time and clarify it.
But I don't accept the damage as a customer.
Rotating brake discs are designed to assess the dynamic driver’s requirements, the reliability and safety of brakes also under difficult conditions.
Rotating brake discs are manufactured from Guss and then mechanically processed (dried and cut).
All selected discs are manufactured in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are peculiar to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created which is aimed at changing the disc according to the characteristics of the original mounting.
In this way, designed discs ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additionally created openings increase the efficiency of the cooling of the disc, with the cuttings improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake locks.
The aesthetic properties of our dedicated discs underline the character of each car by its attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event marked the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing cracks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and released the so-called "California Gold Rush" of ‘49.
Thousands came from Nah and far and made Coloma one of the fast-growing and flourishing cities of the country.
Areas were hidden, tents were erected, and saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the country.
For many it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptt)!
In this game you are a pioneer who is looking for in the West wealth and wants to make a name.
You'll be looking for gold, recruiting workers, riding horses and building companies.
You will also be given the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to overcome your pioneer colleagues so you don't have to take the rest of their time.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
At the same time, you choose your actions, you need to keep your resources at home and create a table that "works more and more for you" (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tablet allow you to become more efficient, to receive additional actions or to apply rules to your favor.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual game style with fine adaptations.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year in which the California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year in which California reached the official state).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will select a location on the game plan secretly and simultaneously, where they can perform actions.
Then their selection is discovered and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a place has most pioneers, it'll get a barrier!
This disables half of the location - thus reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players perform different actions such as winning resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching for rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning revolvers.
If all the actions are completed, the pioneers will return.
At the beginning of each round, the contractor turns to a new location and thus changes the available actions.
This goes on for as long as the attacker moves five times, so every place has been hidden once and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which the Coloma players have to defend against an attack of angry bandits.
If the players have committed enough revolts and the bandits are numerically superior, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive less rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final evaluation takes place.
The player wins with most winning points!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation has been published today in my Twitter-Timeline, and I have just watched it.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a pleasant guest in Talkshows and is giving talks across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrans" (2008), he triggered a strong educational debate.
Ex-patients and educators are now raising serious objections against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other guardians must never, never, never! go to power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child a room for his development and to make the child's frame as big as it is reasonable and possible in the situation.
Brother, I'm still undercover.
Holettschek: Countries advise on the removal of the test obligation for three-fold vaccinated
At its next meeting, the Ministers of Health would like to decide on a three-fold test case.
"We countries need rapid clarity, whether or not and from when the test obligation can occur for three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), president of the Health Minister's Conference, the "Image on Sunday".
The drop of 2G plus for three-fold vaccines is "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional impanesy," Holetschek said.
Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) said that "he will be making a proposal to do so on Tuesday." - afp

How am I supposed to get the best out of it?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can't go shopping about my #PRS_ORG# anymore.
Display: Ups, there was an error.
Buy via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I updated the account details.
What can this be?
What you describe is described as *awareness*, that is, sensory perceptions under full-narcotics.
These occur at a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
The most common is the hearing of sounds/voices, the rarest to see pictures and the rarest to experience pain.
For this topic, it is relevant: Imperial cut-offs are operations that deal with an increased rate of Awareness, as one avoids a very deep drug to protect the child until it is swallowed.
Previously episodes of Awareness should be mentioned in the Narcotics Discussion.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love everyone, this comment from me describes the awareness correctly, but had not** u/Nitemarex **by definition.
I've read her comment wrong.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the €20 does not help us either.
These are legal guarantees.
The absolute minimum would be that they would take back the defective chair.
This is in addition to the legal obligation also standard in the area of eCommerce.
Please check again if they are at least withdrawing the defective chair.
We sell the second chair in private.
That's where we lose some money.
I already sent you an e-mail that you haven't answered.
Again the question.
The order and the invoice says that the goods are delivered to a room of my choice.
The sender is a company #NAME#.
I'm just calling there.
I was told that they only delivered before the door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that right?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I do not know the person who can carry the heavy furniture in the first floor.
I'm not gonna call you, am I?
I had asked a question
Theater historian Günther Rühle died 97 years old
He has been profiled as a theater critic and as an intendant.
Later he wrote a monumental drama story.
On Friday Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, fresh in print: "An old man is getting older."
The frightening diary of a slow separation from the world, led by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading, the message comes that the author died.
The last sentence in the book is, "I am witnessing here my life's purpose."
There are different types of palettes.
One of the most common are European lettuces, named wooden pallets, which are used primarily in the European space as cargo carriers.
They are certified by the European Palette Association EPAL
According to data from statistics Austria in Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced.
The value of production was well worth EUR 79 million.
How many palettes are imported to Austria annually, will not be raised
New York won the MLS Championship for the first time
New York City FC won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After the 1:1 in the regular playing time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in the Elfmeter shooting with 4:2.
At the end of the Eastern Conference, New York was going through against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I had received a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect gulag.
It was Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again for this :)
Now I've come to the taste and I want to cook the first rouladen to Silverster.
I'll set up a cattle fund for this tomorrow.
Do you have any other tips for me anyway?
Note: I don't have a oven, but just a big pot.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't so good anymore, but I get it
ICE is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by mail on 18.01 that the refund was made.
But to this day, the money hasn't come in with me.
Please check there.
Where in the room Lübeck there are still Christmas brats
For many people, Gans or Ente belong to Christmas days such as the dentistry and gifts.
You haven't taken care of a bird yet?
Now's the time.
We'll tell you where you got another Christmas tree in the room Lübeck.
The "drive" of a piper level contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor switch.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can set the desired level on the one hand and the level of your sound on the other.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique power level rule that can reduce the signal level without changing anything at "gain" and distortion.
Further on, it was already announced that with the POWER LEVEL ruler, you can even sail a performance reserve if it goes smoothly.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL regulation, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is edited with a box simulation so that you get an impressive "acoustic" sound impression yourself when using a headphone or direct shots.
The AUX book can be connected to a CD or MP3 player so you can join your favorite songs.
A Tuner function is also on board - so you do not need a separate voice device.
If you spend an additional VFS5 foot key, it can also call the sounds comfortably by foot, turn the effect blocks on/off and the tempo of the corresponding effects "stop".
This is actually unacceptable for live use.
With its new power packages, VOX will take another step into the future!
But you'd see it like that with others.
Is it possible to send the lamp back?
Since it's too low for a table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with that?
What about the comet?
Do we receive an update in the next few weeks for the exact delivery deadline?
Hello, they've been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it wasn't for me, I'd be happy with a legacy or a gift.
Under the circumstances, I find a receiver for the furniture.
Just over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need then a little bit.
I just received my delivery and I would have liked to know if screws were provided as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the intended hooks.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been rewarded
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
In the negotiations on the resumption of the International Atomic Convention, progress has been made following Iranian data.
"Both sides are about to agree on the issues that should be on the agenda," said Iran's Chief Trader Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the Irina News Agency.
This was a "positive and important development", because at first it did not even agree on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the revitalization of the agreement were continued after almost a week's interruption.
Dealers from Iran, Germany, the UK, China, France and Russia participate in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also on-the-spot in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia Overhauled Saxony - Frestate now Germany with highest Corona incidence
Thüringen has dissolved Saxony and currently shows the highest incidence in the United States.
As the only federal country, the value is above the mark of 1000.
At the Corona incident on Sunday, Thuringia was the only federal country to have a brand of 1000.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which has always been the highest in the United States, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday the incident in Thuringia was slightly reduced, but it also had a value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new outbreaks with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 more deaths were reported in connection with an infection within one day.
200 severe to Covid-19 patients were treated intensively on Sunday in hospitals.
At weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health offices have been overloaded for weeks and are barely behind with the recording of new cases.
I get it.
As delivery takes place at the beginning of March, it may be possible to do so.
I have to print it and stick it to the package and put it in the mail, was it?
I don't have to click/add/fill anything here?
That's exactly why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take over the shipment at my own expense.
8 euro Return fee is a frequency in my eyes.
It is time for changes
##MBundeday is welcome to me, I am u/stratorDE in the plenary room in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
# Why's the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBunda festival you can find one thing: it is not existential.
We came to a winter star and extended the summer hole for a few months.
#What's the problem?
Yeah, where was it?
For the most part, this should simply relate to the dissatisfaction, how some things have happened here and how we are generally present.
In the last days, there has been a growing impression that many here have still bock on the MBundesday.
#What we need to change
At this place the community is asked around the MBundesday who wants to keep them alive.
The attack came from u/edizVEVO, who has been paying attention to this project in the last days and has found one, simply said, turtles.
After writing and writing, several people from the community found themselves wishing to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to call on everyone to participate, but only if this project can exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a record server on which we can exchange each other, as well as develop concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will the MBundeday work in the future?
* What existing arrangements must be changed / adapted / removed?
* How are we going to go abroad in the future?
* How are new members to be appointed?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but what's not bad, we've finally got the difference.
If you have a desire and time, come to the discord, work with and let us decide democratically about the future.
I've ordered a lamp screen to be delivered to you.
Now I see that the article is too big for it and not suitable for my taste.
I've already ordered another suspension for this.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also rather sad as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, there are also those in excess, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# needs to be able to guarantee me that the wrong cabinet is picked up in time.
And I'm asking you to do that now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but will unmount the cabinet as much as possible for the collection - they need to clear with #PRS_ORG# how it can work.
#PRS_ORG# can call me on the phone at any time to agree a pick-up time.
Is there a guide for the assembly?
How long would I have time to provide this or decide for the return?
How do you answer the question, why are you vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She has lived a while of vegetarians herself, at present she probably eats very rarely meat.
I was a vegetarian myself a few years ago.
On the question of whether I have always wanted to be a vegan, and Vegetarianism has been a planned step, I have answered honestly without much thought.
And although I thought for a long time that I as a vegetarian would support the animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I would ultimately also support animal qualeries.
That's why my decision is to be vegan.
At the moment I had the impression that it was on her part of missmut, she then defended Vegetarianism and she thought she knew where her flesh came from and was reduced as Vegetarian animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer to "pump" was?
How do you answer the question?
If you have the feeling that you are quickly stuck as a Veganer in a corner and there are conflicts, without which you would put it on.
It welcomes a harmonious Veganer (;
This is clearly not an exception to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# do not disconnect from the legal requirements for remote access.
I am on the assigned date, on which #PRS_ORG# does not pick up my returns on site.
As I cannot be on the spot because of an apology, this cannot be changed.
Please give me an alternative pick-up date.

Lahnsteiner Wehr for Water Rescue: 45,000 Euros Country Grant
Recently, the Rhineland-Pfälse Interior Minister Roger Leventz handed over an application certificate of EUR 45,000 in Lahnsteiner Radhaus for the new water-saving of the Voluntary Firefighting of Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle used since November 2020 amounted to EUR 135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the country of Rheinland-Pfalz supports us here," said Lahnstein Mayor Peter Labonte.
The vehicle is used by the diving staff Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water they perform tasks in water and ice rescue and technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, you can count on increasing rates: the boom of the hotel boat ride on Rhein and Mosel and the continued growing use of the lain as a leisure flow contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
However, following their recommendations, I have synchronized, removed, and the newly loaded app NECHT has worked.
I'm a little frustrated because the whole operation has cost me a lot of time and I hope now to help.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection to June.
Can I enter a date in the order procedure?

For the first time, thanks to the fact that you're standing here, I've spent almost a decade in the state service in a similar activity, we've also talked about weapons in the executive, I don't want to go on!
The question of the right and the left is always very simple.
In principle, however, it should be said that, of course, the civil servants come from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary links, which should be clear to everyone.
The fact that, of course, even in the particular uniform and weaponry of people, the right of conservative magic should also make it clear to everyone that these people can then of course deal hard with the living reality is of course also clear, because you have of course beside the average white, while at the same time many Germans with migration background, women and also homosexuals (and so I don't now mean the exaggerated female clichés, because they exist in the execution rather than just the very normal men and women whom it has not been noticed if they can't tell it) and also to these people, and I have to leave me, because in doubt they will save your life or put it in for you.
But even if it sounds funny for me for the first time, they are proud of Germany and they feel that they are rather less engaged in over-left policies, even if they are probably used for them or think they have to do right, they simply want to be treated in a normal way.
Back to the rights, since of course police and fighting forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme rights there that they may say openly there or even openly harm any state-threatening plans are completely overrun and anger me too.
Of course, even policemen and soldiers who were often in foreign service often started to pause out because of negative experiences, and sometimes things say the controversy to politics are wrong.
It is also true that even right-minded people will be able to exchange their thoughts.
Nevertheless, I believe that this is a good fight, and it is also counterproductive with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so international, and that's good, I think, because we couldn't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, what I don't understand, the other basket I also ordered on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I already ordered in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I used to chat with #NAME#.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in Black to Germany or this basket is available in Germany somewhere.
I always find you as a partner company.
But on the top of the wood, there were two deep beryls, which were filled with gold.
And on the mirror itself is a little scratcher
Ordinarily through a child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (by myself, very little leisure time), but for a long time I have been getting worse than being right to my household to keep clean and orderly.
There are always phases in which everything stays, and then and when it packs me and I wake up and drink.
But it is never so "that one could come to visit spontaneously."
My husband is not better, though I am upset somewhere, but most of the time, the household simply loses work and unemployment.
The kitchen will still be clean the most regularly as we like to cook.
Now on my question, have you made it more orderly with the child?
We still have nothing to do with it, and this question has been on me for a long time.
Because for me I don't have any tension, it just doesn't bother me so much until a visit comes and, for example, always fresh clothes is there and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger urge with the child or stay stupid?
I'm happy to hear your answers.
Exclusive, new, and qualitatively high-quality and anatomically preformed cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows for an almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Preforming with special, further strangulation on the links for improved freedom of movement (on arm and knees)
For Focea Comfort 4 the area covered by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled to further increase the comfort.
Narrow stretch panels on the joints reduce friction (axles, arm and knee bends)
High-quality formations in the lower back area and step by step ensure a tight, perfect seat.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch panel in the Linden Wire area increases the flexibility of the backrest closure and thus improves the comfort, especially when bending and mounting and installation of the equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone, located around the shoulders and back, guarantees increased flexibility in the movements of the arms and back.
Fireskin is a warm, waterproof material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings heat into a sensitive area of the body.
Nailless, thin (-2 mm) shuttering on the face at the hood increases comfort, shuttering and susceptibility (separate head hair)

Career in social work - than someone with a more self-secured personality disorder?
I've been training in software development and I've been studying for about a year now.
Unfortunately, however, I am increasingly aware that this profession is not the right thing for me to do, and I have been thinking about relaunching and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or fearful) personality disorder (AVPS).
That means that I don't have a feeling of self-esteem, and I'm scared accordingly.
I don't have a problem with talking to people at a real level, but I find it very difficult to have a casual conversation and I've been told more often that I'm working hard (though I think I'm already getting better).
Can I be a social worker like that?
I do not want to work as a streetworker or in the open youth meeting, but rather in search advice or family assistance.
But I don't know if the actual working day is really like I imagine it, and it's hard to find something on the Internet.
The EVPS is already leading to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it brings me down every time there's something on my code (the simplest things are already missing) and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help (the "I should really know how to do it"/"I keep him with my stupid questions from working"/"who really has to keep me down for a while" etc.).
The problems I'll probably have in every profession but I wanted to mention them in the place.
But you've got the sofa back yet?
Because there was no confirmation.
I'm waiting for a pick-up date.
What do you think they're giving back?
If I have downloaded a book on #PRS_ORG#, your #PRS_ORG# report does not authorize this book
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG# who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein (protein) taken with the feed breaks the bird into its stomach-damm tract into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) and builds from these its own proteins, which it also needs to be fed.
Fertiliser training in nestling and breeding in mice are extremely complex procedures and are associated with a particularly high level of exposure to the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON bio may not be administered during breeding, as it may otherwise occur during pregnancy.
Following this short supply of NECTON-bio, the daily supply of vitamins with NECTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NECTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

Please excuse them, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can a desk be broken after 9 months ?
The guarantees in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to tell you that my order was damaged and images were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement by a Community employee in opposition to the Statute
Hallo r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be found on our property.
So a case application was submitted to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the cases of fruit trees and thus the Walnuss is not part of the constitution.
In the constitution, however, the walnuss is explicitly indicated as a protective tree.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the constitution is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I didn't get a message.
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Would you like to offer me a copy or a gift?
What was more expensive than that?
Yes, I think the only question is whether I can pay in euro and let me deliver the cover to Germany
Can you check that out?
E-mail: severe traffic accident with self
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred at St 2179 between the connection station Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the police's press alarm reports today (14:03 AM) a Pkw has arrived in the front traffic.
There are injured.
I get it.
Well, thank you so much again, it was so simple!
Council and ideas for further professional life
Happy Christmas to you for the first time!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good, because my dear head just covers everything you can think about.
Before I go out here now .. in short: I need advice and the best of people who know my situation - so from you.
I'm just making the reef as a quere raiser.
Originally, I studied something else and worked there in an area (to keep at least a little anonymous, I call here nothing more precise).
The whole thing was too boring for me, and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
At one time I landed at the teaching center and I was sure that it was - even though the framework conditions were much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but that was not the case with me.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job bids".
And it's only half a year around.
At times I have always decided to continue and at least to end the ref, after which I can still move on.
But I'm absolutely finished.
I've had so little time in the last month that I've been totally out of my mind.
Now there are holidays, but there's still a herd of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref I always thought I would be stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my holiday night.
I was free.
And the stress at work was at the same time equal.
Now I'm having a family holiday too much stress myself.
And then there's these sharp structures that make me more nervous.
Basically it makes fun and looks from the outside also runs well with regard to feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and I wonder how much stress my body can take before it completely closes - if it doesn't already.
I wonder if I would like to have the rest of my life in this way - just when I read some contributions from you here - or if I should not go back to the old area, because I was valued, could take free time when I needed it, and though the work was somehow boring, but for this it was properly paid and worked together in a team and not as a single fighter as it is now the most time of the case.
But then I wonder if in one year I have not returned to the same place as now and am unhappy.
You see, it's all wrong, but maybe you've got it as an external council or ideas, like I'm out of this situation, which I'm completely done with and starting to cry almost at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, which probably leads to nothing good.
But perhaps your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for the first time.
Thank you for reading and apologizing to the wine cellar of me.
I hope my situation has become at least a bit clear.
Since its launch in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has continued to develop, among other things, the combination of advanced modelling technology with the "Valve Reactor" mode, which perfectly imitates the behaviour of a pipe amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we present a brand-new modeling engine that is absolutely at the latest state of the technique in matters of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers await with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also, of course, contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube amplifier.
This is partly based on real analogue switches, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube enhancer better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated switch, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed case and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only spread.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and link historical facts on the virtual level until the Amp and effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of pipe sound with modeling technology is mainly due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since now in order to meet newly added sound requirements, which once again led to a VOX Valvetronix series performance booster models with more dynamics as well as more numerous and crucially improved amplifiers.
From handy VT20+ to VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed to find all guitarists looking for a maximum sound diversity here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube enhancer: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced play of play dynamics and string stroke and a prompt speech.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the end-stage determines the pipe character of an amplifier and developed VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor switching of each VT+ amplifier, with a 12AX7 tube, represents the behavior, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier perfectly.
NBA: Despite 20 points of Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The Dutch series of Orlando Magic is held in the NBA.
The Wagner brothers can shine - however, it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven figures of his older brother Moritz lost magic on Saturday 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers.
The main feature is also adaptable: with three individual placid and foldable shutters, it is directed to your photo equipment according to the need and is therefore suitable for any type of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes up to full format mirror reflex cameras.
What finally fits into the backpack, of course depends on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible occupation would be a DSLR camera with a set target, two to three interchangeable objects and a flashlight.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 allow room for further objectives.
You can also steal any more accessories.
And anyone who has a small DSLM camera (MFT camera from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for its equipment and for photo-foreign things.
Drone pilots also meet with the Everyday Backpack 20L an optimal choice, because the backpack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption on La Palma: probably the longest of history
In the almost three months since the outbreak, the lava flows on the Canary Islands have caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was 84 days long on the Atlantic island in front of West African coast.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in the past days, but Vulcanologists have not been waiting for a forecast when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, state TV channel RTVE.
Damages in millions
In the almost three months since the outbreak, the more than 1,000 degrees of hot lava has destroyed nearly 2900 homes and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a metedic lava layer.
This corresponds to nearly 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 people had to be evacuated, the damage was estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new landings with a total size of about 50 hectares were created in front of the coast by the cold lava.
The main concern was the very important banana cultivation for the island, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 people live directly or indirectly and which was already before the volcanic eruption in the crisis.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas were severely damaged, the newspaper "El País" wrote.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas stands at the door, and especially the children will not be able to expect the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have been associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the scrupulous excitement of some seductiveness.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
More importantly, it is important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of the gift so that the gesture of the gift, which, according to French sociologists and ethnologists, Marcel Mauss, has been a peace-sponsoring "the social treaty of natural peoples", can be avoided and filled with life in the context of this tradition.
How the Christ Child Was Made of Nikolaus
It was strictly taken by the Protestants, by whom the Christmas days were closely associated with the gift.
Previously on the Nikolaustag gifts were handed over to some kind.
The background of this popular seat today is that Saint Nikolaus as Bishop of Myra threw three women secretly gold into her window in one night to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional form of gift, the popular use in Germany was to fill the boots with gifts, especially the children.
Protestants resorted to this use because they denied mediators between God and men as "holy worship".
For these reasons, they defend themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christ Child out of the Nikolaus and thus founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift thus shifted to the sacred night.
Since most Protestants do not see such details so closely, it only upsets the least that the use of Saint Nikolaus is still a solid part of the Christmas season, like Martinsingen and Martinsumzug.
Today, you can find in boots before the door and under the Christmas tree of socks up to the desired luxury watches of all that the heart desires.
Variety of traditions in Christian countries
Sources show a tradition of the gift since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nikolaus.
With the reform, the day of the gift moved to the Holy Night.
In all Christian countries, however, a happy Kuddel model raises the question of who now brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region in question whether the Christ child appears at the Holy Night or the Christmas man, who is basically a species of Nikolaus, who was assigned some peculiarities with time.
This includes, for example, his white noise bar, which only has little to do with the rather strict assyrian bar of the historical figure, his slabs that are drawn by renting and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, the Holy Nikolaus remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy there is the Hexe Befana, who should have shown them the way to Jesus.
In Scandinavia, the gifts are sometimes brought by fabulous beings, while in Russia it brought Fathers Frost to some glory.
Here are not rennies, but three horses that pull as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the mother country of the reform in the course of the Hussites war, the child is responsible for the delivery of gifts.

Police shoots verbal bank robbers near the Royal Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police reported that the callers had reported a man who was supposed to have gone to a bank with a gun and the business of a bookkeeper.
The man fled to the authorities in a vehicle which could not be stopped by officers later.
It was shot down and the man was hit.
He was still declared dead in the tavern.
The police didn't go from a terrorist background.
Several messages are located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
What then?

In the Hollywood spectacle, there are usually dangerous objects from distant galaxies that glow in colour.
On the other hand, “Smart Stone” is quite harmless: Only the sun ensures that this sunlight shines fascinatingly – either in white or colourful light (in six different shades of colour).
The sideless, amorphous design is consciously chosen: As a natural-formed large jaw, this modern light object presents itself at day.
Its organic surroundings fit in every natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone area.
He also does good in the vicinity of larger keel and findlings, where he knows to say thanks to his size.
Large preparations can be saved: As a solar lamp “Smart Stone” does not require any transmission or batteries.
Place the “lightstone” at any place that is sun-split days.
Two co-delivered earthworms provide a firm hold if necessary.
The matt white plastic housing itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module hides “Smart Stone” discreetly inside it, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colourful light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
In the case of inflammable doom, “Smart Stone” begins to shine on itself; in which color, you determine yourself: six attractive colors of light are available to you – next to day’s white – to choose.

Pills problem
Hello, dear Weibswolk,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year is actually delivered my first post.
About my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during the period and had dirty PMS before the period.
Now I'd like to let it go again, because I have to take enough drugs that I can't choose from because of chronic diseases.
My main problem, of course not the pain, but my skin.
At my last about two-year break from 0 to 100 explosive pickles and these all over the place.
It's so superficial, but it's been a great burden to me, and I don't feel like it.
In the two-year break, the whole has never really normalized itself.
Maybe he's got some tips to avoid this time.
Without perfume and without mercy, my cosmetics already exist, but maybe there's something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the doctor didn't take me so seriously and the skin doctor is still coming.
Thank you very much for everyone who has read through the novel!
Yes, the love skin is so cool.
Had prebupertary bad neurodermitis, then a time of peace, then large-scale bone marrow and the acne theme.
I have also tried everything possible in the course of chr. disease and I am left hanging on low sugar, milk and meat-poor mixed food because otherwise nothing has worked so well.
It may also be good that Hormonal is just the worm inside, but if you like me everywhere you want to keep you from going any further looking what's going wrong.
I already had all of her colleagues' seminars.

110-kV-Earth cable is new built in 2022
The approval for the release of the new high-voltage ship at Tann is valid.
The plan-making decision of the government of Lowerbayern opens the way for the construction to begin in 2022.
This was now shared by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometres long cable will connect the Tann circuit in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilvolt line between Simbach and Pfarkirchen.
The cable is connected to a mast of release near the village of Edermanning at Reut.

Ref: Plan training (EC)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been in the ref since summer, teaching makes me fun, but I still have major problems in time to plan my teaching in the field of earth science.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the table, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In school I can also only copy s/w for free (which nerves to earth science).
I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently making the theme geofactors, and I actually have every hour for myself.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time for simple teaching hours (which I also need for UBs etc.).
I go from learning to planning (what I want to achieve) and think about how I can build it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that do not have my school).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather unhappy.
That's why the worksheets too.
Maybe I can work with the book on a time-efficient basis.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
In fact, I have already decided for a new at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to complete the retours for the first time as soon as possible.
Trade fears about Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
In most businesses, only those who are vaccinated or healed are allowed to do so.
Trade considers that there is no need for and benign revenue cuts.
He's got a possible solution, too.
From the perspective of the German Trade Association (HDE) the 2G rules destroy the important Christmas business.
In dealing with items of non-day needs, it was to complain about revenue cuts, HDE chief businessman Stefan Genth criticised.
According to a current survey of the HDE under 1100 traders, more than 70 percent of the companies looked negative on the rest of the year.
Many would have written off the Christmas business.
"What should be the positive height of the year is now often a hole without soil," Genth said.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions thus lost almost one third of their pre-crisis rates over the past week.
Good only runs in food retail and online.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept was a safe matter, said the chief businessman.
"2G does not bring us forward in the fight against the pandemic" he stressed.
The current regulations scared customers and required high staff use.
The banning system had to be approved throughout the country, he demanded.
After that, each customer had to be checked only once at 2G (vomited or healed) and had access to all business with the band received on that day.
In addition, sampling should be sufficient in retail trade - as already in public transport in the case of the 3G rule (vaccated, healed or tested) - sampling.
The Deutsche Euroshop, specialized in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last reported without 2G at well 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, the sales at approximately 90 percent.
These figures will now be safe in the middle of such important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Employment Week".
Due to the high personal and administrative burden, the Centre will be tried to find solutions and be approved.
This includes the so-called band solution, where "the visitors can, for example, enter a central place in the center once their 2G ID and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to in a club hotel - enter all the shops undamaged". dpa
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error that has been tried with a yellow filler.
That's not nice.
I'd like to give the mirror back and I already packed it back into the package and glued it.
How do I have to move on to the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high colour rendering.
For setting the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor provides exceptional possibilities.
In addition to the adjustment of the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitively manageable.
The light creates a very light stream with soft light of high quality, completely flammable.
The radiation angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively small distances is excellent.
Other than in reporting situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the film set or on the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is installed in difficult accessible places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of keys and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current colour temperature in Kelvin.
There is also the slot for the NP-F battery (not included in delivery)
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and colour temperature.
In order to perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage sites, it is simply by pressing one of the storage keys for longer periods of time and complete.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when switching off, so that when you start the new switch, the familiar situation is restored - very practical when the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the largest strengths of DL3120 functionality is derived from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F battery.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera men (and women) - so you can take back on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the battery has sufficient power - it's a battery-tighter as well as built-in - for each of the two battery modules a value in both displays (the left battery top display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, of course, it is possible to provide the light bulbs over the supplied network part continuously with electricity.
The construction of the light bulb is very easy.
You have a 16mm hole as an attachment so you can directly access your photostatic.
The inclination shall be reliably adjusted by fixing on both sides.
It was considered that the mechanical components are also extremely high and are therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a needle hook is included in the delivery range.
Great is that also contains a bag in the delivery range.
Thus you can buy the light with all the accessories you may still want to buy, without safe transporting or storing problems.
The damage I have received and it is too small :(
"Party that we wanted to puke": Frankfurt celebrates a dry comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Intracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in the series of sieglosen Hessen were probably on the way to the next Bundesliga Square.
But then the SGE turned up, and within a good hour the hunger broke out over a grown season start from the soul and beat Furios with 5:2. "It's crazy what the boys did today," cheered Coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and said a "Pauschal Lob, to every one who was with him" .
At first, it looked after a renewed damper for the Frankfurters now standing behind their expectations in rank nine.
Patrick Schick had led the Leverkusner with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"How the players have then returned and shown a fantastic performance," Glasser continues.
I'm crazy happy with the performance we've shown and of course also with the result.
Also dissident Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand back on the scene for the first time since the fourth game day and his surpassing muscle injury, stressed the morals of his teammates.
"I believe that our mentality is incredibly large," said the 27-year-old and looked forward to the outcome, especially for the audience.
That was the party we wanted to fuck today.
For the next tasks, however, Glasser wants to keep the focus on himself, but also looks well on the staff situation.
It is exceptional that we have all the players fit in December that all the players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professionally.
Now you want to "go step by step and stay modest" and to "go through the tasks at this level" until the year-to-year change.
The next one is on the program at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18:30, Sky) on Wednesday.
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent back to me, or do I have to wait until the money has been returned and the order is returned?
If I were to say that I will not order again because it has already lasted a very long time.
Have they ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Dumps for handball women in front of quarter-finals against Spain
Germany's handball women seem to be demeaning against Denmark with hanging heads and empty views of the park.
At the end of the World Cup, the DHB election at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 viewers in Granollers was a bitter defeat and must now run against the Spanish host in the quarter-final.
"We were too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," said Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
We must act against Spain differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points as the second behind the Danishs (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the river.
That was a bad game for all of us to delete," said Captain Emily Blok.
In the fight to enter the semifinal, a significant increase against the WM Second of 2019 is needed on the coming Tuesday to keep the delicate dream from the first medal since 2007.
The best German publisher in duel with the three-time Olympics Denmark was Alina Grijseels with six towers.
"We were simply not there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense," said Xenia Smits, Space Player, asking: "We need to look forward quickly now."
From front to back not above
Unlike in the previous five tournaments, the German team with the anpfiff was not at the height.
Errors and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4-back position after seven minutes.
Just Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented with some parades of badgers.
The first gate reached the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick opposite.
However, this was not the expected initial ignition.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danes, the German women could hardly stand in scene - and if so, they usually failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the door of the Scandinavia.
So the party ran early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially the rear-view player Mia Zschocke didn't see red yet because of a hard fool at her opponent.
But at the quarter-final, it can work again.
Only in the final phase of the first half time did the DHB selection get a little better into the game and up to a break on at least five doors.
The only silent hope for an upheaval after the change was after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Greeners committed sin in all areas and made it easy for the well-established opponent, who was among the medal candidates at the end of the day.
As a result, the German team could no longer reach an increase in performance and went as a clear loser from the park.

I'd like to pass a code of goodwill
as with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Is that with them?
The title presupposes that I am active as an important in mobile implants in which (until now only) the BioNTech/Pfizer implant is vaccinated in foster care.
As soon as these are finished to a large part, then it will continue to part in vaccination centres for me.
I would like to answer questions without a time limit on the organisational and human aspects and also medical questions, if they are not related to a personal (e.g. "I take medicine X, it involves the vaccination.").
In my task area, the explanation for the vaccination, the indication position (person has a claim for an vaccination based on coronary disease and no reason to speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in allergic reactions (I have never happened).
The vaccination itself is delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In impfeams, however, we often do not have any, but "only" (for God don't want any missing value!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of the vaccine, but which cannot carry out vaccines (must?), so that I carry out most of the vaccines myself.
Heavy "Huidler" question: Amberger knows the solution
What's a "Huidler" please?
With this dialectic word, sent by an Amberger, the BR TV broadcast "We in Bayern" has been provided for intense thought.
But unlike in many days before, the term remained in the series "Host me?" this time unraveled by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And no one who's got to go fast.
That, the people heard from the TV moderator, was completely wrong.
On what did the man from Amberg communicate the solution and thus probably also provide for surprises in many upper floors.
"The Hüidlers," the audience experienced, "it's a stick with which someone picks the oven."
Dialectr Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed by Bavarian TV for years as an expert, confirmed this.
Noting that this is a typical top-of-the-False term, it is somehow derived from the rather well-known word "Hauders".
What was a success in education - perhaps even in a number of people who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books in two weeks.
There is always the following error message after confirmation: oops - something is wrong - try again later.
I re-started the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, synchronized and repaired with the PC.
It didn't help.
The tyre selection in the race-cycle really is so cool?
Today, I am fully awake today because I wanted at least a little training to prepare for my bike tour in the coming week.
I said, I did, and I drove with my bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what is going on in every town (this time: Thank you Krefeld!).
Glass splitter on the track.
Zack, loud pockets and my back ribs didn't want to take the rest of the track in any case.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement suit and replacement hose due to the week's day, I had to turn around with half a bad lounge and take the first train home.
It was also not so bad that I would be better if I did it with the tire change before the bike tour.
But now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long journey over several days before me, I would get very close to this problem more often.
Now it wasn't really bad, because even the old tires of the predecessor (very nice old man, the day I came to pick up the bike up to 14 o'clock 120km!) and who had already described it as suboptimal because he had been on the role with them for several years.
But if I think that when I drive 80-90km, I have to make another tire change, then I think I'm really badly rewarded :D
Now I came to the interview with an older man on the train, who was surprised to ask me why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; they should be inflatable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very attractive.
But are these really so incapacitated?
I have little desire to spend 40€/rail now, just to be disappointed.
I'm also asking myself: I'm on the racetrack at the moment I think 25x622.
There are also (probably?) at the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend other tires to me on a racing wheel?
The wwalbe-page seems to my absolute! Laiewisen prefer to recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you already in advance for the help and loving greetings!
Car sled against tree: driver injured fatally
The 53-year-old was beaten on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an unexplained cause against a central island and then hit the counterroads, as the police reported.
There it came to a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old car was then pushed against a tree and the man stuck in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old companion were severely injured in the accident and taken to surrounding hospitals.

After the release of our new High End broadband B 100-6 OHM it was just a matter of time until our SOLO series would get new.
SOLO 15 is called the new Sprøssling and is an optical reminder of the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this proposal, a suitable design foot is included directly in order to raise the speaker to the correct voice position.
This has no influence on acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
The principle is that SOLO 15 is very well suited for people with a more subordinate role in the maximum volume, but is expected to achieve an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to produce almost unfiltered large signal pressure level.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it grows considerably and is very impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonal was matched the SOLO 15 with a slight height rise.
This is generally used in broadband to optimize the high frequencies of highly increasing bonding.
The SOLO 15 with a very clear and fine sound is located exactly on the hearing area.
Lightly rotated outwards can reduce the high volume range and thus make the sound image warmer.
Thanks to the puncture source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereodreieck messersharf and stunningly precise.
The extremely low mechanical loss of the B 100 - 6 OHM by reference suspect ensures a fine dynamism that is looking for the same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but expands it in matters of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of our works, it is recommended to start thinking about the final vision of the speaker to plan appropriate changes in the construction process.
For example, if the case is to be handled, the reduction of the speaker needs to be adjusted accordingly, as the Furnier re-lays the material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the floor plate at the appropriate place to be able to run the cable without any problems later.
With the help of an upper-bred, the opening of the speaker in the front follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used later.
On the other hand, this opening should be provided with a 45° phase in order to form the opening area of the speaker box within as much as possible.
The four screwpoints of B 100 - 6 OHM will be interrupted in the phase, as shown in the "Detail Phase" picture.
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two sides on a flat surface.
On these, the back wall, the ceiling, the front and the floor are lined up.
The three suspensions should also be applied and glued.
The suspensions themselves may vary in material strength if, for example, they want to withdraw from the construction market, instead of producing them from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page will be added.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, that is, the two sides, as well as the front.
The opening of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection adhesive on the back wall, shall be facilitated by means of a suitable hole or drill drill.
Then you use a round hair to round all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footboard can also be rounded off.
After that, the footplate is firmly glued with the foot of the house and also screwed with long wooden screws.
It follows the drawing and drilling (2.5 mm drills) of the screwing points of the speaker box and the coupling clamp.
After the housing of wood dust has been cleaned (swallowing/swallowing), you start with the laying of the cable.
The simplest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
The entire and uncut cable is moved for pieces through the 8 mm drilling in the foot until the terminal opening and it can stand out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the house, the cable is led to the opening of the speaker and it is also easy to hang out there.
The frequency deviation is then prepared and used.
The construction plan of the frequency deviations, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document: Installation instructions Weiche Solo 15.
If the frequency swivel is installed and the connection terminal is scratched, the closing of the 8 mm cable opening in the box, which is not completely closed, follows.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some gear, heat glues can be dropped onto the opening and closed.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, you can check the closure accordingly.
Now the evaporation follows according to the description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected to the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus wire (marked cable) must be killed at the pluspol of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened and inserted to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube).
For evaporation, a matt of the evaporative material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed into the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I give up an order now and let the beginning of June be delivered?
> Hello all,
> finally we can announce that we are also organizing the OSCAST this year!
> Unfortunately, for known reasons, it is not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which means a higher planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people per switch so that we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid Delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still before the pandemic – yet we'll give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will be released at about 0:30.
Have a cold drink, plan good food and prepare for a long, but very interesting night.
