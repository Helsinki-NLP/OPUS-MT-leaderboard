The Czech Social Democrats in Prague don't know the place of worship or the "conditories".
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The Aktuálně.cz newspaper has once "closed off" members of the new Council from the ČSSD, as they rule the notorical snake that has migrated in recent years, in which the present coalition partners in Prague were at the Ruder.
The coded word treasure introduced in the scared era by Mayor Pavel Bém of Prague's political elite is one of the most famous actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, the new councils in relation to which these new terms are getting something in the dark proved to be.
At least they said that.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I am rather a new man in Prague politics," said Lukas Kaucký, the new Councilman for Culture, responding to the "Patinian Dictionary" test.
But also the Councillor Karel Brézina - a political veteran - reacted similarly.
For example, the term "golfloch".
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here, which I will use again and again."
"Or else I don't think much of snake."
Out of the vocabulary published by Aktuální.cz in June this year in front of the ODS election congress, the editorial took out six terms, especially those that are notorically connected with the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "the largest Prague Golfloch", "go to the Konditorei", "Stenaracken", "Truth of the Capital" and "relocating".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of Prague School - promised first his participation in the conversation, but then did not even take the audience away.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things, and I don't judge how the citizens' Democrats are dealing with each other."
"For me, it is important how we understand ourselves in our programmes," he said.
As already indicated, Lukas Kaucký in the above-mentioned strike lines would not have reportedly recognized that the talk was made by the influential entrepreneur and friend of former mayor Bem, Roman Janousek.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all and the only term he got right during the test was "the biggest Prague Golf Loch".
"That's the Blanka Tunnel," says Kaucký, but added to the security: "But I know that from the paper."
And jokingly, "I'm going to have to take a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then not only from Matador Karel Březina, but also from the head of the Council for Environmental Affairs Lukaš Plachý as a tunnel Blanka.
But both Social Democrats also know for whom is the term Voldemort and Lukas Plachý even knows where to find this figure and what it means to "go to the confectionery".
"I think that means to go into some Prague gastronomy operation," Plachý is pretty close to the puzzle solution when you know that this is the seat of Janousek companies.
In agreement with Brézina, however, he admires having created these knowledge from the paper rather than that he would own this treasure of speech.
According to the decision of the test participants, it does not seem that there is a similar civilized serpent among the Social Democrats.
"I have also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing with us."
"We call ourselves by name, and again we also use shorts or peaks," says the president of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulinský - named by his party-owned salop "Hulda".
"In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina told us.
The newspaper Dník Aktuální.cz has tried the name and see there - it works.
Counsellor Weinert is friendly to the "Opa" or less friendly to the "Old", the representative of Miroslav Poche, who took note before the elections by means of the party sponsorships, is called "Igráček" (known Czech lego figure) by some colleagues.
Top marks are the only one that allows the Social Democrats to use their own language.
Hulinský may not do so if he is called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another sign of Prague's president.
His chief name "Doctor of Gummiknüppel-Recht" is allegedly to do with the fact that Petr Hulinský acquired his title Doctor juris at the Bratislaver Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "Hexen" and issue a brochure
Women who are stamped in Burkina Faso as witches usually show some common social characteristics.
They belong to the older generation, they find no work - for example for health reasons, they are free and have no children.
If one of these women becomes a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot be dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are very rarely affected by this fate."
"Even young and healthy women remain spared because they help with work and bear children," a sister describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home for more than a hundred women who have been expelled from their communities.
The local government has now decided to oppose this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, a brochure was issued to stop the "hexen pursuit".
But the thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the newspaper "the standard" pointed to the dilemma of written explanation.
To be seen is also to be seen in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemahová was tortured by three women and two men to death - they overrun them with petroleum and just lit them.
This incident was reported by the BBC server, among other things.
The perpetrators claimed, however, that the matter would have been only a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to your version, oil that will be used for ritual saves is leaked.
And yet, after the group tried to "dispel a wicked spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "Hexen" here supports people regardless of their education.
"The Standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying, "The nurses of human souls are a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to narrow down the Hexenjagd, the Gambian President himself has been involved in a proper way last year.
"President Yahya Jammeh invented a monster witch hunt after the death of his aunt, as they allegedly had a share of their death and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"He called for the help of shamane from the nearby Guinea who, along with policemen, soldiers and the president's bodyguard, violently kidnapped women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the president's farm in Kanilai," said the Amnesty International in her report.
On the farm, the infirm people were forced to drink an absud from plants with hallucinogenic effects, but also caused stomach and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
It was only because of international pressure that almost a thousand prisoners were released again.
A tenant of Bacala: He heats in the oven - yet he pays higher rent
An older man is leaving the client centre of the company RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zdeněk Bacala, the largest owner of private apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a folder with three new leases to three apartments: for the own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is incarcerating a prison sentence.
All three were just increased in terms of the so-called deregulation.
Instead of 3500 kroner monthly rentals, the son will pick up 4100 kroner next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen in the second category.
"And there's not even running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal oven," he says angryly with the finger on the new contract of the son's rental, to which he has a full power.
"But what - I signed," he explains half agreed and half resignated.
The BytyOKD.cz, which described the new terms of rental as "incorrect and immoral", advises the tenants not simply to sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December, where it intends to publish a guide as it is intended against such contracts.
But the man's only out of business.
"One says this, the other says that," he makes a window face.
The Ostrava region becomes the largest deregulation laboratory.
After a new year, this deregulation is before most of the rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not yet paid marketable rent.
Actuálně.cz decided to visit this "labor" personally.
The RPG Warterarum in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine in the morning this Tuesday is breaking up.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a call device with it.
"Meet 2011", a special key field on the touchscreen is lit.
Briefly typed and the device is already ticking out a number list.
We have hardly deciphered the number "157" and already peeks it on the large display on the roof of the waiting room.
A half a second later, you're on the line.
A little later an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rental.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repairs, insurance matters and so on.
From mid-November in the region of Ostrava, the envelopes with the new rental contracts are the most tenants of the 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio into the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty suggests in the letters an increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special switch for new rentals in the customer centre has been open since 18 November.
"The action runs a little over a week, which means it's only the beginning," the ladies behind the switch answer after a moment when the "client" emerges as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bacala's former mining apartments are a brilliant theme.
Before the elections, the President-in-Office of the European Parliament, Lubomír Zaorálek, who is from Ostrava, had taken this issue quite seriously, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new footing from them."
"Don't worry. WC-Brille could change them," says the man mentioned at the outset.
To date, according to employees, above all the tenants on the switch, in order to be sure that they will receive the promised rent reduction that RPG promises them when they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants who sign the new lease by 15 December are also expected to benefit from a half-retirement lease.
So far, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is everything but overloaded by requests.
"Only 40 to 50 of the rents were from the 360 customers in 2011 because of this," the Schalterbeintens estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on both their websites and wall tables where it appears necessary.
But if the rental parties do not agree to the new rental, they will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but it is as information about the only legitimate legal procedure to be understood," explains RPG on his website.
"No one goes to court here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client centre gives her at least part of it.
"I have 13,000 (Chrones) rents, of which 5,000 are left for food, where I should take the money for a trial," he says.
Then the employees will be insecure.
"Look at this."
"Lord Zaorálek tells them about the media that they are not going to sign and so the people are still waiting," she says.
The regulated rental ends in most of the Czech Republic to New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rental increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing height of the rent is not enough for the maintenance of the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimès, director of the apartment portfolio of the company RPG Byty, and - precisely the neglect of the housing fund criticised by the tenants is, in the opinion of the homeowners, the main reason for the increase in rent.
While RPG was able to invest in the apartments from the rentals received between 2005 and 2010, it is expected to be 5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the deck in front of the wrist chairs in the Havířov waiting room, a few red lighting information is emerging again and again.
"The rental increases in 2011 are 15% and less for 31 200 apartments, which means more than 90% of the apartments of RPG."
"Always this means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter and month", is to be read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the Portfolio of RPG increase the rental by 38 percent.
"In these cases there is an extremely low rental price increase of 19.66 CZK per square meter," RPG argues.
At 2600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same height next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not cause the rents to jump upwards, but is gradually taking place within four and eight years.
What's more - the company has another obligation: All income from the rent increase (see diagram) wants to reintroduce the company into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in the heating barrier.
But, above all, they are to benefit from those who sign the agreements on the rise.
Architects saw a - the office also includes a kindergarten
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-child garden here, including all of it: colourful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-playing space on the outside terrace.
This children's garden has been available to Arch.Design employees since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, from which the studios come from a whole series of famous brünner buildings, calculated from the first designs for the new building of Avriopoint with the space for its company mini-garden gardens.
In view of this, most of his 90 employees (inside) are in the babyboom age and the company is located to return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility of short work, the kindergarten is another bonus, the Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of its social program.
The builders and architects have so much easier to bring their demanding profession and child care under a hat.
The mini-child garden is an original idea of the employees (inside) of Arch.Design and with the support of management, they managed to earn funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operating mini-child garden is financed by the Operational Programme of Human Resources and Employment Policy through the European Social Fund and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (CZK 2.8 million grants), the necessary facilities and equipment could be obtained and for the duration of 2 years it is provided for qualified staff and for the operation.
The company Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the mini-child garden for another 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took place for a whole year, with effective assistance from the company Economy Rating in the processing of applications.
In order to care for the children, fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, children can visit the kindergarten without age limits, although most of them are over three years of age.
And since this is a mini-child garden, only 5 children may be present at the same time, however, the day varies over several children.
The child garden is flexible to the needs of the parents, who have the same rights in relation to the use of the child garden - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the content of the programme in the mini-child garden is nevertheless comparable to the framework programme for pre-school education.
The children are not only playing here, but above all they will be given excellent education - from basic knowledge to pre-school education, as well as learning English.
The classroom is not only with toys and creative games, but also equipped with a computer that is available to children.
What is more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus avoid the stress of late pick-up of the children from a far-off kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their working time more productively.
No wonder there are natural and loyal employers' relationships.
Arch.Design was chosen by the Czech companies, which offer significant benefits in the recruitment of new employees, which are family-friendly and through such programs strengthen their staff marketing.
A bone house also fascinates after 100 years. Check out the interiors of Gaudi
The roof encourages like the back of a prehistoric oak, the stairs like the spines of a dinosaur and the balconies are razed fish mills.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the inhabitants of the house, the house with its organic forms received the top names "Knochenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaics, the facades and all-modern soft lines, all of which are typical features of Antonio Gaudi's youth style.
The facade of the house plays with dreamy lines, loving colors and textures that remind nature and life.
Only in a more precise sense is it observed that everything is governed by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
In the night, the whole facade still works plastic, dramatic, and special lighting enhances the brightness of the colors.
The same floating lines and curved shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Valve-shaped wood copies the window frames, joints, seal elements of doors, even gecko holes and performances.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the inhabited shopping street Passeig de Gràcia No. 43 was created by the construction of a house from 1877, the architect Emilio Sala Cortese performed.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, was originally on the brink of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but finally he agreed to the idea of Gaudís to an unusual and even cheaper conversion.
However, the rental house Casa Batlló did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative home of the real estate owner and also the use of mosaics on the facade were his idea.
However, many other artists and artists also worked with the design of the façade.
The joint work on the drafts for Casa Batlló was the beginning of fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís Haus Casa Milá in Park Güell, where there are also other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was acquired by the residents of its organic forms due to the "Knochenhaus".
In turn, others called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "dwelling house".
It is also said that on top of the building, the sword of the holy Georg, the patron of Catalonia is represented.
But also other picturesque elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a unique central heating system with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces for the time being.
Something strange is encouraging their 45-degree trend.
In his creation, Gaudí ignored all the construction regulations and was not allowed to depart from them.
Before the beginning of construction, he obtained the relevant building permit from the city, but the information he had made about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city fathers were so dissipated two years later at the completion of the project that they requested relief.
Among other things, the councillors also agreed that the construction with its arrows would even interfere with public citizens.
However, there was no change, on the contrary - only fifteen days after this call for the city district, Josep Batlló applied for approval of the rental of the two top-level buildings of the house - and it was quickly granted to him.
The housekeeper himself entered the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a living room, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was banned at a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building passes a staircase up to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reconstruction have removed all right angles and straight lines and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí, however, also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of spaces.
The social part can be fully connected through the opening of the salon doors, and thus a larger society could easily complain, without having to give up a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
In addition to a new facade, Gaudís Umbau also received a fairly unusual roof and two other floors.
Gaudís is also impressive game with the light as well as the blue and white glass tiles with which the inner courtyard is decorated and the lighthouses.
The game of these two colours gives a maximum light to all the floors of the house.
He simply made use of the principle that White better reflects the light than dark colors that absorb the sunlight on the contrary.
The Casa Batlló house, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can visit today anyone.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment of the public is made available.
The houseowners decided to take this step only in the year and this from the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was found that this was a rather effective business, the visits were held, yes, they were also extended to other common and roofing spaces, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the building site is not a paper chair, it is 16,50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist exhibits get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entry prices to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Anyone who wants to know the true atmosphere of the house with his dragon towers should try to close friendship with one of the house dwellers and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rest? Women have desires other than men
Not the finest beds, but the quality of the surface - so mattresses and rust make the good bed.
However, these must be complemented harmoniously in order to satisfy the user's wishes.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the size, the state of health and not least the sex of the sleeper.
Also important is the interior in which mattresses and rust are subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they need much longer to "be warm".
In addition, they are significantly more difficult than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And they should be returned regularly.
If they do not have enough vents in the core and are still on a fixed plate, moisture is due to: it is not excluded that they form under their mold.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
Anyone who has been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses are common with soft layer, will find it difficult to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
"Even though all the ice hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained that they can't sleep right here anymore."
"For their hidden shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a visco foam soft layer (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer)."
"I recommend these, among other things, also sugar-sick people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and the skin badly," explains Sylva Hadamczyková, who specializes in powder furniture.
That is why I have provided many ice hockey players years ago, but also other customers with Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of Visco foam.
This "Wonderful" is actually very simple.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it regularly interferes with the warm body.
Nowhere does it push, in the night you don't roll around like after a difficult fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
In addition, the viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (Wundbrand).
When selecting the size of the mattresses, you should still calculate the length of the soles, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Men like women who are 180 cm in size need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the bedrooms should be at least 90 cm wide, i.e. 180 cm wide.
For single beds, for example, for single beds, 120 to 140 cm are fitted.
The comfort is half and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule applies to the ideal bed width: "If you are on the back, there should still be enough room for the slightly angled arms," says Helena Prokopová, the master of the wrists and room replacements, who has been devoted for years to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture, and this subject is also presented in specialized schools.
With a double bed, each needs his own rust and his own mattresses, but watch out when shopping so that the mattresses are the same.
Otherwise, nothing else remains than mounting the rust at different heights and this is not possible at all at bedtimes.
Shadow mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which should be at least three centimeters on the shape layer and the fine powder.
"With the hand or by inserting, you can't feel the feathers at all," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully ground beds with mattresses and ground floor like grown Siams will have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses can't breathe and the relationship can't wash what's already going on and running today.
And since one night you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years becomes slowly to a giant (and hidden seven).
For this reason, professionals reject advertising, which promise a lifetime of up to 25 years, even lifelong guarantees.
She's got all the things she's got, but she's got them.
Therefore, a practical advice from traders: In mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, the hygiene of washable, removable links should not be seen, but it is recommended to use a mattress cleaner that can be easily removed and washed.
Even if today, usually, mattresses are made with round-row closures, so that after opening you get two halfs (often important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially performed alone, often like the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a hard plate in the bed instead of a rock?
Get out of here!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for one night only.
Also, they should prefer to use the plate with air holes (if not already inside) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring cores and fine powders.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a base.
For non-adjustable lattenroste with 14 to 18 latres (lamelles), latex or sandwich mattresses (e.g. combinations of latex and coconuts) are suitable, always pay for lattre with a larger number of lattres, i.e. 28 and more lattres, with Lord dose support in the lumbar area and the ability to regulate latten hardness.
There are no mattresses with spring skeletons on adjustable lamella rust, as they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to the setting of the stairwells, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is a special fixation of the spring wires, which enables the spring wires to be printed or even parallel so that they can allow the point-insect of the shoulder of the sleeper.
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have begun to use soft zones for the shoulder area at "Lord mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they like these soft zones in the main area.
For most demanding customers, point-elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or rust with point-elastic contact paths with so-called multitorsion suspension are determined.
The pressure is distributed to several points, reducing the tension.
But - if you use a bad (too big and full) head pockets for the right mattress and right rust, most advantages are lost again.
Here too is a rule: the head cushion should support the head, its tips should reach only to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm large pillow appears, such as the Scandinavia.
In the side compartment, the head cushion (with the shoulder load zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should equal the shoulder height.
Something has our modern mattresses share with the single (filled with heu) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their mixtures.
Also in mattresses is the new magic word "Bio".
Instead of petroleum, we use more and more natural oils to produce polyurethane foams - such as rice and soybean oil.
Soja is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is called matrazzen, which is the core of natural materials," explains Petr Vaszíček from the company Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattresses - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
However, you can also enjoy microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender fragrance while sleeping.
Here too you make a difference between a man and a woman.
While men use a "cooler" plant extract from birch leaves to absorb the heat and cool the body, the relationships for women have a "cooling" effect.
Extracts from red paprikas shoes are the result of blood circulation, so the weaker gender becomes warm when sleeping.
And today's favorites?
Matrats from cold foam (he has larger pores with damaged cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffs (hard) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where head, hips and ferns are located.
For a high quality mattress, however, you have 7,000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually charged with lower VAT, as they are considered as medical aids.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was granted this advantage.
It's not that easy to save on the mattress and the rust.
Over and over there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses at the price of one offer.
This is how the Magniflex brand offers the mattress duofreeze with respect to hidden visco foam memory for 11,990 CZK.
The second one gets free of charge.
It was the material tempur that introduced the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density into almost cosmic tempo.
No wonder they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are subjected to enormous overload at the start.
Tempur is soft when warm, in cool environment it is attached again.
This fits perfectly with the human body and optimally distributes the body pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal to prevent pressure from burning, but it generally increases the comfort of sleeping.
Viscoelastic foams, however, are used not only for mattresses, but also for other health products, such as for special foot powders, which are intended to facilitate the legs and feet.
For example, home manufacturers use foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to control the kids
The fear of their own children grows and so more and more parents consider monitoring them through GPS.
The system, originally designed to go to cars, can also be good people, which in such cases would also be helpful, as in the recent disappearance of the nine-year-old Anicka Janatková.
The device is now about as big as a cigarette box, but soon it should not be larger than an armband watch.
Many people have put the case of the missing Anička in fear and fear and thus keep them looking at ways and means to better protect their children.
Also for the price of damage to their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that it is not about spying around, but about an effective means to reduce the likelihood of tragedy," Petr Pilin, from the company Macro Weil, points to one of the suppliers of GPS equipment on the Czech market.
"I admit that it can happen in a case of abuse of such devices, for example if you put it in someone's pocket without him knowing it, but we didn't have to record such a case so far."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know the purpose of the "schachtel" and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočkova points out that if a child does not want to wear such a thing, it simply departs.
"Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things deliberately if they don't want to be controlled."
"At first, the phones raised great expectations with the parents, but they can easily be switched off just like these new surveillance devices," says Mrs Bočkova.
In your opinion, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In planned kidnappings, the child is virtually always checking whether the child has any electronics with which it could be arranged."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such monitoring devices were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for them, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, police criminals are always a step ahead," says psychologists.
However, it assumes that similar devices can be quite helpful in the event of a sudden attack by a paedophile.
Roberta Čech from the company RC Monitoring, which offers location services for both cars and persons, can also help with the existence of such a device if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted in such a way that it will report the position at certain intervals."
"Even if it was destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"With expensive devices, even a tensile meter is integrated, which means that if you fall down and lie down unmoved, the device sends a warning immediately under the heading," says Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also make intelligent mobile phones with navigation, you just need to play a special software.
The problem with the current location devices is that it is either a device in striege wood box size, the trailers are similar or smaller phones.
There's always the danger of losing it.
According to the Macro Weil, Mr Pilin is therefore tested in the present devices that look like normal digital clocks.
"This has the advantage that any attacker must not at all recognize that it is a surveillance or location device.
"Or he only notices after a certain time what the police give a time-incentive," he adds.
No matter what direction the development takes - to arms or trailers, the same technology is always used, as in the vehicle location.
So for the combination of location function using the GPS system (as well as the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many dentures that you can transform the whole Czech Republic but you can only hold for two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometres of ignition, with blasts being burned.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometres of tin to the army camp.
It is comforting to know that the forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the denture - two, but at most four years.
The army bought the closures from the stock company STV Group, i.e. 40 million crowns.
In his explanation for the purchase of this huge amount of Zündschnur, the MF DNES General Staff responded, the soldiers would consume the 60 kilometres of Zündschnur annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnics, which MF DNES called for, it follows from this statement that the entire army had to complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army commanders, to the secretaries and wives.
Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondra and Lieutenant General Vlastimil Picek are not exempt.
This was the only way to justify the considerable annual consumption of 60 kilometres of furnaces.
This length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But this too would be the case for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts still applies that for the training of every new professional soldier, two meters full of seal, then the army has created a calming warehouse for the 225 years already mentioned by these new purchases - even in view of the increased need of the pioneer and special units.
Soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade complained to Minister of Defense Vondra soon, they had almost no patterns for handguns anymore, so that the lack of funds was severely restricted.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
"I don't know why they buy from us such a lot of dentures."
But that is their decision, and they will know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we would most like to oppose as a dealer," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Defense, is responsible for the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of Zündschnur so that the army would have covered itself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký from the STV Group, however, speaks only of a four-year period of use of the fireworks and police and army pyrotechnics for only two years.
"In perfect storage, the four years mentioned may also be possible," says one of them, but who wants to remain anonymous so as not to be exposed as a soldier to the criticism of the army.
After the expiry of the period of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether it is still reliable and not endangering the lives of the soldiers.
But these tests are not unfair, but they cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the reduction of the quantity for the 445 kilometres of ignition.
"They cost us 60 percent less than the last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," the spokesperson Pejšek tells us the position of the defence department's buyers.
Only for comparison: The annual consumption of fireworks from police pyrotechnics, the ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brotherhood, has been almost 1,500 metres long.
And the police always order only such quantities of this ammunition that they can consume before the expiry of the period of use.
Because of the safety of pyrotechnics, it is also possible to buy more modern and therefore reliable burns.
Nevertheless, the Ministry of Defence has enormous problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand head Czechoslovak people's army prepared for the Rhine on its campaign.
According to the pyrotechnics, who claimed MF DNAS, the Czech forces expect the same problem in a few years when liquidating hundreds of kilometres of old dentures, which they have purchased today so "funny".
To this day, the contacts that I have gained through competition will come to my attention.
The strong placement in the competition "Little entrepreneurs of the year" helped Lukas Pytloun to sell the Franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the last year of the competition "Ministry of the Year" was Lukáš Pytlou from Liberec.
The story of his success encourages like a movie scenario.
Lucas Pytloun will be glad to see you.
Only abroad did he realize that there was a lack of reasonable prices in Liberec.
Out of the savings from his work abroad and through a bank loan, he created a house with five apartments.
Considering that he was then a high school student in the sixth semester, this must have been a brave undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at the time upset me, and so I tried to do something against it," says Lukas Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented to foreign workers.
He immediately invested in the house, which he then converted into a step-by-step pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has been able to open in just seven years of business activity in Liberec four pensions, two closed restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was the 4th hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tísé, which we sold our Franchise concept and other stakeholders at the Franchise of Pytloun hotels have already reported," says the Entrepreneur Number One from last year.
"A large share of this license sale for the operation of hotels had just won in the competition "undertaking of the year," Mr. Pytloun added.
The victory has brought him greater popularity, yes popularity in Liberec and the environment.
"The people recognized me on the street, often congratulated me afterwards, and I have to say that it did really well," he recalls.
I really recommend that everyone who wants to create something participate in this competition.
You don't have to win at the same time, every visualization is good.
He says that he still benefits from the contacts and acquaintances that would otherwise not have come to.
"With some of the people I have met thanks to competition, I maintain regular business relations to this day."
The fame associated with success, according to his opinion, is a little down on every employee.
And there he is at the age of seventy.
"I note with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is given general recognition."
I also see this not only as personal success, no, that is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just a little stuck in the foreground," says Lukáš Pytloun modest.
I wish my followers a calmer year when we had it in a farm
The victory forum was quickly resolved by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his goal, Farm has the worst behind him.
The price for the first rank of the competition Vodafone Company of the year in the past year was taken by Karel Žjárský, the owner of the farm.
At that time, the jury appreciated the efforts he made to get a company from the small tool building in Česká Skalice, making hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this recognition not only encourages me, but also encourages all my employees and has strengthened our self-consciousness in the fight against competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of the company's history of farm was the effort to do something useful.
And when the state offered his father Karel Žjárský as a compensation for the property seized by the communists, he did not hesitate long, left his career in the company in which he had been employed, and set up with a few friends of his father's own company for the production of plastics.
Shortly thereafter, they began to focus on plant oil.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But only because of the success of the competition mentioned and its mediaization has it also entered into the consciousness of non-professionalism.
"Not only that our customers now experience the Farm brand significantly more intensively, our foreign partners also began to work together with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country," says Karel Jjdárský.
Last year, however, Farm did not just stand in the sign of the victory forum.
The assessment was based on the company’s economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the toughest year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which affected the citizens at the time, but above all the businesses, reached its peak - many companies were forced to set up their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course, we couldn't get away with this."
"The sales went back by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even grab discounts," explains Karel Žjárský.
A viable company must also take such unpopular measures.
However, it was possible to get the situation in the grip and keep the company in the black numbers, even with less profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was not willing to withdraw - in the case of investment in research and development.
"From the grant, we built a research and training centre, strengthened our presentation at international fairs and acquired major awards at domestic exhibitions," says Jjdárský.
Everything proves that we've overcome the crisis.
The sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner much joy at the victory - but in a calmer atmosphere," Karel Jjárský points out.
A question of opinion which is covered by unreasonable rules
The question of "absoluteness of the year" is the fourth part of the competition.
Some foolish rules have already been created from the world.
To doubt the winners of the next year's opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" the obligation to create documents on authorities that are available online.
Thus, more than a third of non-qualitative companies decided.
Thus the Social Insurance Administration requested a paper extract from the trade register, even if the official could have picked it up by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is changing.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require any extracts from the trade register in the future when social insurance payments are controlled," ČSSZ spokesperson Jana Buranová said.
The meaning and purpose of the opinion poll "absorbity of the year" is to take all the rules and arrangements under the loop, to meet the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to lift the senseless.
This year is the fourth part of a competition organised by the so-called Economic Journal (HN) and is pleased with the growing popularity of the public.
If three thousand people took part in the vote last year, it was already four thousand in this year.
No wonder, for there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve only and alone to hinder business.
"For example, as regards the number of income tax forms, we take a leading rank in the world," notes Karel Havlíček from the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and traders of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurship is the proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic has improved little.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic takes the 74th rank in terms of business conditions, a worse ranking of around eight places compared to the previous year.
The year's absurdity competition was first called out in the year and is playing out every year after the same scenario.
From April to the conclusion of the competition, anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense at the end of September.
For registration, the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then the competition organizer is looking for seven candidates for the "anti-price" and allows the public to vote on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It beats the absurdity that gets most votes.
For this year's opinion poll, more than one hundred and more, 105 meaningless rules and regulations have been reported.
The tips are not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
For example, among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are also provisions that maintenance vehicles have to pay for motorways and high-speed roads or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must present every two years.
The list of this year's "Sieben" is published on the sides of the competition.
The opening of the competition each beginning of November at Prague Wenzelsplatz is part of an event in which political and public life also regularly participates.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of Small or Medium-sized Enterprises and Business Operators of the Czech Republic and Petr Kužel, the President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic at the height of the competition with the party.
"Where the state throws business ties between the legs, there can be no real economic upheaval, so my goal is to lift at least thirty paragraphs each year, which are still unnecessary for entrepreneurs today," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Commerce.
Efforts to create foolish orders from the world show an effect.
In 2007, most of the people were forced to report to the company on their permanent place of business three days in advance of their intention to go to an exhibition or Kirmes.
This obligation was lifted by a novelty of the trade law.
The duty, which was given the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the duty to report to the Labour Office the services of employees for up to 30 days - was abolished by the Act on the so-called "Green Card".
And all the good things are three:
To the absurdity of 2009, the regulation, which put in place physiotherapists, was chosen to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two passenger cars in the talking room.
This regulation has been adjourned by the Ministry of Health this year to some extent - the refrigeration obligation has fallen.
A new category of corporate responsibility deserves
Assessment criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A new feature in this year's fifth year of competition of the Economic Journal (HN) is the category "Responsive Company of the Year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote sensible and fair enterprises.
"We want to support such companies that are aware of the consequences of your business activity and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrick Bartholdy, regional manager of Vodafon's mobile phone company, the caller and guarantor of this competition, as well as the "Rebell of the Year" competition.
For this year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company of the year notified companies for which success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and fine enough fabric for an independent article.
Although they differ in the subject matter of their diametrical activity, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
For example, this is about disabled people, as it is about personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera also appeared, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady is also very concerned about its health-inhibited employees, who make up 70 per cent of their staff, for which it was valued by the title "Responsive Company of the Region of Central Böhmen"; in the competition Vodafone Company of the Year, it presented the third rank in the context of this region.
In the Olomouc region, the bookkeeping company MiRyz Soft was able to introduce a liquid and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours per week, without a relative reduction in wages.
The jury also honored the fact that the company purchases mainly from Czech producers, supports citizens' initiatives in its environment and works in accordance with environmentally friendly principles.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible to keep the consequences of our business activity and administration as little as possible for the environment," explains Managing Director Milosze Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the region of Ústí nad Labm is also located in the health of its employees and has therefore created ergonomic chairs and keyboards for all notebooks, and also encourages them to use the mapping services provided by a home-protected workshop during their work and business operations.
"In addition, we support the "People in Need" Foundation, which provides concrete help to the Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the representative of the company.
Not least is the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čisčtní" from the Karlsbader region, which contributes to their pension insurance to their employees in the form of extra bonuses.
"We provide our employees with contributions to the maintenance, the work path, the promotion of their skills and the holiday," says Josef Strapáč of the Czasch construction company from Bruntál, the winner of the Maurish-Schlesian region.
To the category Responsibilities company of the year were automatically registered by all the district finalists of the competition Vodafon company of the year who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer by August 15th.
Wrong or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the law firms were left unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "Responsible Company of the Year", but they were not disqualified in the main competition Vodafone Company of the year."
"A separate application for this competition is not possible only because it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman by the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Ground Fund - arrests of the police at a public tender
In the building of the Pilsen Land Fund, the anti-corruption police carried out arrests in the last few days.
In doing so, the home media contractor and real estate dealer Luboš G. was taken over by the detectives in handcuffs.
It had allegedly tried to manipulate a direct public competition to deal with claims for reimbursement in such a way that the assets offered in the competition were of particular interest.
This will have paid Luboš G. half a million for it.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person because of the delinquency of fraudulent matrimonials in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner Public Prosecutor of the "Právo" newspaper, could not provide further details regarding the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released from the police.
In what way could he manipulate public competition, one can only speculate in view of the special official information.
The speaker of the Land Fund Lubomír Černá referred to Právo's question, which the police had actually arrested in the Pilsner in front of the Land Fund during a public competition.
"It was about a client and night for one of our employees," she said.
According to the public competition, Mrs Černá had the correct term "Debate for the submission of claims for the transfer of land under the Land Law" and would take place in cases where several applicants were interested in the proposed land.
"These persons, in the context of the call, offer a higher value of their claims to be settled by transfer than the value of the property called out."
"In accordance with the requirements offered, the order of potential buyers is determined, then the soil fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," explains the speaker of the fund.
Luboš G. was obviously available information, who had signed up for the call, and since he was a entitled person himself, since he had purchased a number of claims for restitution, he suggested that he withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat finding.
This would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money when he was arrested.
In the past, Luboš G. has had very good contacts with Pilsner Ground Fund.
In this way, he also played a role in the cause of the former head of the foundation Václav Sankota, which was prosecuted because he issued land in replacement refunds to which local decisions had already been taken on construction projects.
At that time, for example, Luboš G. from the Land Fund also acquired land which was intended to build public roads, more precisely, at the place where the construction of the access magistral was planned for the Borské pole area.
Later he exchanged it very favourably with the Magistrate against a house directly in the historic centre of the city, which exceeded the value of the land.
At that time, the town council had to offer a small heart to avoid endangering the construction project by blocking the plots.
Household living costs increase by a few hundred per month
As of January, households must not only calculate higher costs for all energy types, but also with higher water and sewage charges and for remote heat and elsewhere the rents also grow.
As of January, families will have to withdraw several hundred crowns each month from the wallet than ever before.
Power will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies, and in some places the remote heating supplies will also be depleted.
Only the power control costs the apartment budget a few hundred crowns per year.
The electricity prices have been reduced by all major suppliers, so it is due to the clear promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, particularly from photovoltaic power plants.
Gas, however, will only be more expensive if people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
So here too is to be calculated with a few hundred crowns per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive in all of the Czech Republic, the prices for remote heating from city to city vary.
Especially larger places plan price increases.
For example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay more monthly for remote heating up to 50 kroner, more than 1000 kroner per year for families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague are also threatened with 9 percent higher water and wastewater charges and this in the case that the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague is still among the lowest compared to the Czech Republic.
In the northern arc, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Huge rental price increases are expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments where the so-called rental regulation falls from January.
For example, the apartment company CPI Byty, which has 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase the rentals from January by a hundred percent.
Those who do not agree with this increase in rent will be interested in the company's legal interests.
The regulated rentals, which are still paid in about 300,000 apartments, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children drink with remote and Rum Beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, Rum and Wodka, except once again a good whiskey that was stolen from the house bar to the father.
These are the drinks, after which alcoholic Czech teenagers must be treated under fifteen at the most notable.
No exceptions are children who have to sleep in the hospital repeatedly.
This is reflected in the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the admission of child clinics.
"Beers or wine are completely out of fashion, because it just takes too long to get drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the head of the Children's Department in the Middle Bohemian Clinic of Hořovice.
"Whisky, if it succeeds in getting the father a bottle out of the house bar, and if not, then at least remote or wodka.
"Wodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then it doesn't smell so loud," explains the chief.
The speaker of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him the right.
"Most of all, it's about distance or space."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially at primary schools."
"It was also about Slibowitz, which is taken from home," Mrs. Jurinová said.
According to Chefarzt Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers are no exception in hospital admission for a long time.
In front of the hospital in Hořovice, where he has been working for ten years since this year, he has been working in the Paediatric Department of the Hospital Motol, where the rescue car was delivered by students from nearby and remote areas.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"Your career began with 12 years when she was first delivered with 3.5 promille alcohol in the blood and still in combination with "extase", the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition site in Holešovice on some dance party."
"The interesting thing was that it wasn't unusual for her mother to say her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," says the chief.
Just the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance when attacking with their own spruces is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
To make a real addiction in the true sense of the word, there are no experts in children.
"In alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and this is not the case with these children."
In the case of those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is usually a negative family-social background," explains Chefarzt Pelikán.
According to the spokesperson of the Hospital Motol, Ms. Jurinová, about forty children drunk by mid-November were sent to the ward for child and youth medicine.
However, only cases of severe alcohol poisoning that require hospital stay are included in the statistics.
Deprived children who are brought home after an ambulance treatment by their parents or, where appropriate, by the police are not registered.
Apart from the cases in which children can only drink a bottle of snaps in the school bank, in the opinion of Mr. Pelikán, there are three year-old amplits on which one hundred percent is left: Walpurgisnocht, Silverester and the end of the school year.
"The latter was called for two reasons - either because of the bad witness or because of the joy of the holidays."
"In the Walpurgis night, I've also experienced seven drunken children at one time in the recording," says Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better than a child who has only to fight with an unpleasant cat the next day.
The headaches in the morning, which are caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be distributed in the hospital with a fluid-dependent infusion of glucose and nutrients that are missing the body.
"They're clearly better at it, because after the "wonderful" experience in the evening, they wake up with good laurel, without doing anything to hurt."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," says Dr. Pelikán, who saves the patients with at least the good pay by telling them the cost of the treatment.
Because the transport with the rescue car and the night in an emergency bed is good and likes to receive a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"I used it as a means of education once again, when I directly calculated to the children at the visit, what it cost them to be pregnant and that it can happen exactly that they have to work over the whole holiday to earn the money for a single such fat," said Dr. Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the hospitals do not intervene in return procedures in order to require the parents to pay the necessary costs for the care of the children who are drunk.
Two training planes L-159 for the first time in a foreign hand - in Spain
Two light battleplanes L-159 of a total of five, which were replaced by the Czech Ministry of Defence against the transport aircraft Casa C-295M, flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS sits.
It is the first time that machines of this type are owned by a foreign army.
In abroad, they were only seen at Manovern or airshows.
This is the two-axle version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are L-159.
These are still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the broker of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken over last week.
When they ship the aircraft physically from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, according to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence, is not yet known.
In turn, the L-159 single combat aircraft were isolated from long-term aircraft, without further investments and investments from the Ministry's location.
"The L-159T1 double seats were replaced in the current state and appearance," said Pejšek of the Právo newspaper.
He added that the army would not have to leave without two-six warplanes, as in May 2009, the Ministry of Defence signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody on the conversion of four superfluous L-159 to the two-six version.
A new aircraft has taken over the army in July, the second will take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed itself to carrying out the combat aircraft for the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the carrier of L-159 aircraft and that they should be used to train NATO pilots.
"It is therefore the matter of the receiver, how he realizes the matter," Pejšek said.
The Economic Journal (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not issued a tender procedure for purchase, but EADS spoke directly.
The defence office then argued that this exchange will support the future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 machines, of which only 24 were used, and the rest wanted to sell them.
The purchase of the aircraft Casa should also have a legal role.
The European Commission appealed to the Czech Ministry of Defence, namely the European Court of Justice.
The army has already taken over three aircraft from Casa, which is scheduled to land at Kbely Airport in the last fourteen days.
A longer sign finger than ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose fingers are longer than the ring finger are obviously exposed to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published by the British Journal of Cancer on Wednesday.
This is to be associated with the male hormone testosterone mirror.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, and this is particularly for men up to 60," explained the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health burdens, Mrs Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, while at the same time 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the sign finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability of prostate cancer was the same as for 19 percent of the men whose rings and signs were the same length.
However, in men whose sign finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk fell by 33 percent, in men up to 60 by 87 percent.
The ratio of the two fingers mentioned, which are already in prenatal age, clearly reflects the different mirrors of sex hormones that the child was exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer sign finger.
Previous research showed that the testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancers.
Václav Pačes, the leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told ČTK that he was aware of this study, yet he held the relationship between the length of the finger and the risk of cancer so far "not fully proven".
Czech Republic in snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the streets and roads, there is usually solid snow, winter servants were mostly on axles all night long.
The D5 motorway between kilometres 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is blocked due to some accidents of Lkws and Pkws and also the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague ".
Novinky.CZ said this by the shooters of the Central Auto Motor Club (UAMK).
At kilometre 91, an LKW was compromised, at kilometre 93, two Lkws collapsed, and in this accident there were injured.
There are also a few pkws in the street grave.
There are also problems at 185 kilometers of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Here too, two lkws have collapsed.
The drivers should leave at or above Brno at 190 kilometers and at 182 kilometers at Kývalka.
There are miles of staus.
On the D11, too, an accident happened and the same thing happened when you went to Prague.
In Prague itself is a several centimeter thick snowboard and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Autocolons form, for example, in Prosek, the street Štěrboholská is completely hidden.
The safest means of transport is at least the metro.
The highways run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Peace Square.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis staff will meet.
There are also problems at the railway and at the airport.
The Czech railway had to cancel seven high-speed connections due to snow travel.
There are problems, for example, on the Prague - Kralupy route or also Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should be informed of the current situation.
The airport Ruzyně has been closed since Wednesday 11 a.m. until 5 a.m.
Most of the roads in south-mären are only safe with increased caution.
At Vyškov, three side streets are completely inaccessible, in the vicinity of Brno, snow travels are apparently forming, and in the vicinity of Blanco, snowflakes are forced to be used on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are still three streets completely blocked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Sharatice - Mileshovice.
Here too you will have to use snowflakes to clean up snowflakes.
Once they are rehabilitated, they cannot be estimated until now.
In the Hodonín region, care is taken in the area of white carpathies.
On the streets which may be spread only with indoor currents for natural protection reasons, there is a thickness of up to five centimeters of snow cover, led by ČTK.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of neuschnee fell, most of them in the north - up to 18 centimeters.
In the Maurice-Schlesian region, up to 15 centimeters of neuschnee fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it is slow to cut.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The U.S. troops first used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, known to date only under their code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the force ratio to their advantage.
The new weapon is something like a super-precious cannon.
Their projectiles are directed to the target by laser with a hit-safeness of only a few meters.
The special bulkheads of 25 mm caliber designed for this weapon and containing high-explosive explosives work practically like small grenades.
The bulkheads can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point on their ballistics route.
That means you can use it against an enemy hiding behind a barrier - a wall or in a protective tomb.
It is not usually protected from above, so it can easily be left out of combat by the murder of the steel fragmenter from above.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new defence is the first infantry weapon that makes use of "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier basically goes like this: he points to the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, then he wins an exact point of view, after which he corrects the rise angle, then he just needs to pull it off.
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you are depressed, the weapon is called up and shoots the gun at the distance of 543 meters plus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs reduced
The Fujitsu Group leaves its settlement in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will be placed in the Astro Park from the previous office building at the Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg.
The Japanese group Fujitsu leaves its settlement in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported on the computer and its maintenance industry crisis on Wednesday, 400 women and men will be placed in the Astro Park, a large office complex at the Lyoner Straße, in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad, in July next year.
A speaker from Fujitsu explained that, in the medium term, there should still be 100 more jobs in the group that have been distributed to the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive, and the large offices in the Astro Park are better opposed by the employees' way of working.
In Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was also just tenants.
Managing Director Bernd Wagner said, "with Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The recent transfer of an important company within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointments to the losers yesterday.
Frankfurter Economics Senator Markus Frank (CDU) said that a "Global Player" was once again won.
That was a "great locality."
Fujitsu passes to the city, the settlement is an important impulse for the Lower Rad.
The Bad Homburger Mayor Michael Korwisi (Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
"We have of course offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at the Marienbader Square.
Finally, economic reasons would have given rise to the shock.
Now it is to prevent a long gap in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owners and owners of the building show themselves cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu so far at the courthouse and the neighboring "Small Vertical" belonged to the other buildings at the Marienbader Square ten years ago to the most controversial construction projects in Kurstadt.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, between the railway station and the town hall, a new city entrance was created, which provided both for the massive construction of the areas used as a parking lot and the height of the buildings for criticism.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel sales systems, Start Amadeus, and then the computer manufacturer Fujitsu connected to Siemens.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Group, together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund, and sold a year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consuls resident in Tokyo are the third largest IT providers in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The settlement in the Rhein-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, much more employees include Fujitsu, however, in Munich.
From Bad Homburg the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries in this place are to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, the Astro Park 7000 square meters were rented in the office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its star base - the central association has its seat, among other things, in the electrical and electronic industry.
Amazon Blocked Server - Threats to Assange
Wikileaks is becoming increasingly stressed.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Perhaps there is political pressure after the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange is reported to be standing in England.
The Wikileaks revelation platform is increasingly under attack in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called in other countries and companies to the Boycott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's catch list, is expected to stop after a newspaper report in Britain.
"Vikileaks forced by Amazon server."
"Free speech in the country of the free", the disclosure activists announced via short notice service Twitter on Wednesday (place time).
The Amazon Internet company had recently banned Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had withdrew from the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in the publication of the secret diplomatic presentations in order to manage the high numbers of access to the documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks went on to say: "Excellent - our dollars will now be spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such problems with freedom of speech, "they stopped selling books".
Amazon has stopped using its server via Wikileaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman had employed research, the TV broadcaster CNN reported on the Liebermans office.
The president of the Senate Committee on Homeland Protection had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reports the British "Guardian".
"I wish Amazon had taken this measure earlier in view of previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Lieberman therefore called on the platform to ban the use of servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileak's illegal, unbelievable and reckless action puts our national security at risk and our lives around the globe," said a statement by the partial senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in his efforts to distribute stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is sought by the authorities in Sweden for suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's catch list.
After a report from the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian in the United Kingdom, the exact place is Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always referred to the investigations in Sweden as an entry of his opponent.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London, there were threats.
"There was even a call after a murder of Julian Assange."
Therefore, Assange rightly feared for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore remain hidden.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be charged and ordered for treason.
In Canada, a advisor to government chief Stephen Harper - apparently ironic - said that assanging should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange there was an exchange of hits.
The speaker of American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "Laughter and absurd", that Assange had demanded the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently announced espionage appointments to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The U.S. government now includes the protection of its databases in the field of testing.
As a special agent, the vice-director of the Centre for Anti-Terror Action, Russell Travers, was appointed, the White House informed him.
Travers is responsible for developing "the necessary structural reforms" that have become necessary after the disclosure of the message reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to examine ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced that it should ensure the safety of dissidents and activists through the publication of Wikileaks.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said external speaker Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" at Bologna, iron dispensers are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest tour and visitors from all over the world.
Where does the whole ice actually come from?
From the Gelatio and the Gelatio.
The gelatier, in German, somewhat old-fashioned of the ice-cream, presents the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-cream.
The gelataio takes the ice cream out of the fridge with a spoon, spreads it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know that, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to know more about ice, it does not come to the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University has set up the manufacturer of ice-creams in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines can be repaired all over Italy's high ideals.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest tour and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also multi-day special courses around chocolate and practice in the house itself.
Some dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, while others simply wander on the smooth ice of their vague quests.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow-food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to take advantage of some of her own in a nervous job after years.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an iceberg in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Galtiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Deciding is not only good taste, but also silky greed and good consistency.
Luciano, in his training, also forgets the hinting of the national and even of the southern superstructure: "Italian Gelato is just the best - and then there is still a lot of romance."
The first step to manufacture seems quite simple.
Luciano picks the basic ingredients of milk, soap, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything up to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools down to four degrees.
Then he turns up on the machine, and comes out a pasteurised white bass cream, the basis for all dairy varieties.
Immediately, the teacher will be confused with questions: Can you produce ice cream only with natural substances without stabiliser?
How can you let your own experimental appetite run free?
Luciano warns to be led by the spirit of time into the Irish.
Those who speak of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers, however - mostly a natural product, such as guarkernmel from the guarbohne.
Of course, you can make ice without a stabilizer, only then it must be sold within a day, otherwise it will fall together, and the customer bites on loud ice pellets.
Certain variations in the base mass are allowed.
It's going to be more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste of ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or in the sweetness of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn to dozens of flavoured additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either at the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even at the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes with eggs to yellow cream and with cocoa powder on the basis of all possible chocolate deposits.
Now the participants are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano allows each to produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mokka and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavourings or other natural additives.
In the same experiment, the fruit varieties will be subject to the same test.
More flavourings, more fruit powder - tasteful this is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice doesn't taste any more nudity if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice represents the working group, which uses more fruit, less water and slightly less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mix brings the taste of a gelato right out, says Luciano.
Ice production is a computational task: If Pforsich powder is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content must be reduced in the basic recipe.
An extraportion sugar is necessary for lemons.
Luciano draws up a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winners measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Luckily, tables make computers easier.
Ice making doesn't require as much physical use as before.
Not only does the machine help the automatic production of the base mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mix is hit creamy at the same time and cooled at minus temperatures.
All automation to the contrary does not remain small pans.
The Brazilian Gustavo folds himself and his students from above to below with fruit pears, when the superdimensional Stabmixer takes over control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time until something like this happens."
Checks in selection
The European Food Authority is under the influence of the replanting industry.
This proposal is now formulated by the Expert Group Test Biotech, which is understood as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have well documented it," said Testbiotech Chief Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the EFSA Expert Group for Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have been under contract for years at the Ilsi Lobbyist Association.
It is paid by groups such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has significantly cooperated with the EFSA testing rules for replanting plants and thus stood in a clear conflict of interest, criticised Then.
The EFSA regulations are essentially equivalent to the position papers of the Ilsi and thus bear the handwriting of the industry, which is to be controlled by the Italian Parma by the authority.
It was already the second time that Test Biotech advocated a conflict of interest.
Thus, a high-ranking Efsa manager was recently without any notice or transitional time to the Swiss Farm Group Syngenta - and thus changed the pages.
The German medium-sized radio (MDR) had recently revealed personal links between the EU's controlling authority and industry lobby, as well as with EU Parliamentarians.
The EFSA cannot recognise any conflicts of interest.
All serious data, including those of industry, should be taken back as long as they are of high professional quality, it is said in an opinion.
The experts who work for EFSA do not require that they have no contact with industry.
But they had to reveal it.
Kuiper organizes his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This is itself a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - including the risk assessment of biotechnology without lobbying.
In the case, independent experts such as Then criticise that genetically modified plants are currently allowed without any animal feeding test and the reaction of plants to environmental influences will not be tested.
"We want to know what makes genetically modified maize on the land," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the entire replant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how can you find them?" says Then.
That's what Angelika Hilbeck looks like.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
The industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in this area, as in the United States.
There are therefore hardly any researchers who have not been involved with groups.
Critical studies for companies would generally not be published.
"The industry controls security research," claims Hilbeck.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell has also taken care of a total of about 400 kilos.
On the Monday evening he stood in front of Stuttgart Train Station, the tube on the back.
It was Demo.
It's cutting.
The story is known: In September the Baggers were excited and had begun to break off a large piece of the northern bird.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-thousand-thick landing of the railway station.
When it came to the buildingtop, most of the bird was in drums.
Broken in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Craigsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft rough stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfieldern, 43 years old.
He saved himself a few of the fractures.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He whispers: "A cheaper and poorer stone, simple and earthy."
When he gave it up, he smoked the cigarette qualm.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with the fractures yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stone leads to a forest near Tübingen on a former munitions depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his stone kingdom.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He's bought all of them that hit him when he was abrissed in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame, they would be framed to shoot or disappear in the depot," he says in his office, a wooden house once a cottage.
He was harassed and threatened, he tells when in September he was in the newspapers that he bought the rest of the northern wing from the drug dealer.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents, for a long time.
And he told them that he couldn't do anything for the Abriss now.
And if it happens again, then it's the wisest thing to do if the stones were to be used again.
Approximately 200 S-21 competitors then took one of the 80-kilo heavy frames, a piece price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a thought, some, but also in the hope of restoring it.
500 tons had bought rounds, 25 large truck loads.
About half is still in the forest, the rest is sold for a long time.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, house builder.
From everywhere they had come and had dragged away what the trunk and trailers could carry.
The Stuttgart stone of the attack has long been transformed into "mature" or into limits of herbs.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"It wouldn't be the political component."
He rises in his parking lot, making a tour through his 20 hectares a great empire.
Jura has studied and broken down, later biology, then he's interested in computers and has finally become a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
40000 tons of stone stored it.
From all over Germany he collects his treasures.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the Republic.
It's braked.
In the snow there are artificially kept sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, it's hot.
"My lovestone."
It's going up the road through the forest.
It shows on a hill: red sandstone, earlier part of Karlsruhe Railway Station.
Keep going.
"Sweet Travertin."
On one occasion, the quads belonged to the Court of Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, red granite from the Dom Sankt Blasien, tuff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When the rings think about how the stones were cut by hand and moved with simple bottles and ovaries, he will be very frightened.
"It'd be a scandal if you were going to do something like that."
He didn't become rich, he didn't even have a stone.
But 14 people are working today, and also in the forest stone metze, a sculptor, a hamster, a glass-blazer and a garden builder.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the restorist.
He'll have to go to Cologne soon.
There are also rocks to save.
Talent struggle for high potentials
It's reigning andrang at the buffet.
16 Students strive for salmon, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Autobauer Volkswagen have invited the machine building and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they will be able to learn about the car of the future with VW developers – and in addition to the cars.
In the battle around the smartest heads, many companies now go to the nearby fight and, like VW, engage in cooperation with universities.
Your mission: The most successful graduates will be recruiting in the hearing rooms as early as possible before they come to the labour market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities do not issue opinions on the performances of their students, they try to highlight the exceptional talents in practical projects and join in.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car group throws around the talents.
A young lady from the staff department distributes ballwriters, rubber rings and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young people about practical programmes and students' jobs and shows them ways in the groups.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig manages the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students come into contact with industry and gather experiences."
"VW can get to know students at the same time, look closer to interesting candidates and think about who comes in question as an employee."
Such cooperation, such as Selle, is not unusual.
Newly said that the students would be so offensive.
"Sometimes the focus was on the professional project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably get even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large range of applicants.
In particular, they need to compete and especially to encourage highly qualified workers.
In particular, graduates from engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineers remained unaccompanied in October.
And the so-called engineering accident is going to get even bigger, according to VDI forecasts.
For the business audit and consulting company KPMG, Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt.
He organizes extensive recruitment events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern cutting hunt where participants must find their way through GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the United States next year.
In addition, participants can view KPMG files and get to know the company.
Anyone who can decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the Créme de la Créme of the many applicants flies to the United States.
At the Hauen and Stichen around the High Potentials at the Universities, the shields are increasing according to Dykta.
"We want to get out of the way with the race."
"Only a simple sailing session was too small for us."
For talent hunters, Dykta seems to be billing.
"We have to date contact with all participants of a similar action in the past year."
"Some are just ahead of their conclusion and want to apply to us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct booming at the campus, mainly small and medium-sized enterprises also go to the Pirsch in a classic way.
"We're trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"A bit on the intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, staff leader at the Solar Technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner Company employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stube knows about the growing problem.
Currently, 35 sites are published on the company website.
"It's just very difficult to occupy vacant positions."
"It costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld co-operates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors indicate that we can practice or write his degree."
expensive advertising activities are not mentioned in the solar specialists.
For this, the company tries to recruit with other advantages for itself: Personal atmosphere, flat hierarchy and light communication.
"It can't often offer a large group," says staff leader Stübe.
Money no longer plays the main role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good climbing opportunities are other crucial factors.
In a study of the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld presented the 55th place among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute is creating an annual best list of German employers.
It asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and work environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
Staff leader Tube is also expected to place additional points with job seekers.
"I think that applicants especially look at external evaluations about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients on more authenticity.
And that means, according to the warrior, primarily internal measures.
"The best way to be attractive as an employer is through their own employees," he says.
In the industry jargon, the internal employer branding, i.e. employer branding, is within its own staff.
"Happy employees are the best ambassadors."
If his people were treated well and identified with the company, they would be sold by friends and acquaintances for their employers.
"It's like a gang game," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
Before the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drilling in the coming years.
A corresponding ban has been passed by the government in Washington - thus finalizing its earlier plans.
New drillings are also being prevented before the Atlantic coast.
This was shared by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban to be applied for at least the next five years is the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the accident, which cost eleven workers their lives and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signaled on the pressure of the opposition and industry to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The sponsors want to reduce the dependence of the US on oil supplies abroad.
Those who bear the responsibility for the devastating oil shortage in the Gulf have not been fully understood to this day.
The British energy group BP, which is faced with billions of demands, is in the centre of the criticism.
A committee of inquiry on behalf of Obama will present its results during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drill stop hung after the explosion.
Following this, various oil groups immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter safety regulations, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a recent disaster.
At present, the competent control authority, which has been set up in response to numerous corruptions, is fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama announced that it would close lucrative tax gaps for the oil and gas groups.
The industry now publicly warns that the amount of aid in the Gulf would be significantly lower by a more stringent regulation than before.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," says the result of a current industry survey by the BDO consulting firm - even before the drill ban of Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with the regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice - loading of growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the tank: billions of litres of crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooks.
Celestine Akpobari thinks it's good.
"Don't worry," the eco-activist calms the journalists: "You'll still get enough oil slam in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has been trying to light up a boy in the water to his chest with the veils surrounding him: in the rainbow-coloured water glass, the scene seems almost beautiful.
That under the surface of brown oak forests is not visible.
Earlier she had collected yarns here, says Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo-Jetti River.
In the meantime, this brings running water to a complete end.
Five years ago, they were exodus from a nested pipeline of crude oil in the vast wet area.
Fisher from the nearby town of Bodo now has to mine six hours to reach fishy waters: the Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger delta is considered one of the worst devastated regions in the world.
On the way through the mangrove storms that flow through rivers, the whole extent of worship will be seen.
Instead of light water, the motorboat smells brown brühe, who dives his hand into the water, pulls out the oil fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees are like black lactating stalks from the ground, sad to let individual palm trees hang their tails.
Bird fever, as they are otherwise usual in wet areas, is sought for forgiveness: As soon as the outer border hovers, the former paradise, like a reservoir, expands to a state of ease.
"What happens here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari window: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is in place.
The settlement area of Ogoni has been a battle field for decades: here the first explorers from Europe were forced to enter more than 60 years ago, here organized in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa of the first resistance, here the Shell Group had to set up its production because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Today, the company is still denied the return to Ogoniland: while from the whole region of the delta from the three-fold size of Switzerland with more than 5000 drilling sources and 7,000 kilometers pipelines are pumped daily more than two million layers of black gold, the oil fields broke in Ogoniland, too unstable the group is the situation.
All a couple of hundreds of meters reach stealthy places like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christe Trees" are called the heads of holes too affectionate.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroding to the mark.
Always break such a drill head apart, means Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
More than two billion litres have been flown into the delta's ecosystem in 50 years, according to expert estimates: year by year, the amount of oil, as it was forced into the sea 21 years before Alaska - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Those who are responsible for the continued eco-guay will be challenged.
While the Shell Group Sabotatage and the organized oil dust is responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see heavy drilling heads and leak pipelines as the main cause.
Shell has significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than elsewhere in the world, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner presented to the group in 2008: "only the rate of defects on the lines is "a multiple higher than elsewhere".
At a place that looks like a deserted, oily workshop under the free sky, emerge from the mangrove shapes: they are split and crushed to the neck.
Under one of the many fibers that are partly connected with tubes, partially dissipated on the ground, a fire flexes: an illegal small refinery.
In the façade, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the catch floor, later drop field at the end of the line Kerosin and finally diesel out.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel a 300 litres daily: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - around 22 dollars.
The Delta residents use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The slightly low diesel price of almost 40 euro cents per litre can still be provided by illegal cooks: because their raw material will be returned to them.
It comes from "bunkers", which captures the pipeline across Ogoniland: This way, experts throughout Niger lose at least 16 million litres of crude oil per day.
However, only a small part of the provisional intermediate raw material is illegally distributed: the lion's share of organised criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military, are to be filled with tankers and smelt them on the world market.
The debate, whether the environmental disaster is due to the revolutions of the population or to the salmon production method, is held by the activist Akpobari for purely academic reasons.
"If oil companies were not considered to be intruders and if they had not destroyed the fish's life base so thoroughly, there was no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, the Ogoni ratio has been destroyed, especially to Shell, so that only a withdrawal of the group could be investigated: "Maybe other nationalities like the Chinese are better off."
Michael's gonna be nervous.
"The greatest time you're missing," says the muscle-oiler.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil processors are acquired from the special unit of the fighting forces, they are not threatened with imprisonment, but perhaps a painful smear.
The soldiers from the north of the country, like all Nigerians, want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn joke has brought our country in every respect to the dog," Akpobari says.
Discover dangerous baufehler in A380-drives
The A380 obviously has a major security problem.
Researchers have discovered in the investigation of a non-resident machine a possible bauffer that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The Qantas Fly will now defeat the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of Qantas-Airbus were apparently much more fortunate at the beginning of November than they have been.The Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in the engines of some A380 machines in its investigations - and now warns of a possible boomer.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil pipeline connection, it could create fatigue and leaks, as stated in an opinion of the ATSB authority published on Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure".
Affected were engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus, which had to be notlanded on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline has now launched legal steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
It was founded in Sydney by an Australian Federal Court of Justice, which provided him with further legal measures against the company.
Qantas-Chief Alan Joyce said his airline would claim compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
At the fire of the engine parts had dissolved and damaged the wear surfaces.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire the cause of the damage.
In the meantime, up to 40 drivers must now be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that further safety tests should be carried out on the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesperson Martin Dolan.
The security problem has been considered important enough to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of its eleven A380 on the ground.
The Lufthansa replaced the engine with an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-seat flyer is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Land-wide snow triggers traffic
Germany all in white: Over the night snow is almost all over the country.
On many streets chaos, trains and flights fall off.
At least three people died in car accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: At icy temperatures, almost the entire Republic is joined at night on Thursday - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and the east there are partly 15 centimeters thick snow cover.
On several highways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
At the A7 at Flensburg, the winter service was in permanent service, but was not finished with the ever-changing snow.
In addition, severe torments were heaped over the eastern coast.
The Federal Office for Sea Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) is waiting at the eastern coast of Schleswig-Holsteins from the morning to storm flows with a water stand of 1.2 meters above normal.
In Sachsen, snow travel on the motorways and the federal highways led to major problems.
According to the weather-centred Meteomedia, this was why the alarm level was violet - the highest level at all.
In part, 30 centimeters of snow, fresh and strong wind provided for travel.
There were several trucks and cars in the night.
In Sachsen-Anhalt, the police also reported major road disturbances.
On the A2, snow and wind led to steady traffic and storm.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls.
According to German Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Northern Bavaria.
Snow on the slopes, crushed trees on the rails or destroyed bridges and softs are the main problems.
In Saxony, the traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thüringian Saalfeld, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided by firefighters and rescue helpers with wool blankets, food and drink in the train.
Snowwinds fed over the streets.
On large German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous airports.
According to a speaker in Munich, some cancellations have already been reported.
In Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights have already been cancelled, according to a French speaker.
The winter service is in use.
Although only a few beached passengers are at the airport, they still have nearly 400 beds.
On many roads, there were accidents already on Wednesday.
In the evening, an Lkw professional came to life on a train on a train crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to snow-covered roads: here too a truck was recorded on a train crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore blocked until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had crossed the smooth road with her car at Ashchenburg.
However, the meteorologists have good news: Even though the snow will still be loose and powdery, it will cause light evils to rise.
But the wind will slow down.
Only the Baltic Sea is searched by fast and storming winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its trademark: According to a newspaper report, the Moneyhouse is looking for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could bring the property.
The German Bank has just made its group seat beautiful: The twin towers in Frankfurt have been modernised; the banks have now been allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group wants to recover the costs of renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" is calling on a speaker.
Reasons for the planned sale were not called by the speaker.
"We always check whether it is more meaningful to own or sell properties and then rent back," he said.
Germany's largest credit institution thus returns to its company office after a short time.
The Bank had only taken over the double towers for 272 million euros from the investors of a home fund in mid-2007 and then refurbished heavily.
The energy conversion went down to about 200 million euros.
A sale would probably make the bank a lot of money.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers currently renamed "greenowers" according to the newspaper to some 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are resold to a bank-owned fund or to an independent investor, the speaker said that the building is still open.
Thousands of mourning for a dead friend
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the hidden mountains, which have been declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
Still, the bodies could not be secured because the safety situation in the accident box is still precarious.
Almost two weeks ago it came to a severe explosion in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 mountain workers between the ages of 17 and 62 were displaced under days.
A probe had been left in the accident box, but no trace of survivors had been discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue forces could be lifted for safety reasons.
After the second severe detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no longer any chance of survival for the party.
The bodies could not be secured so far.
Now the relatives and friends remembered with a memorial to the dead.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered on the New Zealand South Island in the glowing sunlight in Greymouth.
For two minutes, they swung.
In honor of the scattered mountains there were 29 tables on which were seen of helmets, lamps and the names of the palate.
Pictures and personal items, including clothes and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags were half-mast.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth", New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said to the participants of the commemoration.
"But they never came home."
He could not finish with the death of his son, until he had seen his body, Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the grave.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemoration.
At the first explosion on 19 November, British and South African mountains were also exposed.
Rescue workers began to wipe out a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gas is forced, it will start to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mines, police president Gary Knowles said to journalists.
To hell, warrior!
Does Splater fit the art cinema?
The director of Nicolas Winding Refn is re-launching old genre boundaries with his "Wallalla Rising" rival Epos.
What audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought about when he turned Wallalla Rising?
A prisoner Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is free from his tormentors and is killing his opponents with almost superhuman forces - sounds ideal for young male spectators looking for blood action, just because our hero likes to serve angry killing methods and his enemies are already blowing the dust out of the living body when he has bad pay.
On the other hand, Ineye, as it is actually called, does not say the whole film about a word, and also the other figures can be drawn at least one or two sentences or a few quail death cries.
Otherwise, the beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which the Viking world offers about a thousand years ago, will be swayed.
Ideal for adults with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera travel.
Nice, if a movie has several target groups, it only hurts if they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has since his wild and controlled drug trilogy "pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he refuses to make his works more humorous to the mainstream or to make something less brutal to the arthouse accessible.
Most art kino friends should be scared of the surrounding brain mass and the intestines.
The action fans will die for a long time at the latest when, for free interpretable reasons, they break up with a troops of violent Christian missionaries by ship to Jerusalem and establish an eternity in flute and nebula before the team appears to arrive in America and continues to float there.
No wonder that "Wallala Rising" in Germany did not find a cinema rental and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is particularly sad because of the magnificent images, but also because behind the pretentious to bloodthirsty facade, a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a tight action, it's all atmosphere, a film-like fever dream.
And there's no way out of it for the viewer.
Refn hardly likes him a moment of relaxation and ties him with his icy pictures and the window trance-like soundtrack quite slowly to the throat, but especially with the unfathomable hate that confronts him from the heart of the figures.
Only a small blonde boy, who stands by his eyes faithfully, is kept as innocent as all others are driven by anger.
Most of the simple hero whose motive is never explained, but who will ever become a warrior from Hell for enemies and temporary allies, perhaps a messenger of the devil himself.
It means destruction, but perhaps only for those who have been destroyed without it.
Wallhalla Rising is a gruesome film that you can hate and admire, for trouble, excitement and stalwarts.
An experience.
Resolved land works
The IAEA Atomic Energy Authority has new guidance on a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country, however, refuses to take a position on this - it is not even able to control it.
On Wednesday 5th to 6th September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I combat aircraft attacked a mysterious, wave-shaped building in Syria.
It is on the shore of the Euphrates; the next largest city, 30 kilometres away, is Dair ash-saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built with the help of North Korea in the quader is hidden in a valley that runs from the current.
According to a letter from the CIA Foreign Secret Service of late April 2008, the nearby El Kibar reactor would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons were built.
For other purposes, however, the technology is hardly moving from the five-digits.
The CIA conducted a video presentation with uncharted satellite images.
By computer animation, it blended into which components of the reactor were to have been before the destruction, which is a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Atomic Center Yongbyon.
She also presented photos showing the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor was just before the launch, but it had not yet been used with fuel.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, it's hardly known more than at the time, yes, the puzzles got bigger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite certain that Syria had built a reactor in el-Kibar, but hardly noticed that there was "an active nuclear programme" in the country.
Some secret officials in Europe prefer to be careful and speak only of a "probably reactor", even if they hold the CIA presentation for "plausible".
You're missing hard evidence, just like the IAEA.
Asked how certain he was to have a reactor ahead of him, a high UN diplomat in the summer answered only Lapidar, which the IAEA has "sufficient material to ask questions".
The protection of the alleged "unutilized military building" made the acidity aside and planned the site thoroughly.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team was found under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in el-kibar traces of Uran, which was produced by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received from a Member State satellite images of commercial suppliers from the time immediately after the attack which should be more pronounced than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not to be obtained on the market because the unknown customer - perhaps Israel - has bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always appreciated never operating a secret nuclear program or building a reactor.
The uranium is derived from the Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
However, this proved unlikely to be the case for the IAEA after analysis of the particles.
Since then Damascus has refused to discuss this - just as about satellite images.
It also rejects the controllers a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the ruins of the destroyed building.
But Israel also bows to iron.
"We will never comment on this," recently confirmed Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position at the time of the attack.
As a result, the investigation of the case has been ineffective since June 2008 and "becomes increasingly a serious credibility issue for the Authority", as a high Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - finally, a serious breach of the nuclear-weapon treaty in the area over which the IAEA is awaiting.
As a key to progress in the disclosure, the IAEA clearly sees three other institutions that are to be "in functional connection" with the required reactor - and otherwise exist.
In doing so, the inspectors have not yet revealed which facilities they are or what function they have or what they may appear suspiciously.
According to information from the South German newspaper, they are referred to as Marj as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah internally at the IAEA, and are derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these sites and discovered a building complex on satellite images at Masyaf, where it is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or immediately next to a military base - precisely with this reason, Syria of the IAEA rejects access to the three places.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will be sent from the United States to launch military installations.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities by a tip from the U.S. intelligence services.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that material was transported between the three places and the frame at the Euphrates.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the installations could be "in connection with fuel production".
However, there is "no indication of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes needed to build nuclear weapons.
Although the type of reactor is operated with uranium, it is not enriched.
But where the uranium would have come from and where later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated, there are at least plausible suspicions about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether drums that could raise valuable traces could be stored in three places.
As the hundreds of trucks had disappeared from the ground, no one wanted information about where the protection was left.
The saltmine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometres from El Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria has examined on its suitability for radioactive waste in 1998, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently contacted the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, recordings from the Orbit show that Syria went ahead in the three suspected locations and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but it has hardly contributed to eliminating suspicion.
Furthermore, in diplomatic circles, the IAEA has used several months to develop a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows the importance of inspectors.
Indess, Damascus also proposed this proposal.
If Western diplomats in Vienna were weakened a year ago, the reactor was destroyed, so the matter has not been very urgent, for example US ambassador Glyn Davies has been carrying out so-called special inspections in the game for a few months, one of the strongest means the Vienna nuclear authority has to carry out.
IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but he is still reluctant.
There is a high risk in this way: For one thing, there is a need for a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and some of the 35 countries represented there are all other than caves on an escalation.
To others, how can a diplomat think, "What if they don't find anything at all?"
Love in Times of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her nameless driver's seat in the summer, there's been a lot of trouble.
She wrote her own book, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Much more you don't know about it - but that's enough for trouble.
The rumor, the woman, a Muslim, is in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, after which some of the rotating days planned in Sarajevo were transferred to Hungary in a short time.
Meanwhile, the film is turned down in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the organization of female war victims wrote about the UN Refugee Relief Agency UNHCR in Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie himself is the ambassador of the UN Refugee Relief Agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary a week ago, but they refused.
The meeting had to take place in Bosnia, as Hasecic said.
Love stories in rape camps did not exist, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims betrayed her enough about the book.
Her organization has recommended that the UN refugee relief team leave Jolie as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got her to read the spinbook, has granted a rotational licence for Sarajevo after a while - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author himself admires that she does not pursue political intentions with her film, has worked hard in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, the content remains vague.
This is how a second synopsis of the film takes place in the network, which then sounds quite different: the lovers knew of it before the outbreak of war and met again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is dragged into a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds a lot different than the variant "violence victims fall into torture."
That Jolies film actually starts before the war - so much is safe.
The pressure on them, as Jolie says, is "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now you can only afford the hackers of Hollywood peace: By putting the spinbook, like so many before, illegally into the net.
Nothing like this.
This evening, it is finally again running right around for the Irish.
No sign of trouble.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States too much.
The fans gloat before joy in dazzling loud music, they prowl with their feet.
The Bailey pub is in the south Cork because players throw and meet table tennis balls over a three-dimensional distance in beer beers.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, there is 500 Euro victory prize plus tickets to Las Vegas for the Bierpong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this shrill drinking game and the withholding computer player does not really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old is trying to amuse himself to get away from the boring question, what the future will bring.
On his plan there is no play in Las Vegas, he will lead application talks in New Zealand in January.
"I have a hunch of feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far from home and I still don't have a job there."
Anyway: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland - "she had ruck, sucked her wish job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor perspectives at home, two of the three Tanners have already sought their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the dancers, it looks on the island in many families.
100 000 Irish will probably leave the country in the near future, experts from the ESRI Institute of Economic and Social Research in Dublin say.
By 2015 they will even count with 200,000 immigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a severe loss.
If the forecasts are preserved, it is similar to that of those under Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of recovery, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, Tristesse is again expanding.
The economic crisis in particular prevents the young, well-trained Irish, for which it has only been uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was used, money was in the flood.
In the meantime, three out of ten women and men are under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times there are also letters from young emigrants who complain: "Everything goes down the river in Ireland."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - but who can go away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one makes the light out."
Jura-Student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a dark future rise because the government only operates eyewash and gives young people no hope for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says 20-year-olds.
She observes how her fellows hang from an unpaid practice to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, is to have to go abroad in four years itself.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to raise the issue positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers a round-the-clock service on the topic of working abroad.
"For beginners, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career leader," says the manager.
On his website are photos surfing in Australia and snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a gale service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something somewhere, Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year.
Because there was nothing more to be done for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they just pull up a fashion house.
In January it will continue to go to Hannover or Berlin, for the next project.
His home now sees O'Donovan only rarely, because he makes extra layers to pay off the credit for his house at home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says, when for a long time he goes over the threshold of his house for the first time.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am as good as ever."
He laughs a bit and goes through cool rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with well-maintained courtyards, in the entrance parks large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent credit.
"There were crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid it could go wrong with the credit?
O'Donovan spends a while, throws hot tea and says, "I don't have any children to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from New."
The construction engineer does not like the whirring that he is hearing at the moment.
"No one has to be hungry - our situation is not as dramatic as it was on the island in the past," he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst that can happen - perhaps it makes us feel like Irish."
He laughs and then tells of his father, who went to England in the last great economic crisis.
"After seven years he was there again and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Let the future open and just look at how it goes with life elsewhere.
A few years' work in London has already been behind him, and why shouldn't it also run well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
There is one thing that still bothers him in these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid it might look like a life-saving party.
"Just don't get too many emotions," he says and drinks a lot of his beer.
"Well, that sounds scary."
"We'd rather call it a road party, rather loose, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The Democratic Routine
The movement of democracy in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
These results included the Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly evident in this year's survey of September and October.
First the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased significantly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of democratic advocates rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong break-in last year, such a trend is to be recognised.
However, only half of the people in Mexico and Brazil, the richest countries of the region, are convinced that the regional average is lower (see Figure 2).
Some 44% of respondents said that they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, which is as much as in the past year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of the last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% or 24%).
A decade ago Latin America's economic crisis undermined the efforts of more democracy.
This also happened during the global economic crisis, perhaps because the countries of Latin America have only experienced a short phase of recession and have recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were captured by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America increased only slightly and 32% fell again this year.)
But from country to country there are strong differences in mood (see Figure 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the distinguished president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a widely thought of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more tangible and increased violence, this is less the case.
For the second time since the beginning of the survey, many people in Latin America have seen a greater problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see Figure 5).
About 31% say that either they or a family member have been victims of a crime in the last year. However, compared to 38% in the last year, the values have decreased and thus reach the lowest level since 1995.
The increasing economic performance is reflected in stronger support for the private and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents over the region indicated that the private sector is indispensable for development, 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can make progress in its country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left president, Hugo Chávez, has published many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year) Brazil has the highest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
On the other hand, respondents in Mexico and most countries in Central America see the most influential country in the United States, taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
A Select Tray
No one expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on November 28.
But the facts far outweighed the fears of the electorate who sought help from the oppressed country.
Filled polling hours, multiple votes cast, ballots in the Rhinestone, destroyed lobbying and intimidation were only part of the problems.
Wahlokale opened with a long delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the earthquake in January, fought around looking for a choice.
Some finally gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including a number of courageous top leaders, demanded the abolition of the election results on the basis of alleged fraud.
There were partial violent protests throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the leader of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "as pretty good in many interests".
According to a careful statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community "make these irregularities as serious as they may be, the process is not necessarily invalid".
In other words, the show goes on.
The election authority, which is supposed to be bound by the unpopular separatist president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected elections are scheduled for January.
There's still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and the former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial complaint of invalidity.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no agreement with the voters, explains the election authority to win the election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the victims of earthquakes still live in tents, a little electoral involvement was feared.
On the election day, many Haitians were prevented by the lack of organization in the vote.
Shortly before the election started, about 250,000 demonstrations needed for the election were not yet distributed.
There's a lot on the game.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks following your husband's sudden death, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that has driven her popularity rate by 20 points up to over 50%. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, if you help this to a re-election next year, it depends whether the apparently mourning Cristina Fernández is a compromiser than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
The signs for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also led economic policy after his wife's election, often presented budget plans that did not fully take into account tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the President-in-Office to issue extra incomes according to his own thoughts.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in the Congress last year.
But the opposition was divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further defeats.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (where one parliamentarian fell in the face of another and others visited the government of the petition) the Congress was unable to adopt the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss it," said the President.
The 2010 budget is also valid for the next year, which gives the President an even more opportunity to spend money on his own merits.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
For example, the official inflation rate is 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage requirements of trade unions - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003, when Argentina was protected by economic crises, explained growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, rather than inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, blackmailed the private sector, and refined the National Institute for Statistics and Population Indication, which then pleased official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández take a slower course now?
She called the private economy and the trade union leaders for talks.
And according to official statements, wage increases will be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undermined growth by a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps Cristina Fernández would like to return financially to the rest of the world for this reason.
At the beginning of this year, the government entered into an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country's earlier debt in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to insist on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The churches had always rejected a review by the IMF, as elsewhere usual.
But last month, Minister of Economic Affairs Amado Boudou announced that the fund would provide "technical support" for the creation of a new national consumer price index. It seems that this would be the first step towards the purification of the INDIC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even after the end of her term of office without the support of her husband.
If so, she needs the support of the middle layer, which has most of it from the church.
If the Argentinians return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of the sympathy they received will be canceled.
If she wants to win another choice, she has to decide whether to silence and silence many political decisions of her husband.
Weakapplaus for China
Taiwan voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan hold from his great brother beyond the seashore?
On 27 November more than 7.5 million electors, which are 70% of all electors, were elected to elect mayors and city halls in the five districts of the city. This is assessed as a wide-ranging evaluation by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the construction of railway business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma itself is a symbol of relations to the mainland. Her policy has changed the relationship to the Chinese country for the first time since 1949.
Ma has passed the test, but just barely.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) is the fifth of the five mayors, she did not receive a majority.
Instead, the Democratic Party for Progress (DPP), which supports greater independence in Taiwan, received almost 50% of the votes that KMT received 45%.
In the case of a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even joined the KMT in the streets.
During the election it came to the usual events in Taiwan, such as cargo convoys with cranes, flag-swift masseuses and only particularly dressed dancers.
There was even the mandatory mysterious attempted murder.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and the honorary president of the KMT held a speech on a KMT candidate on the night before the election,
When a man shot him in the face from the crowd, he was wounded, and a man of the constant lookout was killed.
Bizart's point of view is not clear whether the shooter killed the line or wanted to argue with the candidate.
Regardless of this, the attack has, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, affected the election and turned the DPP into a bad light, which the KMT has protected more voices.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Notably, relations with the mainland have not been thematicized.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to give priority to its relations with the government in Beijing.
However, this time also avoids the DPP, the anti-Chinese feelings to be much scarred.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
But he would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese support their Chinese policies.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of withdrawing Taiwan with economic incentives into the Community.
China immediately sent a distributor to Taipei to prepare a summit meeting for investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly also wants political integration, but the most important.
It therefore prefers to wait until the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now come up again.
Two years ago she was severely weakened: the former leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was very much in favour of absolute independence.
But under Tais Regent, a new generation of decent politicians developed, and the DPP is fighting for the voices of professionals and young people.
Tsai, as a presidential candidate for the DPP, found great agreement, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Your party is now doing everything to show that it is also able to build close relationships with Beijing.
Tsai plans an idea as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this presupposes unprejudiced discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that its party offers a "confidential alternative" to mass faster approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell he explained that the DPP's candidates would have been better able to exist on Taiwan's independence.
He even asked Pragmaticer Su to refuse the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP makes it difficult to choose its potential candidates.
The KMT will have to undertake its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead their election without it.
The main reasons for his infidelity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing gap between the poor and the rich.
According to a KMT speaker, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan only supports a limited recovery.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no return anymore".
Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer category of the year
If you come to a president's request, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to attend the ceremony on the occasion of the 2009 Nobel Prize Award. Now the 26-year-old jazz coach and singer was nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination appears a little unusual. However, it complies with the Grammy rules that an artist may have issued at least three albums before the album was released, with which he was known in the general public.
Your ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with its impressive voice and a good sense of pop, fun and Latin music, Spalding can be compared quietly with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz interpreter in this category of nominating spaldings next.
In addition, the album "History" by Vijay Iyer Trios was nominated for instrument albums in the category. This critic's favorite was a huge success.
Among Iyer's competitors are "Moody 4B" by experienced Saxophoneist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardman John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a thieves' favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of Contemporary Jazz, where the other albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber can be found.
The Secret Society of Wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue has received well-deserved attention in the category of Great Group. He thus acts against the Billy Child's Emsemble with his chamber jazz and adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life ablum "Pathways" is a good example for a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey leads in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daughertys "Deux Ex Machine" is given for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackeys "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestra with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to southern California, the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonics and performed in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer Avner Dorman, based in L.A., was also nominated for his Mandolin concert.
Classic nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
Five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckners Symphonies No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daughertys "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys "Dreamhouse" by Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrifium - the Art of the Castrati" by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.
In the opera category, "Lulu from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hases "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Chor des Mariinsky Theatres; and Arthur Sullivans "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, the party for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty was nominated for "Deus Ex Machine", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionattem Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Hinderer" for a Grammy.
Pärts Symphony No. 4 was staged and recorded on January 4 at Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonics under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salons.
The approximately 30-minute piece bears the title "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondoline Concert" received a nomination in the instrumentalsolo category with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. reported that he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the artist Avi Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
The leader Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category orchestra award for a recording of the works Strawinskis with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumental soloists, pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, Geiger Julia Fischer and Harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
This year, only women were nominated as vocalists, including Anne Sofia von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category Classic Crossover, Soprano Jesse Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Moscow in Temecula wins the approval of the Planning Committee
The building of a mosque in Temecula was found after a five-hour, often hot public hearing the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee.
Critics proposed the project to promote both terrorism and traffic.
However, according to a statement by the Commission from Wednesday evening, the new religious centre meets the local rules and will become an aesthetic perspective.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, I'm proud of it."
"It shows that justice reigns."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"In this language, wonderful people live."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions on and against the construction of the centre lasted almost until midnight, with the votes distributed on both sides according to the press enterprise quite equally.
The debate was continued on the website of the newspaper.
"There is no America anymore," said one comment.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the state of freedom is dead in the sand."
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on New York City on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has called for violence.
His community with about 135 families has lived peacefully in the Riverside County for years. But they wanted a bigger and better place than the warehouse they rented together with a water filter plant manufacturer.
The new, approximately 2,300 m2 large mosque in the Mediterranean style is to have two minerals and become about 13m high.
It is intended to take place on the approximately 17,500 m2 large plot at Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsen-resistant microbes could allow new forms of life on earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign type of bacteria that can live by arsenic, among other things, opens up new opportunities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists have discovered this unusual bacteria here on earth, it is in their view a sign that life is possible even without the elements considered to be vital.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic."
"This makes it something very special, although it is almost a kind of 'foreign' form of life," explained Paul C.W. Davies from Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online issue of Science magazine.
So far, six main elements have been considered as vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as scientists discovered, the bacteria in the California Mono Lake grow even further when it replaces phosphorus by arsenic.
"There is a question of what else is possible," said the co-author of the Ariel D. Anbar report from Arizona State University.
Discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms, so to speak.
The study deals with microbes found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details were disclosed about the discovery gave rise to too widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could deal with the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms can initiate biochemical processes using other elements and that the 'standard elements', which are absolutely vital to our opinion, are not necessarily specified," said Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," said Cockell.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA's Astrobiological Institute, which conducted the study, chose the Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Since Arsen and Phosphorus are chemically identical, they assumed that microbes that are both exposed may be able to replace one element through the other.
"The toxicity of arsenic is primarily based on the fact that it is chemically similar to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so big that arsenic works differently than phosphorus. It reaches into our biochemical system, where it almost all melts," Anbar explains.
The researchers replaced the bacteria GFAJ-1 with an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in Phosphorus, it also shows that an arsenic-based form of life can occur naturally, either on earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new. But until now there was no working example.
Arsen came more often in the early years, she says, so science has come to the conclusion that early life forms have used it.
"That gives reason for the assumption that life may have evolved otherwise than in the early age of the Earth," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simons research team.
The research work was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs who were stolen in front of a Bellflower motel were found, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's statement, on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when unknown the 2006 Chevrolet Express van in which the animals were placed before a Bellflower Motel 6 night, the authorities said.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two of them were discovered on Wednesday evening, says Steve Whitmore, a speaker of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is: the dogs are good," says Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not make accurate information about the dog’s site yet to the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigations are still ongoing."
"We don't want to say anything anymore," explains Whitmore.
"We're following some leads."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available on Thursday for information.
They took their two dogs in a district home in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's representatives found the truck and the two dogs in different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old rüde, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog - were reportedly unharmed.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, Rickard and Peek, on behalf of their Japanese owners at the competition this week, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were on this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city because Trace should participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions the days before the AKC/Eukanuba Show.
South California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the pair of dog shows to dog shows.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stayed in motels and park their delivery cars in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxing alley, a parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - with their motel.
The thick Akitas and Corgis stayed in the truck because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen on Tuesday at 6:00.
Peek promised anyone who could give a reference to the Corgis a finder's reward. The animals were implanted microchips for identification.
On Thursday, it was not yet established whether a finder's pay was paid.
The lion breaks again after the legal approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New York competition judge officially approved the "prepared" faith plan to cover the debts of $5 billion and the 86-year-old entertainment company to prepare the way for new films and television shows.
According to Thursday's statement, the plan meets the requirements of US competition law, so that the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, is no longer in the way. Barber and Birnbaum are presented to the somewhat mirrored studio as the main business leader.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 actually enters into force only when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned loan of $500 million to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself brings $75 million, runs the company. Financing is expected to take place by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the mandate of the Investment Bank Moelis & Co, the company manager who fought with interest payments of $300 million per year to help solve their financial problems.
In August, Managing Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, who was known for his activity at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve MGMs' financial concerns and pay out more than 140 believers in the studio lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided to offer the company at the end of 2009.
But the auction only attracted a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the creditors.
In the spring this year, everything began in advance when the MGM team began with the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debate and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM officially won the competition in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million-dollar bonus for their work.
The share of Moelis & Co. that has already received $1.2 million is $9.5 million.
Cooper, which was paid monthly for the company's management of $375.000, receives a 4 million success bonus.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year the studio brought out only one film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to come to the cinemas in early 2012.
They also plan two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate loan between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share of these two films that are to be created under Peter Jackson's control.
The investor Carl Icahn, who has funded approximately 18% of MGM-Darlehen, tried a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not produce any results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can travel a considerable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jumping lines or about 48 doses Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, I visited three electronic toy companies in search of $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wolesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moores Law had come into force. This year the technology players are more efficient and cost a little less than last year.
And although less new toys with their own website appear, there is a wider range of this kind, webkinz and Club Penguin.
There are increasingly button cell-operated toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years old) are plumbing figures, as large as seaweeds that sing a note when pressing on their belly.
Once pressing corresponds to a note, through multiple pressing you can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: If you start with the press once, you can't stop anymore.
For a combination of send and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
On the basis of the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interchanges such as 'Simon says', and thanks to the innovative shear feet with wheel-blocking it dominates the Moon-Walk.
Children who test the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning games.
Now he's back there (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of questionnaires that allow a car ride to a class, with a better conscience with autocorrection function as a teacher.
If you don't want to trust your child's smartphone, there are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qvaluey keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as educational as on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, brighter screen after Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL of Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not larger than a string wooden box and have a own LED screen.
The game is to combine the blocks with words before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised letter competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go alone after the offer in the playgrounds, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal at the Penguin Club, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12) containing a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive sufficient credits for two more parts at the Penguin Store Club.
It can be roller shoes or a puffle animal.
The latest head cell microbot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The caper moves quickly to 12 vibrating silicone bands in any direction.
It's fun to send him out of the spells by an errorgarten.
And he's holding a few.
We fell from the kitchen table and even spent some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police in China become softer
As a training officer, Tang Shenbin walked over a city square, checked his nervous substations and gave orders with military authority and dampened voice.
He wanted his female members of Chengguan - China's robust watchmen of urban order, afraid and despised for their arbitrary raids and their addiction to violence - to impress the audience.
"Stand right there!"
"Look straight!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how beautiful girls are!"
Four girls, barely growing up to the teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and pants standing tight.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in straight line.
Four neat hides sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white strips.
"For me, they look on average," said Mr Tang.
"Models are beautiful."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of Chinese city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grays.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by lower stars: According to 2009 reports, 50 officials had an improperly installed ambulance and aimed at the operator until it packed up after half an hour and left the space.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthened by the urban police forces. They have been selected especially because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They're supposed to give the brutal police a softer, feminine aspect.
Unfortunately, however, Scarlett Johansson would hardly have succeeded in improving the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commands.
Right, so the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials may enforce urban laws only by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei beat an audience to death when she filmed with her cell phone how they beat a protest against a mullhalde.
Last year a training manual was stolen from Beijing officials and published on the Internet. It describes how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai Watermelon Dealer suffers from a number of handicrafts with five officers brain injuries.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows officers trained in China in an attack on street dealers.
"Chenguan scares the government," complained the Chinese Daily national newspaper last year, after further controversy about the tactics.
The newspaper demanded "really thorough purification".
Skeptics find the current approach clearly insufficient.
When the District looked for eight female recruits in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether women should have real jobs or only as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to a job announcement, women from 18 to 22 years of age were looked for with good figure and harmonic facial features.
You should be above average size - more than 1.5 m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with the reaching of the 26th year of life.
According to the officials, the activity for women over 25 is too hard.
"The most important is her image", an unnamed district official reported on the almost government website Rednet.com.
"If the candidates get the job, it first depends on their appearance, such as size, weight, facials, etc.."
Then come temperament and inner qualities.
"Seventy Chengguan are like flower pots," he said and added, "but they have other duties beyond that."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of the City Administration of the District, does not wish to undertake this description,
however, it was noted that in China, the size standards for both sexes are not uncommon.
The same applies to uniform facial tracks.
Whether to compare it with a good look is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical configurations do not need to apply.
"We cannot use lahmen or Buckligen here," said Mr Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrolled the Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple covers and a well-formed mouth.
She did not feel that she was so valuable in her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic view.
Her colleague with the grübchen, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their data, they do not regret the short attitude, as they had more ambitious career plans than simply sneaking through the gases to prevent them from doing business.
Each morning, the strips deal with about twelve street dealers who try to sell as many boards and tofus pretzels as possible before they are pursued.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We've told you so often!" explains Fr. Xu, a dealer who had run away on foot and had left his nudel kitchen stuck on a bicycle car temporarily in the loop.
According to the officials, the activity is rather monotonous.
"It's almost every day the same," says Huang Jing, 20, who studies sales in leisure.
"All Routine."
One reason is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of traders, as their male colleagues do.
They can only threaten criminals to report to their male supervisors.
This is intended to protect them from public enemies whose officials in China are often exposed.
In this year, hundreds of people from Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, randalized, after the rumors went on, Chengguan officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen policemen and Chenguan officials were injured at night, 14 government vehicles were dropped or burned.
Xindu has been eliminated from such violence so far.
But rest is not to be excluded.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officers patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, which was repaired instead of in a workshop.
The owner cried Zeter and Mordio.
After a 15-minute drive, the officials turned their way to their vehicles and drove on with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male strip coordinator, remained back. He turned his white name sign to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we're going to talk."
"Many times but also physically," explains Mr. Li at night.
"Most of the time people start fighting."
Senator Ensign will not be charged
The State Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice released Senator John Ensign from the charges, who, after his affair with a former election assistant and his attempt to give his husband a lobbying activity, were picked up against him, announced the senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious legal challenge against Senator Ensign, the Republican of Nevada. Until the scandal that caused strikes across the country and a damper in his career, he was considered a possible candidate for the Republican presidency for 2012.
As Senator Ensigns' office announced, he was "highly pleased" with the judgment following the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate's Ethics Committee could impose a further disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that investigations against Senator Ensign had been conducted and that there were no further charges in this case.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In your opinion there was sufficient evidence that Ensign missed the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents published for the first time in October 2009 at the New York Times gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election assistants, was involved in licit orders to purchase his silent business with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was active during a campaign of Ensigns as treasure master.
Ensign contacted some political friends to provide Hampton with work. According to the documents and interviews, he took over for them after setting up Hampton's lobby.
Since Hampton was recently in Ensigns' election team, for a year he was not allowed to take up lobby work for his former employer or the entire Senate.
According to ethical experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, was against the so-called ban on turn-door lobbying.
According to the published index, "all seem to be dealing with an agreement and the violation of the door-to-door states," says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who stand in the government's sight.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other Ethikanenwalten said that the Ministry appeared very cautious in taking political charges after a number of defeats which were pursued by the media with great interest, including the decision last year, to drop the charges against the former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct by the State Prosecutor.
Public prosecutors "are obviously horrendous," said Melanie Sloan, president of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in the US parliamentary and governmental circles), a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview, he received a telephone call from a public prosecutor on Monday, and another day, on which he was informed that the Ministry would not raise complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensigns had cooperated with the lawyers to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law".
Mr Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had put before the public prosecutors.
"I'm not sure I'm going to go into the details of the conversation between the Ministry of Justice and me. Just be told, we believe we've made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to institute investigations for a separate complaint by the ethics group after a payment of $96,000 by Mr Ensign's parents to Hamptons against the Federal Election Act.
The electoral commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that had long supported the senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton was found thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyist.
An e-mail from December 2008 states that after Mr. Hampton moved on as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings Chief of Staff, John Lopez, he had an understatement with Mr. Hampton, in which he informed him that he was at the Ministry of the Interior because of an "acclap".
Mr. Ensign also agreed with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after this Mr. Hampton had set up lobbying work.
For the first time in the last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his electors for bringing information about this affair to the public and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had stood in the rank of the Republicans in fourth place.
After many months he was no longer incarcerated, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was striving for a third term of office in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the goal of police investigations, his press spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, the senator hoped that the Ethics Commission would follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and set up his investigations very quickly.
"Sentor Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire Calling on Twitter
Half a dozen of them were in courtrooms.
In a minute attack, they sent their reports on cruel testimony on Twitter.
In the end, so the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and begging children in a house that went into flames.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of having killed three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the trial on the death sentence that the jury has pronounced falls.
However, Mr Hayes' lawyers have already filed applications before the Court of Justice for reasons of appeal and for years to be held by the courts.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intensive reporting of the process - including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - has come to a "circuit atmosphere" and so widespread, immediate penetration of suspicious details, so that the jury has been unduly influenced by public equipment.
This opposition could lead to the appeal court dealing with the question of whether new technologies would be required for new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced during this process, I believe that it is really a danger when the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of each individual to a fair process," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes' chief defender.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue, of the Supreme Court of the Chamber, said last week that the applications by decision were short and binding when he said that the new media would be "supervised carefully" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court rulings have found that the report on famous cases has raised doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In his historic decision of 1966, the United States Supreme Court dismissed the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopathian from Cleveland who was supposed to have killed his wife and said in his decision that there would have been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media.
Some believe that the TV series and the game film "On the Flight" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court rulings, which Mr. Hayes considered a half century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication routes from the courtroom, which were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the new media in processes that are being pursued by a wide public," said John J. Donohue III, professor at the Stanford Law School, who examined the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is voluntarily suspended.
Professor Donohue said some appeals courts could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of an immediate communication from the courtroom could make the proceedings fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many who present the lawyers of Mr. Hayes to discuss the matter over years and thus raise a condemnation.
The defenders also claimed, for example, that Mr. Hayes could have already been convicted, when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurymen by showing them gross tattoo photos during the jury selection.
Some of the jury said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and her daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, would have met with abscheu.
The defendants say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty Constitution, and argue that the judge has wrongly replaced a jury who has been a critic of the State Prosecutor and that he would have unduly put pressure on the verdict when he made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jury wasn't isolated.
However, their arguments about the influence of the detailed report on the process may be of the greatest interest.
In a verdict they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election for the Governor's office and for the American Senate by the candidates.
They argued that the new media had continually re-evaluated the flames of emotion over the case.
"A day-to-day trend of media pipers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "have not experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even across the country."
Its focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages were more extensive than reports, which are less slowly replaced, was a technically hostile view that reduced the reporting on future processes.
However, some lawyers said appeals courts would often be confronted with the argument, social and technical changes would require adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayers' lawyers are strengthening this claim.
In her objection, she referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which Dr. Sheppard's conviction was lifted on the basis of the report and made it clear that the new media needed new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can kindness connect the divorcing?
After a campaign of schimping words and negativity this week, there is little courtesy in Washington.
Is it a real bilateral cooperation or a moment of illusion before you return quickly to the fight of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the summits of the Congress did not lead to a breakthrough in the major issues that had to be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck session" at the end of a period of government, in which decisions were no longer taken.
After all you hear, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides nor a respect for their shared responsibility but rather an empty episode of a partial collection.
The public meeting of the President's Deficit Commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that continue to exist between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months can create a mutual respect that obscures the ideological gap that continues to divide members.
This is hardly enough to claim that there has been a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise is required, while one is trying to weigh the limits of public opinion and the voter's patience after a renewed party war.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are miles apart.
Finally, the November election in Washington has at least voted mildly for a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, now working for the "Ethical and Public Policy Center".
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections create participative passions that die again.
And that's good."
In some matters, especially in those on the agenda of the "Lame Duck session", Republicans and Democrats have hardly any choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports it.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, whether it's temporary or permanent.
Similarly, there is a compromise on the increase in unemployment, although only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the preferential tax reductions for the rich are being made while they refuse to support the unemployed.
After meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased that you can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
But William Glasson of Brookings Institute warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the Lame Duck session does not necessarily lead to permanent cooperation of the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, as he says, a phase of non-conformity is more likely, perhaps even impossible.
"After the things that have to be done are done, this short-term psychology will be turned into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this sceptis is shared by many - leads to genuine cooperation.
"I see a lot of what's going on from today to 2012 as a pre-fighting, or shadow boxes, for the 2012 main event," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the opening up of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who were well educated.
As the Republican leaders are concerned, they may also be too high for poker, they know that they have to try to keep their promises to reduce government spending and to put health reform without force.
These party lines are already clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include a tax reform and the lifting of some taxes and the lifting of the pension age and the reduction of government expenditure.
The vice-presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own estimate, have so much pressured them to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they cannot be ignored anymore.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan for formal recommendation and they are fighting a lot to get even closer to this number.
The largest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the Board, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little room or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston says two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans at the Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes when the Republicans of Obama challenge the state budget, tax and health system, then followed by a phase of greater bilateral cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proved that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still wish that the two parties work together.
If confrontation leads to a gas, as in 1995, both parties have to pay attention to the public response.
Anyone convicted of losing will have to change the course and look for a compromise.
That may in fact be an optimistic view.
Participation and polarization are now greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and the Congress Republicans than between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of the two parties see 2010 as a clear example of a much broader election in 2012.
This is how many Americans can welcome the kindness that is shown this week.
But on both sides it will take much more effort to find a common denominator in the questions that the two still separate from each other.
Secured US document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of the "Cleptocracy" and it gives part of the bribery and protection money it collects to the Kremlin. Thus, in February, the American message in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service are paying high protection fees so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate business, but also from organised criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "vertical of authority" - takes its part of the money that the leader moves up.
The memo sent under the name of Ambassador John Beyle to Washington was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accused him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly any evidence that it would have been cleared in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected drafts of corruption over the years, and he has won numerous complaints against such accusations.
In September he declared a Russian television broadcast when he was asked for a documentation that suggested he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual that, as in the Ambassador's report, individuals are named, and it is not surprising that this is done by a diplomat in a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the Moscow government with crime has led some to call it "distorted" and conclude that the government is more like a leptocrat than a government," said the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a concept from the world of criminals / the Mafia, which literally means "dach" or protection), which extends to the police, State Security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the Office of the Public Prosecutor as well as to the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov stands at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the militias are on the second stage."
"Lastly, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city does not offer any help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB is cashing out money from the largest companies and that the police are arresting small business people.
A source, that is, "declared that Moscow's business owner understands that it is best to obtain protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organised crime), as they have not only more weapons, resources and powers than criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer asked as before."
The memo notes that while the collection of money is comprehensive, protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business very quickly closed before - because of some prejudice.
Medvedev has repeatedly talked about combating corruption, but at the same time noticed that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men going into the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said George Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of the violence, as he says, corruption is inevitable.
Worldwide, according to Indem, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154 in place of a more recent survey into the global perception of corruption by the non-State organization Transparency International (countries are listed from "at least corruption" to "at most corruption").
The revelation of the memo of the American message, which took place after Moscow's time late in the evening, will surely trigger suspicions within the Russian government, although since Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow's error, it can also be an opportunity for the Kremlin to claim that the problems are solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and responded furiously to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that our interaction is an important factor in internal policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans forced to face the past
In a weakly lit, accentuated classroom with dirty and dazzling walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Srng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule as the "slayer", the commander in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg remains popular in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the capitalization of Khmer Rouge against the government, long-standing supporters are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed the victims the public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that tells the story of Khmer Rouge for the first time to children of former soldiers.
And in July, a UN and Cambodian community tribunal condemned for the first time a former member of Khmer Rouge, when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Slang torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the duke, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, their efforts to reconcile and reintegrate into the society of Cambodia.
"There is still denial and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For her, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It splits families itself."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, 1.7 million people were estimated to have been executed or died of diseases, processing or hunger.
When the Vietnamese fell apart and the Pol Pot-Ied government collapsed in 1979, the regime's remnant and its military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
They spread here until December 1998, when the last movement capitalized, unrest.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the Guerilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok brought the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of the 1990s, when a peace agreement that was signed by the UN in 1993 led to the country's first democratic elections, large groups of Khmer Rouge began to move to the government, leading to the capitalizations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not died, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh prison, where he waited for his trial.
When their graces no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the devastating poverty of rural Cambodian chess and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though few elite officials of Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they put down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers.
"These people have only benefited very little from the capitalization," said Sok Leang from the centre of justice and reconciliation, which in whole Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng, holds public forums
"They are anchored in the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They grow up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who joined in 1974 as a teenager of the Rhmer Rouge, fought for Veng before he left in 1998 to lead a life as a poor traveler.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the Court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister, before the Court.
The task of the Court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not stated whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has little to do with calming the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on Im Chaem, 64 years old, which during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s was district chief in the province of Manteay Meanchey.
In 2007, she had told the officials of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms, a project where thousands of forced workers were likely to die.
On a hot evening, I returned from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun was long shadowed on the dried grass, the chaem refused to discuss their past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court were to suggest it, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecution, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain, the court would accuse more suspicious, although experts and historians are discussing this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to be able to move forward, Chhang Youk from the Documentation Centre said.
"Amenity with the Khmer times means bringing together the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put together these broken parts, so that you can understand everything."
The centre created the first school book approved by the government over the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the Ministry of Education's High School, which contains fewer than four pages over the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the Court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court are reaching for influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains, one of the smoldering and plastic-moulded roads leads to a rectangle of black rust, covered with a rusty roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here after his death in 1998 on a tire.
Noum Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile salesman on the street, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last place of rest, where she'll find a bush of ripe bananas - in the hope that he'll bring her luck.
Belarus has agreed to no longer collect weapons uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign for global nuclear safety, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The US government had been trying for years to convince Belarus not to collect highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a height last spring.
But U.S. government officials told Washington Post that in the last two months, two secret agreements were reached with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of gun-resistant uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuclear Summit of 47 Nations" in April, which had excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really thrilled by the fact that they wanted a seat at the Nuclear Safety Summit (from 2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure everything in four years' time nuclear material.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to release their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear safety summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to maintain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weaponized, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"That's our raw material... we won't make dirty bombs and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago when it showed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first move to remove the Uran from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly radiated, says official.
It was loaded into a special suit, which is more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, say official.
The second run was decided on Monday and was carried out by aircraft according to the official.
The US government pays $14 million for these efforts, with most of the money flowing into Belarusian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was very carefully coordinated and agreed to build trust," said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy working on Global Risk Reduction.
The James Martin Centre for Non-Prolonged Studies estimates that in this year, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-enabled uranium as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus intends to dissolve its stock by 2012.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, primarily because of the harsh disregard for human rights of Lukashenko.
But the status of Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
"The progress of these global security issues is welcome, the United States of America and Belarus announces that an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and is essential for the country's and its citizens' progress," it explains.
No objections from the Spanish government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantanamo, as reflected in a telegram by the Ambassador of the U.S.A. in Madrid.
This reflects the documents sent by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily "El País" (by cable). It is added that the former deputy government chief María Teresa Fernández de la Vega asked the Spanish government to be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying Spain are being monitored properly."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which the aid for human rights-related practices in a thousand countries, including Spain, was challenged, the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed themselves.
The Deputy Head of Government stated that the Council's report "has met Zapatero in its absence" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed, Spain has no objections to the secret service flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed," in order not to be "unprecedented to be surprised," Aguirre reported per cable.
The former Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has only little influence because they are in the hands of the judges."
In January 2007, the Public Prosecutor Vicente González informed the message that he would not block the initiative to request the declassification of documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Minister of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any burdensome or sensitive information," the ambassador explained after a discussion with the public prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the United States was more concerned about "probably coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the classified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts to deal discreetly with governments," Aguirre complained.
At a lunch in March 2007, when US ambassadors and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are foolishly concerned about their independence and do what they think is appropriate", he instructed his employees to avoid "absolute rhetorical comments in order to overcome tension."
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the conduct of the PP in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt the fact that the government of Zapatero's actions in the United States, which could have been subjected to human rights violations, tolerated or deliberately ignored, will be struck with capital, even if these revelations could have a negative effect on the government of the United States," he said.
The child killer stood up and complained on the Internet about the "museum" of the motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in Galician Way"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this name, which she leads from small to small, she keeps with a cousin and at least a friend contact. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña where she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
In order to understand this, you need to know her love life, which reconstructs the ABC daily newspaper based on testimony from her family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman entered into a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrial worker in 1998.
She was a year old.
Shortly after she had dissolved her relationship, she was known to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his ex never let him carry out a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she had a different relationship.
The chosen was Alberto, a young man from Lousama, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look after herself on the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the contents of her messages, it can be concluded that her love relationship broke and they separated.
In March 2008 she is alone on Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very peculiar and angry because I came to work."
"When I told him, he found it good, but now he notices of course what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not be free to do and let him do what he wants."
Later she mentioned a message she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or get me an address to which I can send you the boys."
She complained, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy at my mother's, I'll get him when I'm back."
In May she says of her return to her village: "This week I will go there, but I will only stay there until 19th, because I have to introduce myself to a job on 20th, if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she'll take her first-born when everything's okay.
"He will be with whom he must be, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him with someone other than my mother," a questionable intention when considering their bad relationship.
There's another mail in July.
When she writes it, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th was dead.
"César is satisfied on the one hand, not on the other."
"On one side he's with me and the place he likes a little, but on the other, he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will visit a summer course, so I have less expense for the girl."
On 17th: Memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss by César who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. You see, if he wants, he finds me, so bad."
On the 30th, "The boy is doing well. He's going to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Victor, her current partner, there is one: "He shoots money at me."
On the Internet, in anime and mangablogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now closed, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prison hospital".
"Terror in the Gallega (Overwriting)".
The last man who lived together with her, a determined hunter, explains having a conscience, because he feels guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica was transferred yesterday from the Centre for Prisoners to Menorca to Palma's provincial prison.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, explained that she could not remember the outcome of the case, "and she had no intention of harming the little."
She had previously stood, however, to drink César in the bathtub and to have his body in a suitcase.
Defence and public prosecutors applied for a psychiatric opinion.
Partyo Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, the PP could play a crucial role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
According to the significant increase in votes and votes in the last regional elections, the PP has already taken a look at Parliament's elections - or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes obtained by this party in those elections is normally twice as high as in the Catalonia elections.
In this way, the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316.222 in the 2006 regional elections.
On the last Sunday, the PPC reached 384.091 votes.
If this upward trend - the result of the redirection of the PSC's vote and the binding of the electorate of the PP - should continue, the analysts of the PP predict that in the parliamentary elections, the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressional delegates, while the CIU also won four (now 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 (of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a member - it currently has three - while the ICV would hold or could win one.
However, if the election calendar is to be kept, the next date will fall with the municipal elections in May 2011. Also, the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scale to prepare the socialist rule for an end, in four provincial cities and with its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the city's largest administrations: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists can neither achieve a majority nor take back their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not surprising that this party will lose its representation in the municipality of Barcelona, in which it would have to obtain 5% of the votes.
On the other hand, the PP recorded an increase in its vote in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the main role in Tarragona's revolution. There they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
An Lérida is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Angel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Casteldefels or Reus, the People's Party was able to record a significant increase.
The PP is currently represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and seeks to form lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaida thousands of travel passes
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three others in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian police officers arrested by the Barcelona Police Department were the Thai-controlled dshihadist cells, the various Al Qaida groups, including the "Move to the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Thaiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the Attentat in Bombay, who claimed the 2008 106 dead - with his fists.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior has a major role to play in these investigations, which he assures so far that with the "Operation Kampai" the Al Qaidas fake device has been "weaked" worldwide and thus "their ability to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cells were active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were faked and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida was composed, so that their "combatants" could freely cross the borders of European and other Western countries.
The discovered cell is not the only dishhadist network that was active in Europe. Therefore, other European police units have also been involved in the investigation, and it is not to be excluded that similar attacks will occur in the area of the EU in the next few days, such as those carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Ashhar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatounde Agunbiade were arrested) another was carried out in Thailand, where Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt were arrested as well as the Thai Siriklaya Kijbumrung.
They had led Bangkok out of the cells that were left in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - a part of it was destroyed in 2009 - in particular stole tourist passages in accordance with the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents on the names of men aged 25 to 45 had to be issued and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to show visa marks.
In the investigation circles, it will be stressed that until now no connection could be established between those arrested in Catalonia and the assassination in Bombay, although the author of this attack was "Laschkar e-Thaiba", one of the recipient groups of the stolen and subsequently fake travel passports in Spain.
However, it should be recalled that a few days before the assassination of Catalonia, several thousand dollars were sent through a money transfer company, which was "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "Commandos", which provided an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized extensive documentation.
PP requires a meeting of the tax agreement from Mas
The president of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, yesterday, took the opportunity to personally propose their conditions to support his entry as President-in-Office of the Generality, which are not different from those already put forward during the election and can be summed up with the priority of economic recovery and the absence of regionalist independence constituents, as a financial balance agreement proposed by the regionalist leader at the height of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan People's Party asked for the security of Arthur Mas, who gave her the 18 MPs she had won last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to feel unattainable. For the candidate from the CU civil-regionalist party is indicated that at least one of the opposition parties abstained from voting at the time of his entry into office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to join in the upcoming parliamentary elections depend on a possible agreement with the PP. However, the talks that the mass conducts with the rest of the parties now revolve around Catalonia.
As regards the Chair of the PPC, he called for the back of an agreement on the financial compensation between the State and the Autonomous Region - like in the Basque country - to support the entry into office "all discourses relating to the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and to be held in the back of an agreement on the financial compensation between the State and the Autonomous Region - like in the Basque country - and that the CIU leader would even like to submit a referendum.
Both political leaders are common to make the proposed political apparatus of regional administration easier and to abolish inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on the entry of Mass are dealt with by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a severe opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Old Testament confirms that deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the old house in Olot do not exclude that their manager killed over eleven older people
The senior caregivers of La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave yesterday a press conference, in which they exposed the harm that criminal actions Joan Vila Dilmés - the supervisor who killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible - had added to the institution during his work.
Joan Sala, the head of the old nursing home, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat would like to accuse the responsible (for the death of the case), but "the right and our obligation of liability force us to accept the process and the civil liability".
The institution must not only take a social loss of sight because it did not establish the criminal actions of the manager in due time, but also now pay a high amount of compensation calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victim.
Joan Vila Dilmé has been told that the first crime will return to August 2009 and that he has been killed since then.
The judge arranged for the exhumation of eight bodies - ex-patients of the nursing home - as he assumed that no doctor had examined the deceased personally, but the formalities were developed by telephone due to their age and diseases.
The leader of La Caritat derailed this point and stated that "remaining measures could never have been the reason for the events."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there was no indication in the dispute of any person other than the accused."
The man who was already baptized as "the Angel of Death" was 11 murders yesterday and explained that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and had murdered the second old lady a half months later.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had given a mixture of various anti-inflammatory drugs.
The manager of La Caritat explained that the access of staff to drugs was only difficult to control.
The insulin injections and the anticoagulant cocktail were used by the caregiver for six of nine crimes committed in order to free the patients with death from their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory investigations will show whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victim or whether he burned it from the inside by presenting them with lead loops, as he reportedly did in three women who were murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, there is no belief in the manager's statements, not even with regard to the number of standing murders that could be even more than that. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements before the court and that it made no sense to change his behavior after eight successful murders suddenly.
They say they made themselves available for this reason and to clarify the scope of these events of justice.
European Central Bank (ECB) threats
The investors reacted very sharply yesterday to the threat of the ECB President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our reaction capabilities."
The risks of euro periphery countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can deceive itself, and that the euro has barely given up on points that cause concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an unilicited market, which, to the extent that it breaks up again, however, is due to the closure of shorter and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose fear for a long time.
Today, one month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to withdraw our liquidity measures, to which the ECB must make a withdrawal for the fourth time in two years tomorrow, and probably a few more times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the completion of the plan for the purchase of public debt, since it was ineffective, as well as the abolition of all exceptional liquidity measures.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least by March" and the quarterly invitations to tender with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity by at least June.
We also expect that the programme for the purchase of bonds will continue and a strong signal will be issued.
If the created expectations are not met, the excellent response of the markets will be rejected from yesterday and if we are stuck to take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As with the ECB meeting in May, in which the Bank confirmed not to consider the purchase of public debt securities and the subsequent collapse of the markets, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and sustainable.
In May she showed the teeth and on Wednesday she said she had bought a lot already, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the auction of one year's state titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The government's asset management accounted for only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve and thus reflected a change in perception of the markets according to the words of Trichetes.
In Ireland the figures of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The sum is estimated at approximately 10 000 million in the short term and possible additional 15 000. There is time until February to acquire private capital or these banks are made public.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after it did not recognize the problem with the stress test in July, the figures in the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government must receive parliamentary approval of its new budget on Tuesday, and since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel made her speech on the summit of the Heads of State and Government on December 14 more moderately. There is political unity asked to show that we play the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethovens.
The Spanish President presented yesterday the plan of action to be adopted by the Council on Friday.
Remuneration, transparency in the autonomous regions, as well as in the financial institutions, the reduction of government deficit, liberalisation, privatization and labour procurement measures.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has contributed 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a significant auction of a three-year public bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect. That is why we call for a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our guilt capability.
For Spain, the request for an aid plan would be a self-suffering sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The treasure has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be cut off without time.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with the Moto Caesar's wife: "Now not only the Being but also the Light."
All right, let's do that!
At the request of his children, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Eulen met with Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owner of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not float away.
David Álvarez, founder of the company group, will challenge the meeting of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, since he considers them to be "absolutely useless". His children will be tried to receive a majority to control the administrative bodies of the company - the owner of the vineyard Bodega Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal measures for a new chapter of justice in their fight to control a part of the company group.
The founder of the largest holding for business services does not seem to be ready to submit in his legal dispute to the control of the El Enebro authorities.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors from five of his seven children, who were appointed as members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders' meeting of 18 January this year, which has already been registered in the Register of Commerce.
The meeting of the company of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the Madrid Chamber of Commerce No. 2 for the 16th, triggered a new thunderstorm at the Alvarez family shot.
The summons of the judge to convene the assembly is the only legal way to ensure that the meeting is convened.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz will be recognized by David Álvarez as a "depressed means of the applicants - his five children - designed to be recognized by legal findings, fraudulent techniques and misuse of law for the undeclared assembly of 18 January", as official speakers explain.
This argument is the basis for attacking the assembly in the background to declare it "absolutely useless".
These same protagonists, who dwell in discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully in June to convene a meeting in the right direction.
At El Enebro - property company and owners of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, in addition to other assets - David Álvarez' seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, the founder of the service group, according to family protocols, demands the right of use of 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the case that the judge has decided in the hearing to deal with the complaint for which a date has not yet been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since the entry of Red Bull into the world of Formula 1, its history has been marked in this read universe by the speed of surprises and successes.
At first, no one gave the new attention and despite his ever-increasing performance during the last season, all at the end of November were on the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without the ability of the German pilot and world master Sebastian Vettel or the power of the engine of Renault, the "Geheim gun", which the Multi Siemens Red Bull put into his hands, and thus created a victory team, became a legend.
In fact, it is a powerful software for the simulation of processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes not related to authors.
This software, known as PLM, was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy works and high-precise instruments.
A reliable reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built to avoid errors and excessive costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' Industrial Department, explains that using this software in Formula 1 - Factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and perform the changes and improvements that are detected on the race and at the tests.
Russwurm argues that in 1992, on average, ten technicians were employed in the train stations, who were able to introduce up to three or four improvements in one season.
In the Red Bulls team today, 180 highly qualified young people are employed. With powerful EDV systems, they carry out analyses and any possible changes to the racing car.
The Siemens Manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all components of Red Bull’s racing car, except for the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transmitted to reality by advanced production systems and high-tech autoclaves within less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of the simulator.
The only limits set by this crazy technical perfectionism are the 40 million dollars that a Formula 1 team can spend on its competitions in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a 50-kilometre location from London.
It is two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are severely restricted.
Everything that's going on there is top secret.
The team includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls true Formula 1 - Helmet is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources placed by the energy-drink manufacturer in the services of his participation in the race, other protagonists hide themselves, whose support is invaluable and their acquaintance is zero.
The company's chief of technology, Steve Nevey, emphasises that five years ago, it was still possible to say that the F&E progress in the field of racing was 50 percent for the win and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed. Technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the pilot's contribution is estimated to 15 percent.
Nevey admits that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will open twenty-one stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in Barcelona yesterday celebrated his first exclusive store in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a sales network consisting of twenty shops with 80 to 100 square meters each intended to open the multi in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees this initiative with the 16 existing sales areas in the wholesale industry, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP España, Helena Herrero, called the refurbished shop at Gran Vía in Barcelona, the property of Pont Reyes, which has been working with HP for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010 and 20 of them in Spain.
The first week was dedicated to Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to betray the coming new openings, but did not conclude that Madrid could be the next goal.
The vice-president, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of loading was always the same. It is based on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American company group advises on this and takes over the exclusive cargo equipment (with interactive products for handling); all shops in Europe will look the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for training staff.
Helena Herrero said it's not a Franchising system and pointed out that the exclusive sales network is intended to "optimise the customer service and the advice of small and small companies when buying and after, even the packaging."
The loading in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service builds a connection to the technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way we can solve in ten minutes problems that sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed in particular for small and small enterprises as well as private customers, because large companies have already entered into their technical customer service contracts," Helena Herro said yesterday.
Sabadell wants his rivals in three years a million customers to 'klau'
Banco Sabadell's managerial board member, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than any other manager. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for banks, but first a new liquidity crisis and prophecy will end the debt war.
However, it looks forward to a break in the interest rates which the banks are trying to offset by increases in fees and in the price of loans.
Sabadell expects to include a million private customers in three years - a feature that still exists.
Sabadell has found the way to spend the next three years, so to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year management plan in 2011.
The objective is not only to survive without raising the public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share of a million private customers - 700 000, when the customers who are going to lose the bank are withdrawn. This is the great challenge facing this bank, because so far it has paid more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year it has received 250 000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, language austerity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank will be presented together with the annual final report.
Only a few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has brought all the plans of the banks together.
Sabadell will complete its four years-old Optima Leadership Plan. This was originally designed for three years, but due to the market situation, he was extended for a business year.
The customers who leave the savings are the main target of the bank.
With a breakfast organised by the APIE, Guardiola stressed, 2011 would be a "hard" year "with a great range".
The manager assumes that Spain only "slow" came out of the crisis.
Moreover, it would be "very difficult", in two or three years "to create work" - essential for the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes that the war on Liabilities - which is punishable by interest margins - will run out, the risk benefits that banks and savings will have to pay for their emissions in order to maintain liquidity will already be offset by the price of credit for emerging gains.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will exert pressure on credit."
"We haven't turned off the shark, but the interest differentials are very high," said Guardiola.
Banesto already issued the order on its branch network on Thursday to restrict the granting of long-term loans and to increase the interest differentials (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager was also informed that the banks were currently pursuing the stategie "to increase the fees", however "within a framework marked by competition".
Sabadells Leadership Plan is based on organic growth, even though the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
He does not, however, ensure that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
"In the coming year everything will change," he assures.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently "absolutely increasing" and does not imply that some Spanish financial institutions will be reduced to red figures.
He is of the opinion that the FROB can replace the money market in capital stockpiles.
After ensuring that Sabadell can also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he deduces the argument of some banks already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be put into effect, but unlike the events in June, it was possible to obtain short-term funding through repossessions and thus cover the crisis.
CECA excludes a second fusion wave of the savings boxes
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a merger wave of the savings banks and stressed the speed with which the sector will be restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings did not take part in the first phase. They held the second round.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish Stock Exchange Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers are completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, rather it was adaptations."
"The main part is completed. It may be that we have thirteen or fourteen instead, but all important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all operations."
In a breakfast organised by the Adea Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon, Olavarrieta said that the concentration process "was completed as soon as possible and that we need to be satisfied with the time-bound process, which was not now established in the context of the business plans with Banco de España", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million is a historically unparalleled process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, so we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he said.
Olavarrieta stated that "there were a number of unfavourable opinions about the slowness of the process, the seriousness and insanity" because "Banco de España urges us to complete the deadline before the end of the year."
The Director General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday assured Spain that Spain had one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" all over the world, and added that those who doubt this "without further knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic situation, we have to make "no worries" about the situation of financial institutions and savings funds that have undergone a "very important" concentration process that will be completed "as soon as possible".
He also reminded the Spanish banks that the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July had been very good.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but at the same time conditions for the whole European Union.
The tensions on the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has introduced new adaptation measures, starting with tax reductions for small and small enterprises, the regulation of time-consuming companies or the abolition of the 426 euro unemployment support, which does not involve unemployment, up to 49 per cent of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30 per cent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the Deputy Head of Government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former President Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It is assumed that Merkel's position is not an error in her public work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
Germany is taking a fundamental new perspective on the design of our future, which coincides with the maintenance of the old traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of Europe's resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south had to leave the euro area.
The second is that the re-introduction of the German Mark - although it now sounds more like Science Fiction - is supported by a majority of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a reorganisation of the euro in line with German proposals: more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; penalties for countries that exceed the deadlines; possibly the payment of some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adaptation measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been distinguished for some time. That is why there are now no excuses.
First of all, both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits in 2009, and the German government took a constitutional reform from the arm to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign for entrepreneurship between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practice of its European partners, including France.
The second sign put the Central European country out as a trade mark painfully exacerbated the decision to save Greece.
At that time, this was severely criticized, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the public opinion published were absolutely against a salvation of Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel comes out again with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements to enable a country to save and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position has been set up as an anti-European position, since it is leading to the crisis in Ireland and all of the following.
In the coming months, we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures to take place from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not think of going beyond it.
It is clear to everyone that, even if unpopular measures must now be taken, the old way of functioning of the euro will no longer exist from this date.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new monetary area in which the opposing countries are severely penalised, forcing them to declare themselves unfit for payment, and in this case the private sector must take part of the cost.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth course, with high savings and investment rates, consumption measurement, productivity and competitiveness improvement, as well as positive external balances.
The other alternatives, based on debt and construction with huge gaps in the balance of payments, as indicated by Spain in booming times, will simply not be taken.
The offer is clear.
And we would do bad things not to understand it.
It is not just about lowering the government deficit by three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will become more peaceful.
And that we will use the opportunities offered to us until spring 2013.
Zapatero seems to have understood this too, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the discussion with the major companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis to create order in his own house has been prepared.
But the red line drawn from Germany is there, and it doesn't look like it would change something.
Among the options under consideration is that we should not exclude the euro area which is completely closed with low-serious countries.
In this case Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sport and regularisation
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show the spirit of invention, but not the will to pass a penalty.
The alleged exclusion of two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of November 23 against the Ajax in the Champions League resulted in a lot of ink being wasted on whether it was an unscrupulous act or not and whether both players should be punished by UEFA.
As is generally known, the two players lost a few minutes before players (his team had already clearly won) time and played several fools to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next league game against the Auxer and thus climb without cards into the next game phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not new practice, it is more often found in the world of football.
It is so widely distributed that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport type - rules.
Part of the debate on the case presented is that a team of the football club Real Madrid (who presented in his Hymne Noble Mot and Honor and had punished his players for similar events on other occasions) played the main role in this and on the dramatization by Maurinho, which added an episode more to his long history than theatrical and provocative technicians.
In any case, the debate is concerned whether these behaviours are not explicitly contrary to the principles of sport which are prohibited by the statutes, which means that these actions are a rule of law. In fact, these practices are in line with the statutes of sport, but they seem to have to be handled.
In this case, the damage caused by the sports spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical insecurities of the opponents, an aspect that was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the unwarranted players taking unfair advantage of the team. Also, this did not happen.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we usually understand under wrong play or rule, because the implementation of the rule has not been carried out in secret to avoid a punishment, but it should be as reprehensible as possible in order to be punished by the judge.
The players waited and accepted the penalty gladly.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders took from the intentional fools.
Here it should be emphasized that the rival was neither placed in a more unfavourable position nor were the benefits of the game played, because the apparent result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players start the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, to a certain degree unknown advantage, as the team could sometimes even opt out. Furthermore, players are given a penalty in this way and go over in the second card cycle, in which they opt out with a card with less than in the first cycle.
It is not so clear whether this is really an advantage.
Finally, such actions are not directed against the sports spirit, which also includes strategic decisions in order to take the greatest advantage of the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to pass a sanctions (that would actually be a clear case of circumvention), they rather wanted to choose when they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without removing a punishment or fleeing from it.
Although the boundary between invention and the environment is confused, I believe that this is a clear case of invention.
I have the impression that the polemic was created due to two factors: because it was about two self-consuming conclusions and because of the nature of the provocative rule transfer.
The damage added to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Offering to catch customers for group weekend evenings in Barcelona
This year's dictatorship allows a wave of reservations to fall on the 16th and 17th December.
The holidays paid by employees themselves are expanding. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the Christmas season that bring together Barcelona's oxygen and leisure activities. But because of the economic crisis, they solve a price-offensive solution to also capture the customer segment that represents the great mass: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the companies and associations in question confirm.
To make accounting even more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on a Friday) has let all orders fall into the week of December 13th, resulting in a wave of reservations of dinners on two peak days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have set up group dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order not to have to give up this tradition, many employees pay these out of their own pocket.
As is always the case, low prices are required, confirmed by the chairman of the Barcelona Hospital Board, Gaietà Farrás.
The representative of the roof association is not waiting to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think it's over a dozen times before they book."
"They would like to go out, but they are very keen on the prices," he stresses.
The business will go well with those who offer "quality at good prices with good service", he adds, and calls us to remember that customers are saving in times of crisis, so prices are asked at 25 euros the most.
In an investigation into various central restaurants, it turns out that the evening of December 17 brings the suppliers to collapse.
The group Soteras says that the requests for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would be booming. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
In another leading group, Andilana, which holds 16 guest houses in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has led the ownership of the calendar to pre-sealed reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for each taste from 19,95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Group, which leads El Mussol, Attic, Quu and 23 locals, one does not lose optimism after the revenue has been re-flowered and good since the second quarter, even if the prospects for Christmas business are not met for a few days.
Sources from the company group indicate that the 18 will also be an overactive day with friends who celebrate Christmas.
A Christmas menu was added to the six groups menu for 30 euros or more than price hot. You have the impression that customers are ready to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and want more details, such as Cava.
Even in some companies you see green sprinkling, so the employees are invited back. This gives the impression that the groups are back in the process.
Fécasarm's top association (with associations such as the Baroque, Restaurant and Leisure Association), the vice president, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are quite "living", although the customers "success a maximum".
The fun at the celebration, however, did not go back, no matter who paid.
Pakistan's nuclear program brings great concern to the United States
Islamabad represents nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
Discoveries of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the United States Department of State, revealed by the Internet portal Wikileaks confirms what enormous concerns the Pakistanic Atomic Programme Washington prepares.
On the edge of clear and succinct details, which offer the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries in matters of atomic security is not enhanced, but rather "takes up", and that the unstable Asian country produces more atomic weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the very nature of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that the weapons are not composed, but their components are stored to make their destruction difficult when possible - Washington prepares sleepless nights.
The following risks include the Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of the former Head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some atomic systems to the area attacked by the Taliban, the probable distribution of nuclear material and the suspense of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people implicated in the nuclear power stations and missile programmes will not only be considered by the United States but also by Russia as a means of preventing violence.
"Pakistan must set up strictly religious personnel to monitor nuclear installations; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organisations have more opportunities to recruit people who work on nuclear or rocket programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a discussion with his North American colleagues.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assanges Internetportal is that cooperation between the United States and Pakistan is lagging behind in nuclear proliferation and the increased pace in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the message, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", states: "there is often no transparency; we do not receive answers on aid offers or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, an official of the State Secret Service for South Asia, confirms that "in spite of the economic catastrophe of Pakistan, nuclear weapons are produced as quickly as any other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit by the chief army leader, General Ashfang Kayani, to "clear up", that "Pakistan's Army has its silent support of terrorist groups."
Hunting for Wikileaks Chief
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the fight against terrorism to prevent new discoveries.
Interpol gives a red warning for the persecution and discovery of assanges.
All that is associated with Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth in which it is difficult to explain.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" for "suffering and persecution" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrangement for arrest.
Besides, it's not new, it's from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the last revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian must commit to Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how they could contact Mr. Assange."
At the request of Sweden, the International Police Office, based in Lyon, France, issued the order on 20th, but was not notified until yesterday after the Swedish authorities had received their mandate.
This is the case. The 188 Interpol countries are assigned to identify and find assangs "to detect and deliver them on time."
Although Interpol cannot arrange for the arrest of a person affected by a red warning, many Member States consider the red warning as a free letter of arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where assanging is likely to stop.
The action prompted Assange's lawyers, who publicly published a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by videoconference.
They also remember that Assange applied for an exit from Sweden and was compared with the state attorney Lavrentity Pavlovich Beria, the security chief of Stalin, who was granted the appropriate authorisation.
"It is like a hunt, not like a legal persecution," the letter complains.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother of Australia admires the innocence of her son - Assange stands up in an unknown place, however not swindling.
On Monday he gave the head of the magazine Time per Skype from an unspecified place from an interview. During the conversation he requested the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that it was responsible for the organisation of North American diplomats to spy out the UN and thus violated international agreements signed by the United States, it had to retreat," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called the application for resignation "laughing and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should put value on the opinion of a type with a website," he explained to the CNN sender.
Obama himself has commissioned a high responsibility for the fight against terrorism, Russell Travers, with the prevention of new document disclosures.
The attempt by President Barack Obama to pay less attention to Assange is contrary to the views expressed by conservative politicians and commentators in these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will be chaired by the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January, has asked the State Department to examine the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "to seize their funds and any person who supports them or makes a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, was still going on, and he had to cancel his statement that Assange had to be "killed".
"Obama had to turn him into a target disc and use an unmanned aircraft or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Anyone who has ever been able to secure information in the government is guilty of treason and everything that is not directed is one too mild punishment," he explained to the sender Fox.
Puigcercós is looking for peace in the ERC with an eyebrow to the Carod nearby
The Republican Leader shall allow the Party to vote in secret on its continuing stay in the Office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to go out of the way for the tenth time an internal riot in the ranks of 11 MPs and half of the electorate-free ERC.
The chairman is aware that his threat of withdrawal is not enough for the close followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is as weak today as its mentor himself and he will not be protected from the same head fractures as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with an eyebrow, which would ensure his position until the next municipal elections.
For the first time yesterday, it was announced that more than 200 regional members of the ERC could speak secretly about their stay in the office.
With election numbers, not with a raised hand.
If the Carodists wanted to leave the president a criminal list, they could do this without having to fear reprisals.
In fact, the chief wants to avoid both the impression of separation and the impression of subjugation under his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel half the votes plus one not confirmed, and he added without indicating percentages, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carods near the President are asking for more than the party's office to be made available. A sufficient gesture as Puigcercos controls the top body of the Congress.
However, since they do not have a sufficient majority to enforce retirement, they will agree with the Board a plan of action from now until May.
They are expected to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic humorification, which will be submitted to the Council on 18th.
Its intention is to grant Puigcercós. In contrast, it is intended to promise to present to the Congress in autumn 2011 what the party summit already considers to be a fact.
The Chairman of the ERC is of the opinion that "polyphony" is damaging stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organisation to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the acting Councillor Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovací thought it was a fact that the chairman of the party will be supported "in exchange for different objectives".
He counted five of them in front of two.
First, the "restructuring" of the board to represent at least 90 per cent of the party members, that is to say the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should finally give up the principle of assembly as a function.
In this way, he condemns a reform of the statutes, which will allow the Congress to hold with elected delegates.
From the end of the full-collection model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team has already fought on the last two congresses to deal with this.
In fact, at the 2008 general meeting, the Party was commissioned to review the principle of assembly at a convention that should address the reform of the Statutes.
This date is still on since the internal appeal of the last few years was not a reasonable approach to this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors lying on the floor, the time could have come to re-assess this matter and to complete it forever.
23 Murdered in November, 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO census, four cases were recorded in Mexico less than 2010.
In November, 23 people were murdered in Mexico, according to MILENIO México's calculations, four were less than in the previous month.
Among the assassins, three women and the founding of two amputated bodies are highlighted in the valley of Mexico.
In the last month of the year, we will face a total of 390 deaths, which are probably related to organised crime.
In the case, a place in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, a place in Toluca, stands out.
The subject had at least three shots caused by firearms, the parade was placed on his head and his feet and hands were tied with a cable.
The next day the body of a person was found in the trunk of a vehicle deposed in the village of Santa Cruz Acatlán of the municipality of Naucalpan.

The man had a wound that came in his neck from the firearm shot.
In the middle of the month, two men were reported to have been killed and found in the trunk of a vehicle de la Hacienda on the streets of the municipality of Tizapán de Zaragoza. In addition to the victims, two murders were found.
One day later, a human head was found in a cardboard box in the village of Valle de los Reyes in the village of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorrigible.
On the 17th, two dead women were discovered in the village of Zoquiapan of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning they found in Huixquilucan the body of a man buried in a yellow-blue deck who, according to the message that his murderers left next to him, was probably named Mario Ríos.
In the village of San Francisco Acuautla of Ixtapapaluca, the body of a woman with bullets of firearms was found in her neck.
On the woman's skin, tattoos of Santa Muerte and chains were discovered with corresponding pictures.
In the last half of the month, the body of a man with at least three shots and a message signed by a criminal group was found in the municipality of Zinacantepec next to a vehicle.
Two days later, the bodies of two men whose heads were covered with tape were discovered and a message was discovered in the municipality of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Against the body was probably a message signed by a criminal organization, which said, "That happens to those who don't participate."
In Ecatepec, two hand-held and foot-held bodies were found with torture marks inside a cab set off by San Agustín at the centre of justice.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first was bought in the village of Cuchilla Ancón and was cut into black plastic bags, and there was a message. The second was tortured and found in the streets of the town of Juárez in a plastic bag.
Next to him, the police found a papa with a message.
China maintains its objectives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
The representative of China stated at COP16 that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and that it would maintain its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, assures Su Wei, the representative of that country at COP16.
In his first public performance at the 16th World Climate Summit of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei assured his country that it would have made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and to transform its industry.
He reported that in the last four years, his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its objectives, but would work with the international community on this issue.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change was divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all aspects, progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which contains the targets for the reduction of emissions of gases, he explained.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the authorities of the states had worked with those of the Central State and the communities in order to achieve the objectives of energy saving, effective use of energy and emissions reduction.
In addition, some multi-year plans have already been or have been completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those that received money from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme on the effective use of energy introduced in the last five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UNO), the government and private hands.
There is also a project at provincial level for climate change, another for the exchange of traditional bulbs by energy savings and another for mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the government in climate change in that country, confirmed that China's efforts would be much larger than usual.
He showed that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China amounted to six tonnes per person, while in the United States it was 100 tonnes. China is responsible for a nine-percent total contribution to environmental pollution.
Similarly, there is unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by 20 per cent over the last five years and is expected to be further achieved by 2020, he said.
Legal Exclusion of Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former PAN Chairman had the right to turn to the National Committee of Rules and to ask for what he was entitled to.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former PAN chairman had the right to appeal to the National Committee of Rules and to request what was his right.
In an interview that took place prior to the appeal, Gabino Cué Monteagudos as Governor of the Federal State, he explained that Espino's exclusion was a decision that was taken at local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Sonora Committee of Rules of Procedure."
"Mr Espino has the right, in his case, to appeal to the Commission de Orden del Conseño Nacional to make a decision by a competent authority," he added.
On the other hand, he explained that it was not the time of 2012 and that an alliance for presidential candidates had never sat on the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Action Nacional emerged from the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor was elected.
"The (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the Community elections, he was successful and fulfilled his purpose," he said.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; on the contrary "we enjoy it and it strengthens us", he commented.
He said that the Council would no doubt choose the best president or president, the Action National for the next three years, so he handed over the letters "to those who would be appointed by the Council."
"I'm so worried and open. I'd be proud to transfer one of the five to the office of the chairman of the party."
He predicted that the party's rise in the last elections of 4 July would be reflected in the next elections, although "it's not the time to think about 2012."
"Now it is up to Governor Gabino Cué to support his task."
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would wear flags and be observed throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and desires will be placed in them and I am sure that Gabino is above the requirements."
When asked about the criticism of the PR by President Felipe Calderón because of his record course in his four-year government, César Nava called upon the PR to reflect on the six-year period of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should first defend them, they should finally come out of the closet," he confirmed.
He is of the opinion that the holder of the federal government's terms like those which he could make in his speech in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there was no oral prohibition and even less a censorship.
Obama applies to Twitter for the law for undocumented students
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, then call your senators and press for the adoption of this Act," the President of the United States tweeted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported national mobilization to support the Dream Act - laws for the legalization of undocumented students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, then call your senators and insist on the adoption of this law," Obama tweeted.
His brief statement contains a cyber link to a broader document that calls for the public to contact with its senators, as the vote of the law immediately preferred.
"With your voice that we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he stresses.
The message was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for each law, except for the extension of tax reductions from the time of Bush and the financing of the government.
Such a blockage, which was announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Regarding the blocking of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said he trusted that if the tax issue was resolved, a timetable for the other projects could be set up.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must have been resolved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement about it at any time and then we can plan the end of the rest," he said.
The president of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would ask for the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act, with which the initiative to legislate undocumented students could be approved from Thursday in the Senate, would be more likely next week.
The version of the Dream Act or the Law of the American Dream would legalize about 800 000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, while living in that country for the last five years and who were enrolled in a higher education institution or in the army.
But the lawyers of the law need to adopt the initiative sixty votes, which is why they are referring to the votes of a Republican with a full hand. At present, the organisations of the advocates of this project are organising an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of whom the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only a Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must have several Republicans on their side if other Democrats should decide to take the initiative back.
Among the most popular Republicans are Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they explained that they no longer supported it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had spoken up for the law, John McCain, has not yet determined his position.
Although the House of Representatives has another version, analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the greatest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust in the Language' was a walk where the participants made themselves strong for the story
"I understand that with the sex in the language, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was supposed to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lingua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish-speaking literature and used the subtitles of her question on this occasion (on another event the round table was dedicated to the sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us into trouble", the Argentine writer spoke out against the audience, which consisted mainly of young people who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, attended the Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and then marked the Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is on the lookout to learn what a "Wound" is, and goes to a doctor from which she does not receive an answer, but guidance for the guides of her story.
The infectors leave her convinced: "Gedulence is not my strength, perhaps it is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologists, who stole the breath in the middle of the walk, and who explained that Wonde was not a scientific concept, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "The wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main figure of the story makes it easier and concludes that she "only learned from the wound that it is really open and does not exist". But she is convinced that the lust in language and their cases mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a fascinating story he called 'Lob of invention', in which the finger is not mentioned in the wound, but is discovered.
He told of a famous magician who brought back the clouds, widely traveled men, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turning point and reported on America, the great novel that was not missing from its own chronicler from the beginning, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticised the flood of the stories told by the heroes.
"Cervantes, who introduced all of us (the writers), mocked the prettier witnesses who appeared in the true stories, but otherwise the story of America would never have been told - with the imagination that even came up with the shame."
However, he argues that "it is the crazy and liars who best imagine the things", and there reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows which side the story belongs where fiction reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the Tradition Cervantes.
"We inherited it from him to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was on the line, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the FIL had contributed to the round table 'The Finger in the Wound'.
The Cubans and Puerto Ricans devoted their contribution to the great wounds of social violence that their country - like Latin America as a result of the fights against drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, unplanned commitment," she explained, after pointing out that literature is communication and commitment that builds between the author and readers as with a "chemical reaction".
In the evening, Spanish poet Luis García Montero decided, whose contribution also highlighted "this finger of the committed writer in the wounds of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-paced world also intellectual habits and control of consciousness run out on dogmatisms, and is forgotten, "that behind every confirmation there is a little no and behind every lie a little yes."
"In order to be possessed of our thoughts and reality, we need to be nuanced: And nuances often meant to put the finger in the wound and to harass those who feel much better when they think in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in pre-made ideas without nuances, and also to harass the powerful who prefer to share the world in black and white, he observed and called for a sense of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced ups and abs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game, two different styles are compared to their respective trainers, and their encounter marked by opposites is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced ups and abs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has kept well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinian has played with the medal for the second champion, he is a step back behind the winners, and surprisingly he has played with the same team following the finals.
The Sanitary Strategy reached the first final game as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the bullets in his hand, with which he suffered a major defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', when they were playing against Los Diablos, Rubén had to re-introduce, as the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros went undecided after 210 minutes of play, but at the Elfmeter he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to paste his title, but finally three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned into a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore he does not want to be persecuted once again from the accident and free himself from the evil spell to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, that's for my affection, that's why the title will come to me, but what happened before is the most important thing," said the tax collector, when asked about the lost end games.
The last final game is still strong in his memory, he assures us to have learned much from it: "The only lesson we can learn from it is that until the divorce judge does not blow the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were prepared with two eleven meters on it, and I think that this is a lesson until the game is over, there is no reason to celebrate."
To know that this series could be decided by Elfmeter shooting, it does not bother him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to get to Elfmeter shooting, you want to close in the regular game time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately the fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the intense effort to keep the title in the hands that leaves us something for this final game, and we hope that this time will not come."
It is in Romanso's power not to be just the second champion and to spend the glory that the title brings with it for the first time.
The United States changes the rules for obtaining a visa
The persons must submit themselves to visa applications at the consulate before their consultation with the services; costs will be reduced so that waiting times will be reduced.
With effect from 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa will change in the message of the United States and in the consulates.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves before their consultation in the Consulate at the Visa Application Service Points (ASC), the initial letters in English.
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be verified by the consulate before the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirin, including:
The total cost of the settlement of the visa is reduced, as it is no longer necessary to pay separately the time-limits for the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is dealt with.
The applicant shall provide only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for Visa with request (including Visa for timers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who wish to extend their visas must not have a conversation in the consulate, they must only present themselves with the next ASC, where they will be presented and fingerprinted.
As biometric data are collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second date for the conversation in the consulate remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo must no longer pay the service charge of 26 dollars.
For further information on the new visa application procedure, see the following website: http://mexico.usebassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the fund of extraterrestrial life
The North American Space Agency launched a press conference to present a fund tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living beings in all.
The National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) of the United States will give tomorrow Thursday a known astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The Fund will be presented tomorrow at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts from astrobiology. It is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and the future of life in the universe.
At the opening of the press conference, NASA assured that it would present "a supervisory fund for the search for extraterrestrial life", which triggered speculation in experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that in hostile environments that have so far been considered uninhabitable, human creatures can exist. The hypothesis was suggested that they could transform into intelligent beings - as humans - if their living conditions improved.
It seems to be a microbe that was found on the basis of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that was considered too toxic for all forms of life thought to be because the lake is heavily arsenic.
In any way, the microbe uses the arsenic as a means of survival. Given this ability, there are increased chances that there may be a similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms change the arsenic, astrobiologists have shown that "there is actually another form of life, there is a second form of life that differs from the one we know."
The space agency will tomorrow, on Thursday, announce the actual scope of its fund at the press conference.
At the conference, geobiologists Pamela Conrad will take part in a study of the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (the largest moon Saturns) under the question of whether his chemical composition of the earth resembles it.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Pattern form an opposition block
With the reform of the organ law on Congress, the two-party system will be introduced, they complain.
The 60th legislative period had just begun, and an opposition block was already installed, led by the representatives of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalvo, who presented himself as an Independent. The four asked the following questions: the entry of the 'two-party system' into the chamber.
Before the opening of the session in the 60th legislative period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of PRD and Patron Montalvo of the reform of the organ law, as they would be excluded.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now there would be two people, the same number as the parties who controlled the Congress.
These four MPs, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the presidency of the Panista Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political position with these reforms.
He explained that in the next few days they would speak with representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme. In doing so, they went out of their political will, and if they did not have it, they would be disillusioned by both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"To this end I come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we will be excluded from all decisions that do not even look back to taking into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there were agreements with PRD, PT and Patron and that a pluralist group would therefore be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued that the Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be "duopolitic".
"It is not the spirit of the reform of the law that should rule a two-way system at the Congress."
"For the first time, this group starts with five Members and they talk to other colleagues to make them more," said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT introduced PAN and PRI that the Congress had now turned into a 'bate' for two.
"Before it was just a party, now they're sharing it to the second."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the MPs and assign their seats to the negotiating committees.
"It must not be left outside because of the top five decisions that are likely to be nine Members. The five that are currently seen as divided into different groups have decided to join in order to take our place on the negotiating table, because because because of the reform that has been carried out and committed by the others, we have stayed outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200,000 peso more for "the supplier"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays a further check to the contested owner of the company for electrical equipment.
Another check of more than 200 000 peso for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
This is the sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical equipment in the second half of the year, 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the site for more transparency of the city administration, this check was issued at an amount of 200,144,56 Peso with number 9258447 in the last 16 November with the purpose of using "Cumulative accounts".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent more money from the community to this supplier. It is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because it sells too much.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount you still owe and hence the number of checks that are still displayed in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"It wasn't bought at her, it's just paid the debts, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "appeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24th, two of October 15, October 19, October 29th and the last of November 16th.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as provided by law, when a company is questioned by the ASE in order to avoid other administrations applying for their services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be reclaimed.
After the Noroest newspaper had published the check issued by the City Administration to its suppliers on July 25th, it was announced that before, from March 2008 to July 9th 2010, during the three-year term of office of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also businesses with Jumapam, where they took cheques worth over 3 million peso.
Tourist sites need to be improved urgently
Tourist companies regret the accident of foreign tourists due to the poor condition of the Gloriata Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
Following the storm of a foreign tourist in the collapse of the Glorieta Sánchez Tabooda, the tourist industry of Mazatlán requested special attention from the authorities, the areas in which they were in bad shape and a bad image to the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the trade union of the Zone Dorada, recalled that there were different opportunities to maintain the destination and to turn the bad conditions of tourists into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad condition of the roads and roads had had a negative effect, as the tourists came to wander and saw the disorder, which would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means to have to close a company one day and they don't think about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't do the construction work in this way slowly and planlessly."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the storm of the tourist would have paid attention to the lack of prevention and the remaining maintenance work on the part of the city.
"The community has to take over its responsibility and avoid something like this once again. How should it do this? Well, through a preventive maintenance instead of improving everything in the background," he explained.
"We look forward to having a clean city. Not only because it is a foreign transport area, it must be maintained, we also have a right to a clean living space. The city administration must change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unappreciated and incomplete," he said, "for example el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. It must be offered a good product, a city that cleans its beaches and streets, and the tourist attractions keep on shooting," he added.
"These provisions have not been given enough attention and these kinds of incidents simply make what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Promoción Turistica, expressed how important it was to save the tourist places of Mazatlán because they would not be properly used and made a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that should be brought together with the city to Vördermann. The city should be privileged to form clean, orderly and attractive for foreign transport.
"Happyly, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that first need to be cleaned and cleaned to make them attractive for foreign transport and to provide them with the inventory we purchase for this destination.
IP Demands Congress Results
Mr Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, suggested that the Members should take on the great responsibility of providing a model for a better Sinaloa, which is facing many challenges.
The company sector of Mazatlán calls for a decent Parliament, free of agreement with the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is exhausted and is facing major problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was dedicated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergence and another of PVEM.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, feel obliged to the society and the various social groups, which are responsible for parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same pattern of participation and patriotism.
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE Business Coordination Council, proposed that the new Members should take on the great responsibility of providing a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that the Members will really exercise their right to act free of disagreements between the parties, because it is common for them to enter into agreements with which they represent their own interests, thus transforming themselves into carnival compatriots of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should prove their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We are concerned that they do a credible work and make use of all things for society and their groups, because it was the people of Sinaloa who spoke to them about their trust in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges facing 40 peoples is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in some way promote job creation."
With regard to the foreign transport sector, he called on the new Members to give the necessary value in the State budget to encourage the Ministry of Foreign Transport.
"I understand that it is the Ministry with the two most important funds, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign currency and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
The tourist projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been reintroduced in previous legislative periods, needs to be brought to the forefront.
Sacred King Seeking
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family wish to have their own toys, cars, bicycles and other toys.
It will be difficult for parents to meet these wishes on the next Tuesday, because the budget is no longer composed of 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toy and the clothes that they wear.
The family inhabits a modest house in the village of Salvador Allende. They live by hand in the mouth, because the father has no hard work.
"Sometimes hard times have been said because my husband doesn't have a job. But we're selling mandarins and potatoes... I'm going to the street with the gorges in the afternoon," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo has been wanting to have a 'monster car' for some time, and for his eight-month-old brothers Jesus proposes Cayetana dress in size for one-year-olds.
" (José Alfredo) said to me, 'I would love this monster so much', but I replied to him, 'Let us wait, boy', for it was very expensive," recalled Cayeta sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has the size of 12; the ten-year-old Isaiah has the size of 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel has the size of 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A couple in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King Is sought' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 oral drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, during the collapse of a cannabis production and sales network, ten household investigations were carried out in the Esteria region.
Fourteen persons have been arrested and various charges are being brought.
The household investigations took place in Sherbrooke, Orford, and Stoke, where they were supposed to have served mainly in the manufacture of drugs.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of Haschisch, cash and equipment that have served the production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson of the Quebec security police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, of whom two men, who were considered the main drug addict, came from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons are to be released in Sherbrooke for hours after their arrest before the court building.
They could, among other things, be charged with the production of cannabis, the possession of which for sale, the plot and the service of crime.
These household investigations had resulted in a long-term investigation activity that had been reimbursed for over a year.
"The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," explained Mr. Ruel.
The 70 police officers of the regional intelligence unit Estries of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Office had participated in this police operation.
The secret migration could be pursued without any problem
The draft legislation of the Conservatives, which, according to the Government, is to deal with the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, will be suppressed in the light of all expectations, after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I am renouncing this charter."
"I am with a party that has put you on foot," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus meeting in front of the assembly.
The Liberals claimed to maintain the draft legislation allowing any person who is identified as an illegal immigrant to hold a vessel for up to one year, as proposed, to violate the Canadian law and freedom constitution.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québecis, also indicated that he could not support the bill as he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will expect what the government is doing," said Mr Duceppe.
The criticism of the immigration question by Olivia Chow, NDP, has shown the critics by hand, who demand that their party not stand firm enough against secret immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and we are just trying to implement another bill, C-35," Chow said.
Therefore, we do not support the draft legislation of the Conservatives because he is looking for the debt of refugees and keeps children trapped for at least a year," Chow explained.
Minister of Immigration Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The Canadians strongly tell the MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal proceedings involving Canada and treating the country as a legionnaire."
"You expect Canada to take hard action," said Minister Kenneys.
"The government has not announced any confidence in its draft legislation which could have led the country to elections that rejected the government.
A conservative, however, has spoken to the QMI agency, the government would call for a vote so that any opposition MPs would immediately make themselves known to his electors.
The new unit does not find any unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, standing unit to fight corruption and collapse by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public committee to investigate this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has been in possession of a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
However, the announcement of Wednesday has more than one surprise.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed at the least at the meeting of the Permanent Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils.
It was also not missing that Stéphane Bergeron, critics and member of the Québec party, qualified this announcement in public security at the point as "sweet rabbit" as well as "a dish-based solution".
On the other hand, Minister Dutil had turned to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the inquiring, future unity.
"You will see the result when we announce it," he used to confirm himself.
"You are aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr Charest insists on preventing the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only means to be able to form a committee of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political systems at the ENA (State University for the Training of High Administrative Officers).
In order to get out of this bag gas, he proposes that the Quebec financial audit should establish a special mandate to enable it to conduct investigations related to corruption and secret agreements.
"You should be able to extend the mandate of the inspection control," he decided.
He is also of the opinion that the Quebec of the inspection control could have the same power as Commissioners, which you would allow to oblige people to make a statement.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the Government's Chairs of Charest.
The Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the criminal law there in order to be better set up in this kind of crime.
This request comes from the Supreme Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case in this kind of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed on his part, his colleague by the Justice, Rob Nicholson, that he is currently dealing with certain novelties relating to this dossier.
During the 2001 Operation Printtemps, which affected the gangs of the motorcycle police, 131 persons were arrested, although the criminal law had not been renewed.
As a result, Ottawa has passed the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several rivers remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfalls that have taken place since Tuesday in some regions of the province.
In Shawinigan, in the Maurice administrative region, it came to an earthquake on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening another earthquake occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has fallen into it.
From Tuesday to Wednesday, strong rainfalls ranged from 40 to 70 millilitres of rainfall in several regions.
Between 20 and 40 additional millimetres of precipitation were expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
In total, up to 100 millimetres of rain shows have gone down here.
Since these rainfalls are still to be taken up by the snowmalt that has already been collected in certain sub-areas, the breach of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued warnings about the high-water alarm concerning the Ouereau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudier region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentian mountains and the Chene in Lotbinière will continue to be the object of high water monitoring.
In the Lanaudière region, the severe defeats of some lakes in Sainte-Julianne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, and Rawdon, have led to their defeat.
In Saint-Calixte, a bridge was extended due to heavy rainfalls.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the breach of certain lakes caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Security Service continues to be in alert and is monitoring the situation as described by security advisor Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec Landeshochwater Centre issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular of Maskinongé, Assamption, Oueau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont is partly authorised
The Quebec Radio Moderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial relapse before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Radio Standards (CCNR) due to his controversial statements about social security and Haitians as well as his outstanding speech about Funk.
Although the CCNR represented the opinion, M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to their own opinion, certain statements had "inaccurate information about social security and unfairly negative representations of the Haitians, as well as an unparalleled speech that is not appropriate for the daily broadcasts."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion on suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide violates the codex of radio broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made during the broadcasts in 2008 and 2010.
The first available was submitted in response to a complaint from the "Front commune des persons assistees sociales du Québec".
The Activist organisation complained that the amounts mentioned in the consignment were inadequate.
The moderators should provide more solid information than misleading information.
As for the topic of suicide, Moderator Stéphane Dupont had represented the opinion that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the supervisory board members had concluded that the message mediated was that suicide should not be regarded as a solution to life’s crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the consequences of the dupont le midi mission in question would have cut off a sensitive issue in a familylike and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was exposed with no sign of his person.
The last point of dispute concerned the statements concerning the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had been involved in an effective media debate in this regard, which resulted in a number of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had explained not to have spent in favour of Haiti's aid, as one did not know for sure whether the needy would actually receive the money.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that these comments have not been abusive in character, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already abolished my three-day suspension penalty in this case."
"My file has been youthful for half a year," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Board of Supervisors calls for the dissemination of an unresolved expression.
In any case, the CHOI-FM broadcaster has acted "on the other hand of his obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, which, inter alia, was to communicate his decisions on a case-by-case basis within a three-day period, are minor.
King of the King-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montreal of Algeria, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, which shines in "sanda" (full contact with King-Fu), kickboxes and Thaiboxes, is now looking for new challenges to the Tami and to the world's boxing rings.
"I started 12 years ago in Algeria with fighting sports such as kung fu and kickboxes," Zemmal, who has been in the metropolis since 2008 to develop under the profession.
I personally seek to avoid the fight, because for those who do not like the ground fight, as presented by the mixed arts, the struggles in North America are rare."
Recently, his sign as a security officer, as well as his rivals at UPS, had given out bad news in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate as well as the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the world championship held between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won the victory in the categories of full-contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
"Now I'm preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China."
"It was those fighters from every category who had been placed in the last World Cup under the first four."
"My baby was picked up in Toronto Bronze in 2009."
"2005 I became behind in Vietnam."
"2007 I finished the tournament in China in fifth place, while I became third in 2009 in Toronto," he added.
"It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm, I will be the first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating in China, where foot-and-mouth strokes and footpaths are allowed as well as ground designs.
The twins usually play on a platform, less rare in a boxing ring.
The most famous box fighter that has emerged from this kind of battle sport is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, which is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal had to keep only one event in his career, he would surely be here to call his presence at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the King-Fu.
"This competition is the highest and most respected in China," said the sympathetic guitar.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest Thai Stadium)."
"That was a great experience."
In the semifinal of his category (80kg) he won his first battle before he lost in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four rivals per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals meet each other in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer the stage to crown a single champion, the king of the King-Fu."
450 million in contracts without tendering
In mutual agreement, Hydro-Quebec has approved project planning companies $450 million of contracts for the water power project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the middle of this Lawine of more than 100 contracts, a consortium consisting of companies BPR, Dessau, SM and Axor, which received the most important share, namely the project management, to a sum of $295 million without tender.
This consortium, called "Energie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a sponsor of the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector's responsibility to respond to this important hydroelectric project in the amount of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Energie gérance" concluded the contract without a public tender.
For the Québec party, the withdrawal of companies' consortia poses a serious ethical problem that undermines the risk of distortion of competition and an increase in prices.
"This is a new way of playing a carded game and distorts competition."
"This means that instead of playing carded games instead of secretly, you are now running in open form," yesterday, Silvain Simard, the PQ MP, explained at the press conference.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, as it seems difficult for him to understand how the public interest can be handled in this way.
Minister of Resources Nathalie Normandeau had responded to this in the afternoon by claiming that this treaty had been a de-marcated game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she said, by strengthening the PQ's "unfairly" and "missing her hard".
She said "it's the least", that the PQ apologized.
The model of the consortium is a global practice.
It is usually a temporary alliance which allows two or more companies to combine their expertise in a bid for a complex project.
The Eastmain project shows a high level of complexity in terms of its scope.
The construction process is in progress and is scheduled to be set up by 2012.
However, the contract was granted without a competition competition; there had already been negotiations.
Moreover, the model of the consortium in Quebec itself is no longer an exception in relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" last week noted, the model applied in the field of engineering and consulting is the subject of government notices by the consortium.
A short flight from the Quebec Company Register allows for more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any connection, and there are several dozen of it, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As regards the consortium "Energie gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Bay of James is subject to special labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has paid this fact in a special way since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the great employer of Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that the nose over the fact that the contract on project management has been approved after agreement.
"If you make an invitation to tender and there are only a few applicants, your prices will be faster."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this march and tell you: you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea is, however, that the price is not crucial, but the understanding of the people," Laporte confirmed.
This contract granted to the consortium "Energie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50,000 dollars received from the Québec Party.
The contracts were either approved by the Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the review, the newspaper Le Devoir included more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts, companies or their branches, including in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had entered into 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without including their participation in "Energie gérance".
All these treaties have been negotiated.
They total $449 783 344, including the contract with "Energie gérance" over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had announced that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) of the "Parti liberal du Québec are well known".
Minister Normandeau had made allegations that the PQ was equally linked to the companies that they "funded" before she stated that it was rather about their leadership.
Barometer Aware of Consumers - The "green" label is not trusted
Greener, but unscrupulous skeptic.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main players of sustainable growth, but also little in the marked brands or eco-labels to control its choice.
Unfortunately, although it is in a media-efficient universe where information for a more responsible consumer is only so clouded: the barometer responsible consumer has a lack of credible information to complain about, an insufficiency that makes itself known as a brake of its commitment, as the first reading showed, which was held yesterday.
Although they have advanced the consumption of the so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to pay little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of Quebec's population contribute to the environmental commitment of companies as little faith as the green company advertising, so the measuring instrument, which is the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke, betrays.
Another finding is that half of consumers have doubts about the reliability of the official certificates added to the probably fair products, but also about the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves to be environmentally conscious, says the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the speech of politicians on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumption segment, which is currently living with only about one third of Quebec's consumers.
In fact, empty and doubtful characters of the information drowned the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer at the higher price of the products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers are disappointed at the stated performance of green products and services which they are trying to afford.
According to another Communication, over half of consumers in 2010 had changed their habits and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their convictions.
According to Barometer, they also preferred 61% purchases to traders in their city district and favoured the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmental consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the homo consumption of Quebec likes to present itself as a king of recycling, who tries to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of animal protection.
However, the social and environmental consciousness seems to be stopping in front of his car, so the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have indicated, using public transport in 2010, or prefering the accompanying centre to demonstrate their environmental interest.
The follow-up and the cycle were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which feed on the cliché ideas.
State bonds for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which was invited by Société Angus and the company Parallele to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agrees with cooperation, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The development company Angus and the company Parallelle, which had hoped to receive a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture for the acquisition of Daniel Langlois's cinema complex eXcentris at the Boulevard Saint-Laurent to responsibly respond to his actual cinematic function, obviously did not receive what they requested.
The Government has accepted to involve itself in this matter, however, on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government offers a loan of less than the initially expected amount that could provide an existing solution to favourable living conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources taken from the public kitchens.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec in the last spring, the request for a petition has been remedied to the bottom.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent by the President of Société de development des entreprises culturalles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who runs the eXcentris Act.
A few days ago, he had her get a final report.
However, the counter-proposal of the cabinet was sent to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallels and Angus now have until 31 December time to respond to these.
In any case, the awards of the state funds seem to have really been pushed aside.
Let us remember that the Quebec Ownership Community of the cinemas and cinema complexes had relied on a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by providing the argument that the Minister of Culture had no financial aid for real estate projects there which he did not allow to come to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained of substantial economic aid.
After the self-funded design of the cinema, film director Daniel Langlois had presented the author cinema with great difficulties in the space of his cinema complex for over ten years, which could justify the exception of the state treasure.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his clients at the stake.
The Société Angus and the company Parallele with Christian Yaccarini at the top, are directing a privately funded campaign, from which they expect a sum of $700,000 in order to curve the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only a single canvas wall has continued to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallele.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three cinema halls on 27 February next year with the performance of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux" again.
But Christian Yaccarini has not called the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group hold from the suggestions corrected below that have been made to them.
Canada's Secret of Complexly Protected Air
The new American diplomats, which were distributed by WikiLeaks, secreted what the United Nations thought under the Canadian minority complex against the Americans; but with the same blow, they reveal the feeling of superiority over Canada.
As a result, American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian electorate does not have the Canadian-American relations in mind at the election, and they believe that President Obama's visit would have helped the conservative government to implement its 2009 budget!
The four new messages between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, offer even more pique details than the only substantial content to be found.
A connection dating from 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period during which the federal election campaign was in full range, reports on the extent to which the United Nations no longer participates in the policies discussed by its political boss.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, the American ambassador employed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
"A Canadian near-inhabited minority complex may require Canadian political leaders to talk much more about internal issues of everyday life than to assign the black Peter (as in the campaign on free trade in 1988) to the United States in this election," he describes.
The United Nations, as he concludes, is therefore "the literal Goliath of this choice: omnipresent but potentially too dangerous to speak of him".
The ambassador understands this "stupid silence" even less, as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"In a logical way," he said, "it seemed to be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the elector has in mind as a key factor in the rush."
The other expression of this feeling of importance was read in the announcement sent by Terry Breese, a businessman in Ottawa on 22 January 2009, that President Barack Obama should prepare for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure that the Government continues to exist in the vote of confidence over the federal budget at the beginning of February, when Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which is due to a survival programme of between 30 and 40 billion dollars," Breesee describes.
There was no mention of the fact that the government had to attend the parliamentary meeting before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from falling apart from the coalition and that the continued existence of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed compliance programme.
A further message written by Ambassador Wilkins from January 2008 understands Washington's increasingly negative image that the CBC broadcasts dramatic series from the United States.
The Ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle performances on Maher Arar, the "No-Fly List" or also performances for the purpose of the CIA's muscle prosthetics.
Another communication reports in detail how Hillary Clinten asked his French official Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting to see if Europe was ready to take certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual 'fall to case' decision.
At the end of the meeting, it was described as "he handed out a paper to the State Secretary at Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Canadian Muslim."
"The Secretary of State has promised to review the file again."
Finally, we note that the hosts are warming up with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper's very close advisor, had explained about CBC that those responsible for this massive Leck should be "introduced".
He referred here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global plan for the renewal of lighting
Yesterday in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to re-enlighten households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (FCKW), which corresponds to nearly one third of the additional reductions that need to be implemented in order to stabilise the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan adopts its position in the course of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction obligations of industrial countries.
According to yesterday's plan, the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the FCKW released on earth would be avoided if the white-lighted beers, which still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better, by LEDs.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the global fleet's exhaust gas.
Last year in Copenhagen, the major gas stationers such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, were committed to voluntary reduction plans, which should be downgraded by global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 gt had to be withdrawn from this balance sheet in order to stabilise the rise in climate by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020 in order to prevent this out of control.
In the white-swirl berry, 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact light bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED light bulbs it is reduced again by twice.
The compact light bulbs hold an average of 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those that the manufacturer Philips placed on the market this week - this company has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-lighted bear, which makes it possible to exploit the savings of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that it gives only very little heat to completely new bulbs, it can also work with a regulatory resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact light bulbs have reserves, as they contain mercury and therefore need to be disposed of as a special waste, which is not always possible in the developing countries, except for producers provide an adoption site.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, is not the compact light source, but rather the coal plants that emit significantly more mercury in order to generate the electricity emitted by the white glowing bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report sets out in detail the gains that each country would generate through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars annually when purchasing electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal plants, whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire expects the announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential election of the Côte d'Ivoire immediately after their deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to receive its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay," said a UN chief press speaker.
"He requests all parties and institutions of the Côte d'Ivoire to demonstrate their responsibilities and to include each initiative until the publication of the provisional results."
Despite the pressure from certain foreign governments, the Commission had allowed the deadline set on Wednesday afternoon to be extended three days after the Sunday election, without publication of the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI on TV confirmed that the Commission would "go on with the work" in order to announce the results.
On Wednesday many calls from all over the world have been heard, but the CEI can finally call out the name of the winner of the second round of elections under the position of Laurent Gbagbo and his opponents Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo warehouse is counting on the cancellation of "misleading" voting fees in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the former Rebel camp of the Forces nouves (UN) during the coup that failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Presidential Campaign of the Côte d'Ivoire, confirmed that the United Nations-led manoeuvre to frighten voters in the north of the country had scared the President's supporters of the election.
The entire election could be annulled if the appeals brought by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo counterparties are now more of the view that the highest court in the country is not neutral, since it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely connected with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the north who disputes each connection to the former rebels, has judged the delay in announcing the election results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he had not gone so far to call for victory.
Confirming its allies, Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results, since he knew that he had lost; and bringing a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the electoral commission from publishing the results, that is illegal.
The second round of the Presidential elections on Sunday was held to mark the unification and reconciliation process of a country, which was split into two parts over years.
The United Nations had warned the policymakers of the Côte d'Ivoire on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for any outbreaks.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round of elections on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who was behind the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
In the sense of the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolis, the unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), the provisional seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office of Insee show.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is 2,631 million.
The figures for the second quarter were 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% of the working population in the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate showed an increase of 0.1 percentage points.
At the same time, 3.4 million employees of the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter, but wanted to find a job, including whether they were able to work every two weeks or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has worsened with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points per year) and 25% with the involvement of the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed.
On the other hand, seniors have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of over 50-year-olds, 6.6% including the overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 years could benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage point over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
Following a dispute over its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
However, Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, continues in this method and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including overseas departments) compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
Against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a relief company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), an investigation procedure was initiated and he was sent to Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence during a public and suspected investigation procedure.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of undermining the assets of society, reversion of general property, herory, partnership in corruption, illegal occupation and possession of weapons, as his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is preparing for the fight and intends to express himself on all the questions that will be put to him by the State's attorney rather than by the Herringspinte."
"It is easy for him to submit a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them," said his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agency France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti Socialist) in the department, had put the judge in charge of bringing a memorandum to his jurisdiction before his hearing by his lawyers.
A member of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also accused and arrested on Wednesday.
According to Lawyer Lucien Simon, her mandate had never done anything other than keep his deposit that he had to run.
As for the business competence area or destination of the associated fund, he would never have known, as Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Aubagne Ballroom, was also charged on Wednesday for subjugation and complicity, but under the obligation to remain free under judicial supervision from the protagonists of these acts.
"My mandate was able to provide explanations of the facts that were presented to him."
"The head of state attorney took into account not to rob him of his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were charged and were released on Wednesday night from prison, including two of them under legal supervision, as deputy state attorney Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director of the disposal company Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is prosecuted for "unauthorized influence and passive interference".
Two state officials of the Aubagne Ballroom, Michèle Duval and Christophe Briguier, were also arrested, who were arrested for the title "Retirement and Retirement of General Goods by an officer of the Public Service", the other for "Mitness in Retirement of Public Money".
The lifelong companion of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with the "Healing and subjugation of Society's assets".
Among the people who were confronted by Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently arrested for a similar case of fraud involving Corsica.
The prisoners suspect his society to have contributed to washing money from "high" criminal circles.
In April 2009, the investigation against X on the grounds of undue fraud in the award of public contracts, particularly in the area of disposal, will lead to anonymity in the records of several open investigation procedures.
From close sources, it is noted that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the grant and the operation of a depot in La Ciotat, which is also waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities in the urban area of Marseille (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exceeds its central function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was held in Iran due to "spionage", the French public in spirit, moved the diplomacy into alert and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
This is all under the attention of the United States diplomats.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and screened by the newspaper "Le Monde" give some of the reasons for this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained to the Americans its strategy, which went so far as to give these advice to deal with their own crisis of "commitments" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They point out how the French officials have tried to convince Washington that the release of young French people does not benefit from the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner in France and US justice, because of trade in materials for the benefit of Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they set out the way in which the French presidency tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making this idea credible, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, in a great light.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic telegram, edited on 12 August 2009, in Paris, bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostages".
François Richier, Elysée-advisor on strategic issues, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, Director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They urged the Americans to put everything in order to withdraw their own nationals who would be held violent in Iran.
"Power noise," they said, "articulated loud and clear and without neglect" the words "basic human rights", "unsculled", "fast release" in the media.
This is necessary to bring the Iranian regime into disrepute, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this more, especially ask the Iranians not to do this."
Because "Stolen solves nothing", past the discussion attempts on infallible ways, the Iranians are "masters in exchange controls".
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was a "conventional, Iranian tactics": "accommodation for the purpose of political repression".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was due on 16 August, on the day she fled to the French Embassy) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (23,000 euros).
And he lets it be said that the Elysée anticipates other ghosts, a phenomenon that will "strengthen me".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens who live in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago, but remains in Iran.
An information was transmitted: Iran's Majid Kakavand, whose delivery to Iran was requested by the United States due to illegal trafficking in sensitive electronic material, was released after a judge's decision in Paris.
The American message is like many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence.
The release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news for Washington, who is pursuing the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the nuclear programme.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The liberation of Iran from the French?
On 4 September, after a resurgence with Kathleen Allegrone, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, as he says, was not only "fully surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to rely on it.
"There has been a real exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (now Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the ruling," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand is still under "strict" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée consultant selects a telephone number, re-sends, so informs the American diplomat, Iran's "currently located in the buildings led by the Iranian Embassy in Paris".
During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not appreciate his efforts to make use of rumors and the media of organized "flight trials", the Syrian President Bakhar Al-Assad plays a "significant" and "influenced middle role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 states "the media flash of the French authorities".
On what is so much "thank you" based with Mr Assad, the Paris Embassy is asking.
"Despite their complimentary statements, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to fall into this fiction.
He analyses the intensive communication efforts "to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria", he analyzes.
A 2008 policy was launched, which was "recognised by numerous critics in France and abroad as early and undeserved".
"The Syrian role building up" tries Paris "to lead Syria before the eyes of what praise can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "seek peace between Syria and Iran".
The American message knows this from a good source.
On August 11th, François Richier trusted her: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians have ever done anything."
"But in spite of all this, we thank them."
"This should at least create confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the free movement of our countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans by midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called "the Ashkenbrüdel", which will prohibit young people from playing after midnight online games by blocking their access, as stated by government officials.
A bill to encourage online gambling operators to refuse access to these games under 16 years of age after midnight will be presented to Parliament in December, represented by representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family.
"Many children play these games all night long and thus have difficulties with learning in school and also to lead a normal life throughout the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, with this draft of legislation, a trusted ministerial agent of the French press agency Agency France Presse.
The online games will then be available again from 6 a.m.
The companies had a long time to prepare for the application of the law, as he pointed out.
The government also looks forward to asking the manufacturers to make time-limits for access to these games, with the young people whose parents ask for it, added the responsibility.
He will also provide free programs to those who wish to provide them, which will allow them to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and the newspapers regularly report on various, intensive Internet-related events.
The country is also an unrestrained champion in online game competitions worldwide.
In November, over 58 other nations won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games.
World Championship 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the Country of Director
The FIFA Executive Committee will be very excited about corruption on Thursday, 2018 and 2022, with the highest political choice in which the range of influence and lobbying threaten the technical criteria in the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA's Royal Discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional Hochburg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then become somewhat more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (catar, Australia) for itself after the 2010 premiere on the African continent, or to continue to pursue its descent in the United States or in Fernost (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Heads of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measure of the economic and political use of a world championship.
Thus, the techniques behind the scenes threaten to continue until the last minute.
Otherwise, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy of the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portugal (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was held at the beginning of the revelations, with the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could also have ruined the chances for their own country, the balance of the football, which could only one time bring the world championship to austere, namely 1966.
The BBC had once again given the nutrient floor on Monday by issuing a documentary report, which took over three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to upset the FIFA and bring the English leaders into disrepute, who, in the first place, had engaged David Cameron in intensive lobbying these last weeks.
The Head of Government hopes for a relaunch of the strike by his predecessor, Tony Blair, which in 2005 had achieved the organization of the 2012 Olympic Games for London.
Would this intensive use be sufficient to re-evaluate the image of England before the Committee?
Nothing is less secure, because the Duo Spain-Portugal is not lacking in drumming with its already finished stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, the Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the economic and financial shadow sides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the Solvency of Spain and Portugal increase the chances of Russia, which, despite its gaps in the folder (stations, hotels, transport), has become a major outside.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to impose the undue emphasis on the views of the English press "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" since the committee members.
"You're pushing her with shit, you're trying to compromise her," Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seemed to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, seat of FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages towards Japan and South Korea, which have developed a very beautiful project separately.
However, these new candidates seem to be early for two countries that had organised the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the approval by FIFA of WM 2026 for China, which will allow the Asian opportunities to be reduced to 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had brought all the registers with the expectation of futuristic stages, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries are a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the lack of television rights (due to the shift in time) of the sensitive nervousness of FIFA.
Second mandate: transparency
The Gaulle had really supported.
The morning had made him think he'd cut.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than this.
A mandate in Elysée calls the next one.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the openness is not well-founded by the mystery of the Presidency function.
So you have to do it as if the doubt existed fort.
In one, as in the other sense.
In 2006, the followers of Jacques Chiracs submitted that a third mandate was not excluded without believing in it themselves.
On November 15th, Nicolas Sarkozy assured to make his decision "sometimes in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that he would make the perspective of "two mandates" appear in the Elysée before the UMP parliamentarians on Tuesday evening had therefore spread a little flexicurity.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
Not enough.
The President only recalled that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year term of office to only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentions the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humourful tone.
"You've been with me for seven and a half years, or at best," he explained to them in July 2009.
A new one in May 2010: "Don't believe I don't think about the phase after that."
His words of yesterday no longer make him a candidate than the day before; but not less.
If they make comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidate with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the recording of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which Nicolas Sarkozy is driving to reveal itself.
On the contrary, it is its apparent candidacy in 2012, which reminds many members of the PS earlier than accepted to fight.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer a candidature by François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46%) versus 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey.
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion with the UMP," the Prime Minister responded immediately and cautiously.
"If he were to find a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe in being able to win," corrects Alain Juppe, who has fallen into the trap of openness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to retain its acquisitions of state paper
The last assembly of the ECB's Central Bank's central bank last year should offer opportunities to identify how to emerge from the crisis, or at least to announce a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be completed by the end of the year.
The European public debt crisis requires that the Central Bank in Frankfurt can no doubt bring about the current, more tense situation on European bond markets, in order not to cause them to deteriorate.
The political costs would be too high.
On the occasion of a press conference yesterday, the French Minister for Finance Christine Lagarde welcomed the active role of the ECB in resolving the budgetary debt of Europe.
She did not dare to say whether she felt that the Central Bank could do more, for example by charging her program of purchases of State bonds.
"I keep my thoughts before my European trading partners (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB in Brussels on the occasion of his hearing with the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee, did not show much interest in his plans, but rather agreed to point out that the programme of purchases of state-owned paper on the secondary market would be "broadcast" and that we will "see how the decisions are made" at the Thursday meeting.
Only certainty: The ECB will make its leadership unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the bond purchases of the Treasury Chamber were doubled from the ECB last week to about 1.35 billion euros.
And according to the indications of some traders, they were to have made new purchases on Irish and Portuguese state papers yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have purchased 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among the traders, the anticipation of a follow-up of the purchase course is no doubt at all (see page 29).
The public authorities are no longer expecting any significant change in the course.
If the lending operations have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal for more than three months, the latter will be made available to the unlimited reserves of funds over a period of one week to three months.
The public authorities are already insisting that this measure will be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine that the ECB will change its programme in a significant way."
"If not, she would take the risk of provoke new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, Volkswirt of the Commerzbank.
"A progressive climb seems more likely to me for the course of the first quarter of 2011," says Norbert Brams, Volkswirt at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of their interventions on the public debt market, "the ECB has been able to maintain such a volume of purchases of bonds that are living on the market," Norbert Brams adds.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the euro area debt markets, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must come to any price to the sellers of the missing investors on the market and act in such a way as to prevent the early enthusiasm for the income paid to the weakest states," a key bond holder testified yesterday.
For if interest rates were to be applied to the flight, the States would be even more prevented from reducing their debt or only stabilizing it.
This is the price for protecting the euro.
The government of Berlusconi goes to Italy to cover
After a week of concern for Italy, yesterday, the situation with the fall in peaks for 10 years has been somewhat relaxed.
A return to the sadnessy silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the regional president Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "un quantifiable" and had heard him with a "unpredictable" weekend, which the person concerned immediately demented.
In any case, on Tuesday, the share of the German interest rates would have reached its 210 basis points record, and the prices of the contracts covering the competition risk increased to 263 points, which had resulted in a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi pointed out to his Council of Ministers that the difference between Spain and the German interest rates was at 400 basis points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, however, had expressed itself as "seriously concerned" by the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of ignition from the direction of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third national economy of the Eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, Volkswirt at Hudson Institute.
In Putuxt, that is, his problem is the absence of economic growth and the resulting, sudden, tax revenue that threatens the State is no longer able to cover its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012 is expected, although the budget for the Senate is estimated to be 1.3%, respectively.
Under these conditions, as calculated by the EU Commission, the budget deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (in contrast to the government forecast of 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
That is why the call for a new budget collection, which could be used after the holidays for a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new savings must be taken," says economic examiner Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The basic feasts of the Italian economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time," assures Arigo Sadun, Italian trustees of the International Monetary Fund, which is entrusted to the IMF with Italy.
"At the moment, there are no problems, either in the short term or in the long term, as in spite of Italy's high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.D.R.) there are fewer stabilization progress than in other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, the OECD chief of the population.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of opposition from the Chamber of Deputies, which could be organised at the end of March.
So there is a little time before a decision on a serious crisis is taken.
Europeans are thinking about the expansion of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde pointed out yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I believe it has been demonstrated on Sunday afternoon and evening: Europeans are clearly united, ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency."
Although it is quite relative - the deduction mentioned yesterday at European State bonds' interest rates was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, from the beginning of normalization, this cannot be the case.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced, it could lower the debt mark of Portugal, which is probably the most effective target disc of the speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political credibility which is particularly dependent on banking systems," said the opinion of the peoples of Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, especially "political time is much slower than market time".
The European countries, which are aware of both this scourge and the danger they are hiding in, are intensifying the discussions to strengthen the anti-crisis measures already in place.
The informal consultations between the finance ministers directly concerned and in the further direction with their G20 counterparts are going well.
This is also true of Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan sets out the breakdown of the unconventional measures to strengthen the euro area countries in the front of the market (see below).
As regards the EU Stability Fund, its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, has already started his Asia tour on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors in Fernost about developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not expressive fundraising, he will certainly prepare the ground for this.
The first advertising expenditure from the EU Stability Fund is foreseen for the next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative of the Reuters Agency had trusted that the United States supported a possible increase in the fund mobilised by the IMF’s additional direct commitment.
Portugal and Spain, first of all, are asking for structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organization.
Reforms that are needed to achieve savings, however, should show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid have gone a different way than this Greece and Ireland have done.
Both the one and the other are at any price to avoid having to ask for international aid before they have set up their own budget corrections and decided on non-necessary structural reforms, which will bring them back to life.
In turn, European capital donors are concerned about the options available to accelerate the process of normalising the markets of State bonds.
Axel Weber, who was on his trip to Paris on November 24th, had the first idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take it back into its own pocket.
The shareholders of Barclays Capital, with regard to the European public debt market as a whole, decide that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity spray.
This resource exists: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
A council which has every chance of being examined carefully in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are concerned.
Snow and ice cream: 24 departments in Orange
The snow episodes continue to cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now at the alarm level of Orange due to the threat of snow and ice risk.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne are the 20 departments already in the Orane alarm level; 18 since midnight and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snowshoes stretch the north of the Gironde and the Charentes, it cuts slightly on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow cover is expected from 2 to 5 cm, i.e. also from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are considerable enough to cause traffic congestion and to affect certain economic activities, says Météo France.
In the region of Côtes d'Armor, several regional roads are blocked for heavy traffic of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The traffic situation of the secondary traffic networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic policymen who have stopped using their own vehicle only in the event of an emergency, and the use of some TER buses has been deleted all day long.
In Picardie, school traffic was cancelled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for in the Wednesday.
The prefecture "requires the drivers to be careful on the streets and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) invited airlines to delete 25% of them from Paris Roissy airport on Thursday and 10% of Orly's starting flights due to the expected strong snowfalls.
The DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airports in southern London and the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport economy on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it is estimated at billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris to be built by Société du Grand Paris is to be recalled.
In order to lead the construction of the SGP into the way, the State has raised a capital allocation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would allow the SGP to give to the markets part of the financial sum twice.
Today it has finally come to first calculations.
The 2010 supplementary budget, which is to be adopted this morning by the Financial Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures provided for in order to raise the first part of the funds.
This is a two-way approach: the creation of a special tax on discharge and higher taxation of offices in Ile-de France.
First of all, Article 15 of the draft law is adopted, "to the benefit of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris".
This is stated: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
Secondly, a reorganization of the existing corporate tax system is "to modernise it to increase it from its resulting product and to respond to this increase in Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
A puzzle.
This sum is not specified in the text.
From the 4 billion you're far away.
"It is carried out that the tax resources are to be added to the 4 billion euros of the capital allocation that the State will put in place and the Société du Grand Paris to and from the project," the explanatory statement is taken.
The SGP does not find this system offensive at all.
"Since the moment when revenue is booked (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the design over three years and then only create out of the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This is recorded in the budget and removed from the budget."
The SGP is expected to start 2013 to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose four promised billion will be able to seek for a long time, is in danger of calling for a rather moving parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Explosive hackers and emsy spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a double meaning.
On one side it has emerged as an obvious scandal, a scandal which is only a scandal in the heart of holiness, which governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level, and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's move on to the line.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is to confirm the fact that every act created by a secret service (an x-like nation) consists exclusively of newspaper sections.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconis are nothing more than what you have been able to read over months, as well as in any x-like journal (except those whose owners are Berlusconi), and the horrendous caricature profile Gaddafis has been offering Cabaret artists fabric for their sketches for a long time.
The rule that secret files may only consist of already known news is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will realize that every work (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosenkreuzler) exactly repeats what was already written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (but because he did not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism believe nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
So are the secret acts.
The informant is faul, and faul (or limited mind) is also the head of the secret service ( otherwise he could be anything whatever, for example, editor at Libération), who only considers what he recognizes as true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which had sent the American message to the state desert in Rome, was the same as the newsweek had already published the week before.
So why was such a cancellation made for the disclosures of these files?
On the one hand, they say what any formed person already knows, that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representation tasks, have turned into spy centres.
Any viewer of detection films knows this very well, and it does not happen out of a sanity that you do so to ignore this.
Nevertheless, the fact that it is publicly repeated violates the task of holiness and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second: The idea that an x-fisted hacker can capture the secrets of the most powerful country in the world is the great blow against the prestige of the state desert.
In addition, the scandal brings less victims, rather than the "sharfrigers" in need.
But we dedicate ourselves to the deep nature of what has happened.
At the time of Orwell, all power could be combined like a big brother, who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have been perfectly well established since then, where you can control any movement thanks to the phone, any transaction done, the hotel visited, the selected motorway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if one looks at what is happening today, that even the secret encryptions of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the checkout stops being unilaterally directed and is circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen's root - can experience the secrets of power.
How, though, can a power no longer be able to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the character of Berlusconis or Merkels is essentially a secret free of secret, since it rewards the public spheres; but in the style of WikiLeaks, it reveals that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, meant to rob them of any power.
WikiLeaks has not done Sarkozy or Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this restriction, which has been added to such a powerful power?
It is obvious that the states will no longer place any information reserved in the future online - this would be the same as a road sign.
But it is also obvious that it is to be trusted to keep confidential reports on the phone confidential with current technologies.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state has moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could relationships be maintained in the future and only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction sounds after science fiction and romantic, but I see the need to introduce myself to the government agents to move in a secret way on uncontrollable routes, conveying their messages anywhere else than in the mere memory of themselves, and in addition to the few written information they have received, in the shelter.
The information would be stored in closed sheets in a single copy: basically the spying of Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology has progressed today like a cancer, that is, back.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analoged) video cassettes enabled film researchers to identify a film band for band by blowing up all the secrets of the installation from the back to the front, while the (numeric) CDs today make it possible to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macroporations.
With the high speed trains you can travel from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this requires three and a half hours per plane, including the take-off.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to return to cars and horses.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what was corrupted for secrets between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that require confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France beautifuls its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the compliance with the rapidly-resolved financing promises (also referred to as "Fast Start" or "early funding") implemented by developing countries.
And they're already discovered in the rough French beauties.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16, the EU drew up all the registers to convince its partners of the fact of its commitment to fixed-start financing: a detailed progress report of its Member States, a press conference, a large addition, a brochure distribution.
The operation transparency is remarkable and graded for its real value: the developing countries and civil society are happy to see if all developed countries do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces a release of €2.2 billion in 2010 which brings it in the right direction to ensure its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look into the detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional use has been introduced, without prejudice to public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the direction that he considers best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen as a guideline for those in 2009: international funding will be maintained and will contribute over 150 million in the framework of fast start funding over three years.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either with respect to the year or with regard to conditions at the level of public development aid.
In contrast, France was of the opinion that the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no guidelines for the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or even diminish) - France proposes to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" funding.
Another crucial element is the enclosing in donations and loans.
There is no rule over it yet, and each one chooses its own accounting mode.
Some, such as France, find 1 borrowed € as equivalent to 1 spent €.
Obviously this is only difficult to bear: the effort is not comparable.
If it is possible to justify the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often projects linked to the emission inhibition based on the most efficient technology) it is sad to present the euro that is taken as equivalent to a given euro... In addition, only the costs of the loan for the capital beneficiary country should be calculated as commitment (i.e. the equivalent of a interest rate).
But France has nothing but the following considerations: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by borrowing 91.5% (389.8 million euros) and spending 8.5%) - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country in the EU that borrows to a large extent.
Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (under others) to comply with their obligations 100% with donations.
In other words, if the majority of the European Union spends EUR 1 to fulfil its obligations, France will give just 10 cents and will understand a comparable use.
Nice hokuspocus!
All in all, France operates in its fixed-start financing with a double swivel: to part with a further development of the action over time and to the other part with the reality of the financial use.
France manages to believe that it has issued 420 million "new and additional" million in accordance with its promises and saves 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who did the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once the EU internal (why do the other Member States continue to make the donation if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter of the early funding is just a small question for relatively short time compared to the whole of discussions on the climate.
But it could be too much of the drop in the immense machinery of the UNICEF.
We hope this won't be the case.
Whatever the case, it is imperative to learn his lesson from this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its nature for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and equal justice with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could bring forward the discussions on the subject of long-term financing (a different, decisive and currently debated subject): the question of "reliability" or the nature of its lending is not absent.
France could change its position in order to be as progressive as it is in other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment Koscisko-Morizet, which will be held next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement about the fast start of France and its vision of "reliability" and the use of loans would naturally raise from the international basis of trust which is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Children's Pesticide
A 10-year-old child takes over the day 81 different chemical substances, a study published this Wednesday by the Generations Future Association (formerly movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that its results "in view of the low number of samples analysed did not show any statistically significant value, but rather illustrate the nature of the problem dealt with", had usually bought a meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris, between July and September, within four, from a child about ten years of age to a meal consumed.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - have been investigated as well as seams of laboratories looking for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The counter balance is low: 81 chemical substances, including 42 as possibly or probably cancerous and five as safe cariogen classified, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disorder, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance, are not exceeded in the approximate overall case, this survey is very well understood that the reality of the potential exposure to cancerous substances or substances with endocrine disorder to the consumer is of great concern," notes the Association.
Already during breakfast, the butter and the tea with milk already contain more than ten of the possibly carcinogenic residues and three safe as carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that may affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as an intermediate meal for the study, shows traces of six chemical substances, including a fungizide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, which are included in the lunches in which the study has identified traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
In addition, the hacksteak, the tuna fish from the bush, even the baguette and the rubber of pesticides and other chemical substances were chewed.
The analysis showed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak with 34 determined chemical residues was the "richest", and even the plastic lighter used to warm the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this "harmful cocktails" for consumers is "probably underestimated", says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed "in spite of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the "increase in civilisation diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of 365 residues of various pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
