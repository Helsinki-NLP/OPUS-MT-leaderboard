Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US President
US President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to take the peace prize here as the fourth president in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma and the medal and a cheque of $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the Northern Metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who selected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The president's couple then scheduled a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its peak with the ceremony, at which Obama takes over the prestigious prize.
He receives this as the fourth US President, but only as the third one who takes the price directly to the office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan when he takes over the prize.
The President does not want to get away with this because he knows that he is taking over the prize as a president who is currently leading war in two countries.
He reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forgot to highlight.
At the ceremony Obama also received the Golmedaille, the diploma and the check over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
The money he intends to give for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a specific charitable work.
The event programme then features a banquet with the President and his wife, with the exception of the Prime Minister and the Queen of Norway and another 250 guests loaded.
Obama was very slow at the price from the beginning.
For example, he suggested that he felt that he did not deserve the prize.
He also repeated that the price is not just for him, but for all those who strive for the same values as he.
Immediately after the announcement, he pointed out that this was "adjudication for action" for him.
Naturalists are accused of repression
The leadership police accused the president of the civil society "Natural protection community" of repression.
In several cases he filed appeals against some construction procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his calls he asked for money from the investors for his favor, said the chief politician, Alena Romova.
The president of the Leitmeritz-Naturschutz Community, Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in prison and he's threatened with a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorter garbage containers in Brünn don't smell good
In Prague, people can sort the drinking packages, in the South Sea villages you will find the sorter mill containers again step by step and step.
And in Brünn?
There you had to reserve a few minutes to find the right tons of garbage.
I don't want to say that the waste separation in Brünn would not work at all.
But I would like to know whether the Councilmen are concerned enough about this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brünn is located in the waste dumps in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens here can always dispose of paper, glass and plastics, but above all by the quantity of garbage for such wastes.
Have they ever tried to dispose of PET bottles in a collection basket, for example?
This is just art, above all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found so far by chance is the seaport opposite the Gans.
Mr Onderka is not going to make us angry with his colleagues, but this is too little for me.
Apart from the fact that waste separation is not also in other parts of the world.
A lot of my friends don't like to sort out the waste.
From falsehood.
It's too far for them to go to waste.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself after the celebration to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on the Konicova street, I did not see any colour-moulding tons in view.
Luckily, I got to the right place on the road.
But the garbage was almost over.
This is still the centre of Brünn, which represents the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and any kind of aesthetics are likely to cool down the socialists.
They prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that makes us ashamed in the whole Republic, instead of buying a few tons more garbage and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner well.
I am happy that I was able to confirm my acceptance with official statistics, after I have been searching the Internet for a while.
According to the ECO-KOM company data, Brünn is actually the worst in the whole area of South-Mähren.
The "Parubek" budget has taken out the money for pensions and sickness funds
After the left-wing party gave more money to farmers and officials in the government's view, there is no more money in the budget for rent, hospital money and construction.
But also not for the public debt or for the international court dispute.
This causes even more problems that will be in the government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists went through the increase in salaries for some groups, they calculated that the government was paying the money for sensitive expenditures, age pensions or for the health care. "This is just a waste of the problems in the future, mines," Janota says.
The credit is almost always paid higher interest rates, and you have to repay the money sometime.
Too much to choose, where to take, the state treasure is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the public sector are not reduced, the tax shall be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: the firearm, the teachers, the farmers.
And later on for her children.
In order for the pensions or the sickness money, which have disappeared from their account of 1.8 billion, people must not be afraid to get this money.
But for the price that the State owes itself even more - next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the state treasury, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will increase more and more quickly and with this the costs and interest will also increase.
The state will need the money for the compensation, then it will no longer be enough to raise VAT only slightly or to cut the maternity money, as the government did in its counter-ficiency package.
Because of the money gap in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing next year for the expansion of motorways and railways.
It is mainly the sections which have been obtained in competition, which can no longer be redesigned and possibly approved.
At the very least, it's not free.
This means delaying or setting up thirty large constructions, is also dangerous to European money creation, warns the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it resolves the flow of money in Solomonically - it affects the CEZ share dividends in which the State owns the majority and then spends the money in the transport fund.
The problem is that the level of dividends is never safe and it is not an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion from CEZ flow to the budget.
Every year, the dividends are paid out of environmental damage payments, the pension account is filled out, and this money is also used as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
In addition, according to EU rules, this trick increases the actual budget deficit at the level of 5.7% of GDP.
But this is not the end of the carnival of the revolutions.
Almost three billion fell in the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and for crimes or for costs for the court dispute, even for construction savings.
If the state gets to justice without this money, it's not safe.
It's just a game of luck.
If we lose an international dispute, then we have to pay it anyway, Janota makes clear.
The Minister will then have to save the money for resorts or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the already launched two billion-dollar project "State Fund", which will allow for monitoring on-line what individual authorities are spending on.
The first stage begins in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, warned Janota.
Your next smartphone will manage two operating systems
The Americans are counting for the future with a phone where the user can switch a single key between different operating systems by pressing.
The plans presented appear promising.
It's enough to press just one key, and from Windows Mobile will be in Android in less seconds.
This is exactly what the American company VMware wants to present, focusing on the development of the virtual software for the computer.
We allow you to execute two user profiles on the phone at the same time.
They can switch between these, they can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, said Srievas Krishnamurti from VMware company during the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
The market will come in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully run the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, on which at the same time the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems lived simultaneously.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now VMware works together with European and American operators at the smartphone virtualization and the customer are expected to come to the customer by 2012.
Snow scarcity on the mountains causes the hotel owners
The snowless slopes are not just the inhabitants of the Giant Mountains.
The missing snow also scares people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
This is why you can still get free rooms for all winter term including Christmas and Silver.
Our pages are often visited.
People go through the offers, fix the prices, but in the meantime they are afraid to order.
And when they call us, they immediately ask us whether, in our opinion, this year's Christmas party will be on snow or "on matsch", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, introduced.
Anyone who wants to stay in the spindelmühle just according to his ideas should no longer hesitate with the order.
Whoever prefers to save and where the quality of the stay comes first in second place, he can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners currently offer mainly weekly stays for the Silver Day.
I think they'll be trying to sell them for a long time, but then they'll have to post them, and they'll have to go to shorter times.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, estimated Jandura.
Free beds at all winter terminals are always also offered by the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the seats are still available.
That is why we have already prepared a few cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, led by the director of the travel office Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Silver Day in Giant Mountains can also offer the Vrchlabi travel office, but here there are less free places.
Good paragraphs are also found in the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter terms are sold on average.
This year the interest in winter stays is also negative because there is always no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are cut within a week, the Christmas will also be sold out, says skifert.
Reverse and something better than last year it's been able to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We're about five percent better than in the previous year.
On the Silver Day and Christmas we only have a few more free rooms.
There is great interest in Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec Hotel, Karel Rada.
At 80 percent for the silver stays, the Hotel Omnia is also located at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds are still available at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne at Christmas.
We were pleased to be surprised this year of January, for which we are already occupied by about 60 percent.
A bit weaker is now February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in the stay in the Giant Mountains is likely also increased, the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, led.
For a larger snow protection, the giant mountain hotel owners are currently waiting.
On Thursday it should cool down and if it hits, it should be snow on the mountains.
But then again a warming, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Restoration is Mother of Clues
It is almost comical, with which students' enthusiasm Barack Obama, President with his reputation as the wisest, repeats his predecessor's strategy in Afghanistan's question, which he himself considered to be the dumbest.
Finally, when he issued his 60-year-old Afghanistan doctrine, it was shown that he wrote it over the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq script for three years.
Not only did he use in the text himself the type of speech "as in Iraq", he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Forward Way" without losing weight.
Three years ago, he himself criticised the Bush idea - fresh troop quotas in the war-torn Iraq - as "unresponsible and Karastrophic decision" in its follow-up.
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, which came from military recommendations, was the only possible and in all likelihood very successful that we are not talking today about Iraq at all.
This did not improve the call Bushs, as objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than it was to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat itself.
In order to raise the troop quota, the military again asked him, especially the commander of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordinating habits, strongly criticised the devastating shields in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to convert the situation to better.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea, and thus he deceived the general with 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he has pressed the commitment for another 5,000, even if he himself originally had at least 10,000 calculations.
The most problematic of the whole Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that half-retirement will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the Brotherly War of recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well structured, its leaders respect the values.
The Afghan situation is marked by the counterindication - nobody can be left behind and no agreements will be kept.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces who are used to change their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even though they were formally established, remain only lighthouses behind which the patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The disparity of interest between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the uncertainty of the conditions that continue to complicate Pakistan's and Iran's influences.
It is also very unrealistic to build a "relevant state", which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation.
Time horizon of Obama's strategy alienated by his voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and is now on the edge of the explosion.
It is believed that the little soldiers who have broken into the war cry over the "early return" here create a miracle, can only a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date setting for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, because the Taliban will take this as the indirect opinion of the US defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fights in Afghanistan is declining.
Europe's politicians also cannot and will not explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindukush-Gebergspregsland.
Another possible factor that can radically affect the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, a very difficult question for the United States is whether the problem is not to be solved by troops.
This question has to be answered in the period during which America goes to Obama to take victory from Afghanistan.
But each solution will also mean a dramatic change in the Afghan situation.
The only sign of comfort for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years to the presidential election, so there is still enough time for him to take another strategy, if it would prove to be a total failure.
The manager of Bank Goldman Sachs no longer gets bonus bonus bonus in bar
The leading leaders of the American Bank Goldman Sachs won't receive any bonus bonus in bar this year.
This has been announced by the company, which reacts to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive shares instead of money that can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares may be deducted from the managers if they act excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Reuters Agency, makes efforts to connect the Wall Street Awards with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street is aware of the continuing direction in which it has to go, the former banker of JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott, led.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs made himself the target of criticism after she had spent nearly 17 billion dollars on bonus bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total level of the bonus bonus over the course of this year is likely to exceed 20 billion dollars even after the agency Reuters.
At the beginning of the financial crisis, the high bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries.
On Wednesday, Britain reported that it intends to charge the banker's bonus, which exceeds 25,000 pounds, once with a tax of 50 percent.
Similar steps are also being taken by France.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prize in all fields, except in physics.
Five record women today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf took the Nobel Prizes this year in the professional and literary categories.
In addition to the four scholars, the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was among them.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with her countryman Jack Szkotak, have received the Nobel Prize for Medicine for Research in the Chrome area.
The price for chemistry was given by Israeli Ada Jonathan, together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, to clarify the Ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatin awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics that American woman Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson received for analyses of the economic report.
The only specialist category in which no woman received a Nobel prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao have contributed to research in glass fibers and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis for all digital cameras, fax devices or astronomical remote pipes.
Each of these prize holders has received the diploma, the Nobel Prize and a certificate on the acquisition of the money prize.
It represents ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several prize holders in each category, the price will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has received the most expected peace prize in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech he recognized the controversy of his appointment, because he was only at the beginning of his journey, and was also at the top of the country, leading two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the fight against world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering the retreat. Klaus invited him into the castle
President Vaclav Klaus welcomes the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who is thinking about his stay in the government on Friday, because he does not agree with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form that was released by the Assembly on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the staying of Janota in the cabinet will be the subject of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the state deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The president, Radim Ochovat, informed about the meeting.
Janato wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, on Monday about his further stay in office.
Under the budget law, which now receives Klaus for signature, the Czech Republic should manage with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
However, Parliament agreed on the left-hand side proposals for money laundering on Wednesday and increased the money for civil servants, for the maintenance of social services and direct wages of farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of social democracy to cover up the budget deficit.
Between the left-wing party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right-wing party on the other, there has been a sharp domestic dispute, which is why there is a question about the further work of the Fisheries Office, on which the ODS, CSSD and the Green Party have agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was adopted by Parliament, is practically liquidated the package of savings measures implemented by the fishermen's government in the autumn and that, in their understanding, it is intended to put an end to public debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, but does not have to, today in the debate with the entrepreneurs, explained that the politicians had neglected for a long time the "serious problem" of the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only lead to a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of the political parties.
The ODS president, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is gross, and the government should consider its further existence.
The ODS President, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
Primer Fischer referred to words similar to "strong challenges" in the editorial.
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the state deficit was grossly gross that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and exceeded the 200 billion crowns.
As of Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
The People's Party was pleased, too.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeatable" of the world shows much of the country, its struggle and victory despite some criticisms, that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents in his life story of the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the ninety-nine-year-old Mandela if he could represent him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is taken by Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm gonna play you, I'm gonna have to meet you.
The two-and-a-half-year-old actor who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood Drama from the box "Million Dollar Baby" was already the leader of the movement to abolish slavery, from which he became a slave holder, a fictional U.S. president, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but only rarely anyone who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African Stateman was in prison for 27 years for his active activity in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990 and was president of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unsuccessful", and at the same time is the name of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film depicts a real event in which Nelson Mandela joined his forces with the Captain of the South African Back Byte, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people are still racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes that he can share his people with the sport, so he decides to share with the back players who belong to the outside world.
Finally, the South African team rises to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema wall.
He had no other goal than to play this role as closely as possible to bring it closer to reality," Freeman said.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to speak as he did.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, eat with him in the evening and be behind the scenes before his talk.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that when I shot your hand, I took over your energy, it was transferred, and I had the feeling that I knew what you felt, he said.
For me, it is important to be another person.
Matt Damon is in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national backup team, in which the white players have considered.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the hardback world.
It was a great surprise for him when he first met Pinaar in his house.
I remember when I sounded at the Turklingel that he opened up and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the film'.
Despite the obvious differences in the status of actors compared to their actual models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of the director of Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeatable" and also talks about prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, wrote his evaluation in the following words: "It was a very good story, a very well-executed film."
In film reviews on the web pages of rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive reviews.
Light secret solved via Norway: The Russians have tested a rocket
Over Norway a special light effect was to be observed of unknown origin.
Only yesterday did the Russian Ministry of Defence agree that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
But the start was not successful again, and the rocket, called the type "Bulava", which should be originally the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the dawn of the Russian generality as well as the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on site at the rocket test also had no positive effect on the success of the sample flights.
Bulava has usually not been started or damaged in the air at all.
In the Russian newspapers it is already written about "Bulava" as "a rocket that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th attempt, it was normal in the beginning.
In turn, technical damage occurred on the rocket only at the end of the flight.
Probably exploded the engine in the third rocket level.
This time "Bulava" started from the atom-U-boot Dmitrij Donskij, which sailed under the water of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the escape from the U-boat.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an unspecified flying object over the north roads was actually the damaged "Bulava".
In addition, since the first moment the Norwegians have not doubted that it is a Russian missile.
This time, the generality has defended itself and claims that one cannot speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fall out and the third stage was only affected by the accident.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage at the same time.
Even if no test started without error, the management of the Ministry of Defense has only six out of thirteen failed.
The almost 50 percent success therefore meets the generality with optimism, and it is still claimed that the "bulava" will fly once without problems and even up to ten hypersonic atomic heads with a total weight of up to 1,15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov has signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow with 51 years old
The legendary opponent Vjaceslav Fetisov presents himself with 51 years in a professional ice hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup owner is helping his CSKA Moscow team in need, and is probably already taking part in the Freitat Duel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career for forty years in 1998, is currently President of the Cska.
After Denis Kuljas was injured, we urgently need another opponent.
Fetisov has trained regularly and agreed to support the team.
We only need a few other formalities to clarify, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow Club of Sergej Nemcinov.
Meanwhile, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only concern a game.
I believe that Fetisov is one of those who can lift the morals of other partners, the co-player Nemcinov started.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice surface, he becomes the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary stormer Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and was able to award 15 matches and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the Dress of the Soviet Union he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championships, and also won in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career he also collected success in the NHL, where he twice held Stanley Cup over the head in Detroit Dress.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Icecocky Star Room.
Hyundai left the trade unions. All over-hours will be lifted
The management of the Nosovice Automobile factory Hyundai agreed with the trade union to abolish all overtime.
Due to frequent over-hours, the trade union announced the strike readiness on Monday.
This was confirmed by the speakers of the Hyundai Automobile Factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday story this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, 19 December, voluntary overtime was proposed on the basis that two stories would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a 400 CZK bonus to employees who would work the Saturday story.
The employees also receive this in the wake of the Saturday story of November 28.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime allowance or they can take a replacement leave on December 28th and so extend the Christmas celebration, Vanek took up.
In addition, all employees of Saturday's history are paid the fare and lunch.
In view of the fact that the over-hours of the most urgent and burning point were the demands and complaints of the trade unionists who had put up production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the lifting of all over-hours for the month of December, Vaněk started.
The employees of the automotive factory were forced to work almost every day after the eight-hour shift for another 2 hours until last week.
From the signing of the agreement, the line preparation by trade unions shall be revoked.
Further negotiations between the management of the automotive industry and the trade unions will take place on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that, if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they will be ready to lift the race's readiness.
The situation in the car factory was suspected last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees were spontaneous due to overtime.
They also protested against the poor payment conditions and alleged fraud.
The management was opposed to the need for employees to make overtime to meet the automotive supply requirements.
The trade unionists also called for no sanctions to be imposed on employees who had interrupted production on Monday.
In the area of overtime, trade unions demand to reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they are asking for the payment of 5,000 SEK this year.
The Nosovice automotive factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
The series production was launched in November last year.
Up to this September, about 80,000 vehicles were produced here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech Discovery: a substance that also works with ¿counted ́ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new connections to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works with the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the connection to common virus variants does not work as strongly as one of the existing medicines.
The disease of AIDS cannot be cured yet.
Patients may be able to prolong their life and prevent the increase of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a whole series of side effects.
In addition, incomplete suppression of the virus enlargement results in development of resistance to which no medicines are more effective.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, of the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and of the University of Heidelberg opens the way for dealing with the virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances called metallic carborene affect the protein that is responsible for the enhancement of the HIV virus.
The metal carborene are compounds of bore, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus proliferation in a different way than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, scientists have developed new 'improvements' compounds that have been prepared based on the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding on the virus protein.
The metal carboreans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-dimensional cages that consist of bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Domestic and persistent virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, no mature viral particles would occur.
If we turn off the HIV protease, we also turn off the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe the whole series of connections in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
Something weaker but more reliable
The effects of this series of substances against HIV protease were tested in the reagent glass, including against their persistent (resistant) variants obtained by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of the metal carboran on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as on the medicinal product used in clinical trials, but does not lose its effect on the resistant agents against which the medicinal products used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action as well as its other characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical formations, makes metal carbourans interesting links for further research on the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, Head of the Laboratory for Structural Biology of Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute for Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Fight for budget. ODS went to fisher, who resists
The president of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, referred to the approved budget for next year as "graenvoll" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, in his opinion, assume its continued existence.
The expression of the ODS was referred to by the Prime Minister as "strong arguments".
It may be time for the analysis.
The vice-president of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party apparently no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to combating the growing deficit or whether he is staying in the office using parliamentary links.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
Parliament adopted the 2010 budget on Wednesday, but with left-wing amendments of more than 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased the money for civil servants, for the maintenance of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of social democracy to cover up the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to save 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the room before the vote, so it has complied with the Government's request, because the amended budget is also only a less bad version of the budget.
Discouragement and insanity
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke about his disappointment and a sense of insanity, which led Prime Minister Jan Fischer to say that the government is still evaluating the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened the situation with his resignation, the amendments would have been accepted, the situation would have been different.
According to the Czech TV, Janota signed up for Monday after the Prime Minister's government business.
He has indicated that he has completed his further stay in the office.
The reason for this is his disappointment over the budget's commitment.
To the extent that Fisher has expressed himself for the further struggle with the budget deficit, according to Necas, the nominees of Social Democracy (CSSD) who had undergone the changes in the budget have not done anything in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will be retiring if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-increasing laws, such as those relating to health and pension funds or the new service laws.
Topolanek: The Ministers nominated by ODS did not hesitate
This is the matter of the Prime Minister and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS made no mistakes, Topolanek highlighted in a text message from the United States.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are people in representative position who acknowledge to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fisher decides to refuse to fight the deficit level of public finances, "it is entirely logical and correct that he is relying on the left-hand majority that is currently in Parliament".
Then he can't possibly count on the support and tolerance of the citizens' democracies.
I have not thought about it, and if it is up to me, then I will deal with it, the Minister of Defence, nominated by the citizens' Democrats, Martin Bartak, told the journalists in Parliament.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer flew to the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS returns to the Prime Minister's request
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in Parliament if the Prime Minister would expressly ask the representatives of the citizens' Democrats to allow them to adopt the budget.
We do not appear to be children, we are not small children, so he responded to the question of whether the ODS was not repressed in the political debate on the budget by the absence of the chairman of Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice my voice would be missing.
As soon as I gave up on the mandate, I knew that in the next few months, it would go mainly to the Bolshevik of Parliament and destroy everything positive, Topolanek responded himself.
Following the new CD (Czech Railway) road schedule, fewer trains will be driven at about the same price.
On 13 December, the Czech railway ends or limits some less outloaded speed and local trains, while other connections are reinforced.
The total volume of traffic is reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new roadmap compared to today.
Most rates including basic and customer fares are not changed.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava area have several connections to the capital, the railway is setting up for these trains of the type Pendolino.
The train will no longer drive to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less speed trains are also driven on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad are reduced.
The largest reduction is planned by the railway in the Hradec Kralove district, a total of eight percent, on an increase of Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains will also be lifted on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and on a few days a week the operation of some speed trains on the Prague - Pisek route will be reduced.
The biggest changes include the introduction of the new direct road from Milovice to Prague, and the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem need to move.
It is the fifteenth roadway of the pre-shipment transport system Esko, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The distance to the capital will end at the Prague Main Station.
The CD introduces more lines of connection SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/ Jesenik will be driven in two hours.
With the pendolino, the passengers can no longer drive to Bratislava since December 13.
This year's account for regional railways: increase by 200 million
The fast trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, the railway will receive a total of eight billion crowns in the coming year for the so-called liquidity loss, just as this year. The local trains provide the districts, they will pay for it in the next year for eight billion crowns, with the state shooting three billion.
This year the regional trains are worth 200 million Czech crowns.
For the local trains and the high-speed trains, the railway has recently concluded a ten-year contract, until now the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The railway boasts the system, which may also have not taken into account the price increase in the large majority of the vehicles.
There is only one day's online CD Net and cheap eLiška Internet Tickets.
For travellers without the customer card, the price of CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price eLiška will then depend on the risked plot, until now it was uniform for the journey between any districts and cost 160 crowns.
More than 50 people were found in the Philippines, and the children were released.
Today, millitante has kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
This was indicated by the AFP Agency, which initially only informed about 65 exports.
All 17 children arrested were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
The funeral took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 millilitans reportedly used the hostages as a living shield in the flight to the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to publish the rest of the hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the militias are members of the Neuvolksarme (NPA), this is the weaponry of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers because of the violence, which called for racketing between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the standard law was imposed because of the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of November 23rd, which coincided with the election to the Government, were 30 journalists.
Due to suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippines province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But on Tuesday, they resumed the peace negotiations with the Philippine government.
The story of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods comes to the American cinemas "Invictus: the Unbeatable", which includes part of the life story of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The subsidiary role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar, received Matt Damon.
At the start of the film, reactions from critics as well as the public are also heard.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolilaha Mandela, born 18 July 1918 in South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakhar Prize, then in 1993 together with the Klerk the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Large expectations are placed in the film because it comes into the cinemas at a time, where preparations for the World Cup are culminating in South Africa, but at the same time, the media are threatening the world's public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and the discrimination of the population by the black majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are first of all positive, despite numerous reservations against the establishment of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of his own words on the new film.
From this role I have dreamed for many years and have prepared well for it.
On several occasions I met Nelson Mandela personally so that I - as you say - could receive his energy, he led the interview after the film's film premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good to be able to remember the personality of Mandela and his message with this film.
This is a story of South Africa, but it concerns every person, he added.
In the dress of the Rugby National team
The film is based on the book presentation by British writer John Carlin, freely translated ́In the role of the enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game that the people have united, depicts the South African human rights defender within his first presidential period.
Morgan Freeman is trying to bring together groups of people who have been separated from each other in the course of the film, and as Nelson Mandela in 1995, he is also taking part in his role in the World Cup World Africa National Rugby Address in South Africa.
For the entry of the race in the dress, which applies almost as a holy act in South Africa, Mandela took large ovations fourteen years ago, mostly from the white audience and thus gained recognition of the white population.
The Backby Championship is perhaps fulfilling the task of bringing the people together again to one people, led by the Backby Player Chester Williams, who was the only "Black" in the National Team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa improves, it will only show itself.
But the white South Africans are skeptical, as in the recent interview for LN of the Rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The Championship begins on 11 June 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out tomorrow at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switchboard at the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
At the fire, according to the speaker of the district fire department Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, entered six units.
Initially, the firearm wanted to burn the transformers, but later it changed its view, and now the fire with a mixture of water - foam and special solvents is removed.
The reason was a technical defect, a transformer-in-circuit.
No one was injured, the Havaria threatened, according to the company spokesman, Pavla Mandatova, the safety operation of the management system.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, more precisely the damage will be recorded only after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one, according to Mandatova.
For more than 10 years, Ceps' society has not experienced anything like this, mistakes are rare, she added.
According to the spokesperson of CEZ for Nordböhmen, Sona Holingerova, power supply was not interrupted, due to the fire of the Trafostation, the functionality of households, authorities and companies was not affected.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as a single operator of the management system, electricity lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switch systems with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred to the distribution system and control line with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jancura picks up a fine for slander against three leaders of the CSSD.
The owner of the student agency, Radim Jancura, today picks up a fine for slander against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of Südmähren, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute interview in the radio journal.
The complaint is linked to the company's efforts to operate regional transport in some areas.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railway.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take out the Roses, while we've only subverted the offer over the scope as agreed with them.
They claimed that we were more expensive than the Czech Railways because we would know the prices of the Czech Railways that were completed last week.
There's nothing else left for us to resist.
Because of this humiliation of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the Radio Journal.
At the same time, he indicated that he had evidence from all areas that they had taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a case for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the collection of the fine for the further continuation of Jancura's media show, which serves him as a free advertising for his society as well as for his own person.
I am, of course, prepared to defend my good names and the good reputation of my district, and I also ask for further leaders.
I take it that it will also become clear in this matter that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the case of regional rail traffic and uses false and false arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura already reported last week that he invested several million crowns in advertising, which will indicate the harmful step of the district.
He told the Radio Journal that he was interrupting the campaign after Christmas, and he wants to continue after New Year's.
He specified that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign started Jancura after the districts agreed on regional rail transport with the Czech Railway and did not award bids for the order in a total of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of the train traffic in the districts, Jancura said he was also already a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we didn't give up that we could lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, Jancura told the Radio Journal today.
Vaccines against pneumococcals free of charge and free of charge
Immunisation against pneumococcals changes the habit from January.
It should be free and voluntary as the first for the families.
But now there are votes that the mandatory impact would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals culminate.
The Institute of Medicinal Products is already setting the maximum prices of the vaccines to be paid by the health insurance companies.
The experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines for free for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated for free against pneumococcals born on and after 2 August.
The condition is that they have not received a vaccine yet.
Anyone who has already started the vaccination in the last year or earlier must also pay another relapse.
The first dose of the vaccine must be given between the third and fifth months of the child's life.
Already last year, a quarter of families had their children improvised against pneumococcals.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
In total, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the vaccine doses spend 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year.
However, they save for treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all surface vaccines of children.
The mandatory immunisation was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcals cause measles, but also severe infections including strokes and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections cause us to die after a study in hospitals every year of up to 28 children under 10 years of age.
Outside of the Czech Republic, the children's mandatory impact on pneumococcals was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
As of January, this will be paid by the insurance companies and will be voluntary.
For example, the chief of the Nahlas Association, Rudolf Kalovski, mentioned the need to improve the impact of the obligation.
Its association is already long-term for the Pneumococcal impression.
The experts at the international conference at which our association was involved were not very satisfied that we had a voluntary vaccination.
That's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have managed to do it at least.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcals.
At this point, we do not consider this at all, his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen said.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claimed.
The president of the company of practical children’s doctors, Hanna Cabrnochova, adds that a voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, one could think about reducing the number of relapses, "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccine was started as voluntary," says Cabrnochova.
The experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to imprison their infants against pneumococcals from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcals is also a violation of the fact that it is paid as the first area vaccination of the disease insurance and not by the State.
The insurance should spend the money on prevention to save them for further treatment, Kabrnochova says.
Doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This, however, is linked to the care of the practical medicines involved in the purchase of the vaccines.
According to the original project, the vaccines should be purchased by insurance and then obtained by doctors in the same way as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
However, some Members feared that insurance could "make money out of health insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait for insurance to pay them.
According to estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
That won't be easy, says Cabrnochova.
US artist's son participates in "Museum Steel"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was included when inviting 90 paintings in his vehicle with trailers.
It means Frank Frazetta Junior and another man would have used a bagger to get into the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his depiction of figures like Conan of Barbara and Tarzan.
As the news agency Associated Press reported, the artist stopped at the time of the event in Florida.
AP quoted a senior police officer as saying that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family funeral.
According to a police statement, Frasetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father, "that he should enter the museum with all means to bring all the paintings into a camp".
The Agency informed him that Frank Frazetta was opposed to having granted any permission.
Labour defends state and tax increases
The Ministers have defended the tax increases and expenditure stops, as announced in the Bureau's report, against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and trade unions.
The conservatives said that Alistair Darling would have had an opportunity to "strengthen" to show that he meant it with the reduction of the deficit by removing the decisions until after the election.
The treasurer also operates under the authority of workers with low and middle income.
Its main proposals include a 0.5-percent increase in social security and a 1-percent ceiling on public payrolls for 2011.
Social security benefits
On the other hand, the unions have protested that low-gloh recipients are being punished for a recession that they have not caused and warned of the upcoming "problems".
The increase in social security - at about 3 billion British pounds per year - has exacerbated the private sector, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic growth.
The increase limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year will affect about 10 million workers.
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PUBLIC AREA
Increase in social security by another 0.5% from April 2011
This year's economic decline by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on bank bonds
1 % increase in corporate tax for small enterprises rejected
Tax pads for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in government pensions by 2.5%
According to estimates of the treasure, someone with an annual income of £30,00 per year will be poorer by £90 per year and someone with £40,00 per year will be poorer by £ 190, while a person with £10 per year income will be richer by £110.
The Ministers said their target of deficit recovery by 2013 meant "hard decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional taxes would be charged to the 5% of the top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms argues that the outlined tax increases and expenditure stops would be "a drop on the hot rock" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are large numbers. They will bring us the deficit relief and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party's forecasts of future economic growth – affecting the extent of debt and the speed of the deficit reduction – were questioned after the treasurer was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year - much more than the fall of 3.5% predicted in April - while the debt would be higher by 3 billion £ than previously suggested.
Missed opportunity
The conservatives, who want to start a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn Labour's "debt crisis", said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years was unsustainable.
They added that the ministers have failed to submit a credible plan, how they will repay it and press "synically" before making difficult decisions until after the elections - which will have to take place at the latest in June 2010.
"They didn't say anything about what they're going to do," said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had their chance to do this, and they let them go."
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour maintains that schools, hospitals and the police are kept from future cuts, unlike the conservative proposals, which see the deficit capping faster and more quickly.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money that will be earned by the tax increases and expenditure stops will be used to cover the expenditure for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans will be "built on sand".
The BBC political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements - such as the above inflation adjustment in some people with disabilities in the next April - the treasurer would put the chancellor at risk of voting, as the money could just be recovered in the next year.
Labour continues to provide extra aid when people need it most and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler state"
Although the Ministers have not announced state details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public expenditure will only come in the medium term.
The recognised Institute for Tax Research said that the figures of the treasurer would mean strong cuts in many areas, perhaps in the future also in the fields of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It will only ease the pain later," said his manager Robert Chote.
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them all," Roger Bootle added, an economic adviser to Deloitte's business audit firm.
"This was just the high pre-existing report, and the markets recognize it."
FBI investigates "Festivities of US citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported US citizens because of the suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in an accident at a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Pandschab province, the American message in Pakistan was shared by the BBC.
The FBI said it is being investigated whether the same men were reported missing in the last month in the United States of Virginia.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said they are also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are to be Pakistani descent, one is Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, of course we are very interested in the prosecutions they are being accused of and under what circumstances they are being held," said Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit said the authority was informed about the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay, if they are actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police were already interested in the house and that there were no charges against the men arrested.
The news agency Reuters reported that it refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the United States "should cooperate with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing at the end of November of their families in North Virginia.
Amnesty condemns "misuse" in Iran
According to an Amnesty International Human Rights Organization report, human rights in Iran remains as bad as it has been in the past 20 years.
The report details "disuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran withdrew its earlier criticism of its human rights balance.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
Following the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadinedshad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens of people were killed, leading to the biggest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
dozens of prisoners and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC-Teheran correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests of the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, some of the allegations of abuse were acknowledged and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak Street Station.
But since then, there has been no tolerance for criticism from the authorities, our correspondent said.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer student Ibrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and of protesting the election results.
"They beat me in the face more often," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my head, on my head ... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and became, still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the street, Amnesty told him.
The successful presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators arrested after the election were tortured in August in prison and others raped.
The Iranian authorities lied about the allegations of rape, but reported that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also called the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been detained with 75 more than eight weeks in a container in a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the concerns about the election and the government's reactions to it, but so Amnesty, the mandates and the power of these bodies would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees would not have been published.
The group said that at least 90 people were arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to turn a mark in Bristol into a competition track.
The ski trails of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money.
At the top of the hanging in the Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump chance at the beginning of a 100-metre hang.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a wonderful view from the top of the hangs, but it was also quite scary.
It is a great view with all the lights in the city that shine below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some right talents."
Prices were awarded for the best art or tricks performed on the hang.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow will be left to melt.
She's still with us.
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted for a ban on mining and the concern about the alleged Islamism of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a well-founded and well-founded report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe's most secularised societies.
Some readers will read this new book with admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't love headlights" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and densely argumentative study of a question that the country shared over half a decade and occupied and its effects are still to be observed today.
Above's newest book offers a more comprehensive and cooler spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in the field.
He spent months in Moscow, schools and institutions that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it "Islamic Free Spaces".
He's a good listener, he's giving talks between teachers and students about the questions they're most worried about.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a councilhouse (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use a censored banking system to obtain a mortgage?
These seem to be profanity issues, he claims that those who make up daily life are quite different from the political dramas that the media employ.
The author recognizes a new generation of Imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, perhaps with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who questioned Bowen are mostly unconcerned with their Salafi rivals – the persecutors of the purist Sunni Islam, which is associated with Saudi Arabia – today show a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be agreed upon.
But an agreement requires both giving and taking.
He asks how much French political decision makers (and the intellectual elite who so passionately watch the separation of the Church and the State) really feel obliged to pluralism.
It indicates that Muslims may experience a more severe treatment than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews who had to compromise their historical commitment to secular republicanism.
Rather, he recognizes a "strengthening of value screws" as a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book you tend to say "Yes, but not yet".
The Most Restless View of the World
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice, which it marks, melts with alarming speed and takes life with it, which can survive nowhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have entered the newly opened water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their source water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, presents in "On thin ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icon of the North, the ice bear.
In the complicated history and politics of the forest, he describes the long tradition of Arctic researchers who have proved themselves in the hunt for ice bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an ice bear as a tender 14-year-old Fännrich to the lake, who fought only with the rifle of his musket, is of course a legend, but others are true.
Young bears who were captured when they swam behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 ice bears in a presentation.
Even today zoos still typically have a million of the living area of a wild animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the ice bear in Singapore was completely green from the algae that grew in the tall hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters represent for survival of the species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the settlement continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and motorcycle-driving inuit use powerful storms to bring their benefits to the track.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice" (original title "After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former publisher of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a comprehensive insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
However, this is not due to a lack of explanations.
The pioneer journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries for the first time revealed the confusion of the package.
Subsseeboats measure in the Cold War the shifting degrees in the subspecies.
A useful supplement is satellite measurements and the large-scale launch of measuring probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by fearless people who camp outside the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the unique, tiny world of the influx system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater salts that are compressed when freezing.
But, beginning from the bear on the ice to the microscopic little wonder in the ice, all are at risk when the summer season is over, which is calculated between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ... we could be"
Marine infantrymen were among the 6,000 who landed in Arlington Kränze
The mountain free De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to place a single cross on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other marine infantry, who took the trip of Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Friedhof in Arlington to decorate digs, the day was a tributary to the men and women in whose steps they entered.
In a few months, from where we are always brought back, we could be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay limits on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Freedhof.
Morril Worcester, the owner of the tear-and-tight Worcester Wraith Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992, when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred digs at the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morril and his wife Karen, who undertake this journey every year, continue in different cities along the way to carry out events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also established a non-profit organization, Wraiths Across America, which extended the event to other states.
In this year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crossings on the miners at the Arlington Freedhof, in the areas of the Pentagon, at the National Friedhof Fayetteville in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York and at the memorial site for the United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation spent for the second time more than $150,000 for the purchase and transport of the border.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said that she had taken the journey to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Though her husband is not in Arlington, Hunt said this is her way of giving back something that the victims brought back.
She said that this is a small contribution, how we can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family funeral.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked across the extended lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves of the 1st and 2nd World War and Vietnam war as a goal, as they are not visited as often as the newer graves, so the organizers.
The mood was joyful, children played, and couples held on, while they carried the fresh pine branches to the grey excavators.
Each round crane was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is nearby and where mainly the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations spent 1,000 borders to decorate this section, but the darker mood of the current wars fulfilled this area.
Individuals crying openly, others praying, and families and friends stuck together in the icy air.
Some read the names measured in stone, while others bowed down to small black and white squares, which were stuck in the damp mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who threw bitter tears before her son's grave.
It's 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the graveyard of Marine Infraternary Officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in the fight in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"If I've been gone for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractor of the U.S. government of Cuban authorities arrested
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor from the U.S. government, who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers, such as USAID, the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials of the US representation in Havana try to gain access to the prison, which was arrested on 5 December.
The special prosecutions have not yet been published, although Cuban law allows a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor to be arrested for almost everything, under the indictment of the "infringement".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include mild protests and critical scriptures, pose a risk of imprisonment.
Government-friendly graffiti and statements are considered as serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing blogger community, led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to face prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase the tensions between the Communist government of the Castro Brother in Cuba and the Obama government, which had sought a "slow" approach to improving the relationship to the island.
The message of the arrest was first reported on Friday by the New York Times.
The new US policy appreciates that the United States will be rewarded when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and desired products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee are $15 per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are mostly used for sending text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost a day's pay.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government sites, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is limited.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens in Cuba are in prison for crimes like drug smuggling behind the grid, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokesman of the U.S. representative in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide any further information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the release of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the "Human Rights Watch" group, which recently issued a hard report on freedom in Cuba with the title "New Castro, same Cuba", an introduction to Raul Castro's office as the country's leader, who replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused would be arrested, convicted and arrested very often within one day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries are moving towards more dialogue.
Cover Pakistani government representatives plan to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities discovered a allegedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said that they hoped that this case could help to discover an extensive network of terrorist seekers who search the Internet for radicalized young men.
Researchers said that they were looking for an impartial rebel, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had discovered them because one of them had submitted comments on the Internet video site on YouTube that agreed to terrorist attacks.
After arriving in Pakistan, Saifullah was the leader of these men and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and his terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistan's Secret Service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the Al-Qaida leader that men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to submigrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were detained for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the unfair mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered to be part of a hidden operation.
Therefore they were rejected, the government official who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter said.
The Government official said that the men were not discouraged and continued to try to receive the correct recommendations to gain access to the Al-Qaida warehouses when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI - underlines the crucial role of the applicants in identifying future terrorists and perhaps even more important in determining who is trusted.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, it has made the US Home Service a matter of the highest urgency to subjugate human assets within Al Qaida.
The applicants of the organization seem to be pharaohs who do not allow those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and such who might be spies.
American power recruits are subject to a special test by A Kaida, analysts said.
Due to their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, however, they are also considered to be unscrupulous attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have become much more careful in recent years as to whom they have allowed access, because the US Home Services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to include someone in these groups, what better way could you go than following the recruitment model that so many have already followed?
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators are calling for climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded from the dealers at the Bella Congress Centre in the city's cooler climate protection.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, but the police estimates were about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists burned small explosive bodies near some government buildings in the city.
On a day when the UN-funded climate negotiations little happened, thousands of activists walked through the city with transparency, on which there was "There is no planet B" in English and one in Spanish, which said "The Earth says "Genug".
Some stars joined the protest, such as the Danish model, photographer Helena Christiansen, who said that the journeys to Peru, the country of the birth of her mother, make her aware of the heartening problems the country has to deal with due to the already felt effects of climate change.
This is part of the reason why I have decided to take part in the great demonstration - to continue the word and appeal to the world leaders to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it needs to be done now and there is no way around it.
The police stopped the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella Centre and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the fact that they were either masked or carrying bags.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to an observer who did not want to be mentioned, as he is involved in climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothes burned several explosives near the Copenhagen Main Channel, near which there are several ministries.
They threw them near the building, he said and added that they started as light-trackers, but then were followed by "a few large explosions".
Inside the Congress Centre, people gathered in front of television screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest apparently did not reach the consciousness of the chief executive, such as Su Kie, China's head climate dealer.
When asked whether he thought the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he said in English, "That's something I didn't even know."
He went on to Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He found that it depended on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the broad public and various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they interfere with the negotiations or the freedom of others".
Test data show severe rash
Last week, the witness to math performance was welcome good news for public schools in Washington, D.C.
Although the Washington District is still far behind the schools of the country, the evidence shows that in the past two years, the four- and eight-year-olds have made faster progress than the cities that include Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the hard work gap between African and white students, both at local and national levels.
The average score of the white fourth graders from Washington D. C. in the last two years rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but only about three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the Afro-American eighth graders remained essentially the same, with a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is not encouraging either.
When the first NAEP was recorded in this district, the gap between the white and black quadrants 2003 and the first NAEP was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the number of points that the children of both groups have reached has grown in this timeframe, the difference with now has barely decreased by 58 points.
Last week, some district education advocates expressed their concern that the results of student Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty were preceded by the majority of white students, who are already powerful children.
This means that we have raised the overall assessment by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, Jeff Smith, a board member of D.C. Voice, said, a non-profit group that enters Washington D.C. for education equality.
I do not jump for a span of two or three points and down, the democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Eaton Primary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of test points is that the city's secondary schools need urgent attention.
Of course you always want to see the positive signs that I respect.
What scares me, however, is that we do not spend almost the time and energy we should spend on our secondary school.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the weak students.
In this autumn, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new curriculum, the Wilson-Lesse system, aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and secondary schools, which did not master basic skills at the beginning of their school course and which are significantly behind their same classrooms.
Daily mathematics, a curriculum that takes the lead from the kindergarten to the sixth class of games and life experiences, has been assigned to Washington under former Head of School Inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is accompanied by some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to bring the best measures to the benefit of the students who are below the level of the score, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and can continue to provide additional money and resources for the weak schools that are necessary to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, Professor of Education at the University of California in Berkeley, who investigates urban results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on schools in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The aim could be to bring political consequences that work against this important agenda item.
The point is, of course, as with other city school inspectors, that they try to keep the white and black middle layer.
Our focus is on ensuring that we create a system of large schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the city districts so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to close the service gap is to extend the traditional public school year that is currently 180 days in Washington to compete with the charter schools.
One has to increase the school year for about 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement over 185 days a year with his teachership, which he considers to be "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than the future
The bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, climbs out and shines a moment in view of the white pillars, the brick facades and the emerald green breed.
Graciela's parents have barely completed the high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was buried in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set a foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eight classes of the group, the Gettysburg, where the teaching costs $38.690 per year, was more of a fearsome visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! I will be here soon!" called Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she thoughtfully said when she was told the low teacher-to-student relationship of the school.
The College in Pennsylvania was the 7th, which the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have fully accepted the intended message: The question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children of Spanish immigrants born in the United States, who do not end high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand there are also hundreds of thousands who receive college education that is needed to get up into the middle layer.
In fact, one of the five "second generation" of Hispano-Americans closes the college – which is a remarkable performance, as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having finished high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the labour force of the country.
Those who study powerful children say they often have a natural affinity for the school and an inner drive to succeed.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of confidence in American schools.
But consulting programs also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children to get to college, especially if these efforts continue over a longer period of time.
If you consider poor income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure at any time will not solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, who examined Hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing these children with a supportive network from preschool to high school.
The federal program that had funded Gracielas College Tour is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - One step high - and makes more than $300 million per year available for local school systems to start college preparatory programs that start when poor students are in high school and continue until they have completed high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of whom more than 60% have gone to college.
Iraq's Ministry of Oil concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to re-establish its damaged infrastructure in two auctions concluded on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil are close to the fact that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been affected by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies could only share in two of the 10 raised fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which started on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid has drawn the shorts.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields raised in June.
In the opening of the Iraqi oil industry, the fine representatives of American oil mills surprised the analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of US companies, Asian and Europeans are on the way, Ruba Husari, the publisher of Iraq Oil Forum, said an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns raised by massively coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability by the withdrawal of the U.S. military have probably stopped American oil companies, as analysts have said, to engage more strongly in Iraq, which has the third largest proven oil reserves in the world.
US firms were in some cases disadvantaged because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, had significantly lower wages and risks because they did not have to account for the shareholders.
Exxon Mobile and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Greater US companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhilips, which maintain close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and which have been sidelined with the technical council in recent years, have failed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors in two of the contracts agreed this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, the oil ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said that China is on the way to become one of the world's largest economies and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can meet its partners and will fulfil its obligations towards Iraq.
For the pre-sale fee, selected companies submitted orders that were then compared to the fee per barrel oil that the Ministry was willing to pay in order to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Top planner of Al Kaida apparently killed in Pakistan
In an apparent US missile attack along the Pakistani border to Afghanistan, a top deployment planner of Al-Qaida was killed this week, as reported by representatives of the US counter-terrorism campaign on Friday.
This would be, if it were to be confirmed, the second deadly attack on a highly responsible terrorist organization this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities, were to be killed by a number of rockets that met their vehicle on Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North-Waziristan.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan's illegal tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a representative of a Pakistani civilian secret service from Miran Shah said by phone.
Locals who are suspected of belonging to the militants, rushed to the scene and quickly took everything that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. counter-terrorism conducted unspecified evidence that Somalia belonged to the dead.
Somalia was described as the leading military planner of Al Kaida, which led terrorist groups operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in swearing all over the world, noted a leading official who wanted to remain anonymous and referred to the vicious character of the US air raids on Pakistani soil.
Accepting its central role as given included planning attacks against the United States and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al-Qaida and turned them into operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. representative said that Somalia was quickly established in the Al-Qaida hierarchy and maintained better connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He must not be known to some Americans, said the second representative of the authorities, but this does not reduce the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death had been confirmed, Somalia would have been the second leading Al Kaida or Taliban leader who had been killed since September when a similar attack by Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal region, and three other top activists were killed.
The pace of the attacks by drones of the CIA has since summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a web site maintained by a non-profit organization, down from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline may be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their accessibility and at the same time brutally kill suspected informants, the site reported.
Head of UN envoys in Kabul Retiring
The leading UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his office in March, ending a stormy period of office, which was devastated by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-supported Afghan presidential election.
You go when Obama's government has decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the increase in troops, but he also expressed concern that the US military withdrawal timetable, which was scheduled to start in 18 months, could lead other NATO governments to withdraw their troops.
We need to accelerate the construction of Afghan security forces and thereby send the correct signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian aid to help with the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not lower his office, but only one of his family's agreements made in March 2008 to remain in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted to notify the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now proceed to make sure he has time for a replacement.
What I've said is that he's starting to look for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban, according to UN representatives, began looking for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he considered the Swedish-Italian staff of Mistura, who had recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and had considered the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who had previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eides position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September of preferring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and losing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all charges, but he also said that Galbraith's charges - which were fired - "the mission has certainly suffered damage because there was already a great deal of Skeptics in connection with international integration in the election".
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the assistance measures of US-led combat forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that the UN leadership allow its successor to appoint more staff from the United States and other Western countries who contributed to the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment about the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the current UN regimes had undermined his ability to bring in people capable of doing so.
The UN rules are so designed that since May, he said only one person could be set up.
This is a disaster and must not go on like this.
US Defence Minister Gates: Iran must count with additional sanctions
Defence Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers will soon be subject to "significant additional sanctions" over Iran because he did not participate in talks about his atoms.
Gates spoke during a 7-day trip through the war zones in Afghanistan and in Iraq to a group of approximately 300 US soldiers in Northern Iraq and played the view of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, there are no good options to choose, he said in response to the question of a soldier's probability of such a development.
"One of the things that lie in my soul is if we've learned something from Iraq in the last six years, which is the unpredictability of the war."
The Obama government is considering a sanctions package aimed at the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said that "a package of positive and negative incentives" was required "to convince the Iranian government that it is in fact less protected by nuclear weapons", because "his people will suffer indiscriminately" under the sanctions.
On Friday, an opinion by the speaker of the White House, Robert Gibbs, joined the American government in warning European top politicians that Iran must face "cruel" consequences if it fails to comply with the requirements of the UN Security Council and its Atomic Monitoring Organization, the International Atomic Energy Authority, with its nuclear programme.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should be gained only for peaceful purposes.
In discussions in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume the talks to restrict its nuclear programme and would reject a substantial part of its stockpiles in the exchange of urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has urged this kind of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and to earn time for negotiations.
However, since then, Iran seems to have left the negotiations to the provisional agreements -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership has no idea whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
The fact that Iran has simply left the international community in relation to some of the proposals which it had already approved in early October has made it clear that the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, has brought together in a way that it has never been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama set the 31st December as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including those that the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "expressive sanctions".
In a New York opinion, the Iranian representative of the United Nations condemned what she called on some security council members on Thursday 'unfounded and baseless claims' to the Iranian nuclear activities and said that they were ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers to "make an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who was supposed to return to Washington on Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he flew to the mountainous Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
The tensions between Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, especially in terms of borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates forced both sides to reduce the conflict potential to prevent delays in US plans, to reduce US troops by the end of August from 115,000 to 50,000.
Gates also tried to dissipate Kurdish concern over the upcoming withdrawal of troops. US representatives quoted Gates as Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, said: "We will receive your security, your well-being and your autonomy within a single Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A Change of Course in Older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that gave them talks that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain other children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
These lessons learned so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change the course and encourage young couples to have more than one child, their response was immediate and final: "No case".
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child, nothing is left, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with an 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of one-child policy in China, which has emerged from two generations of notoriously thick, derogated individual children, who are lovingly referred to as "small emperor", a population crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate is 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time of entry into force of this policy.
Division for Population Issues, while the number of population groups aged 60 and older in 2020 from 16.7 per cent of the population to the year 2050 is expected to rise to 31.1 per cent explosively. This is far above the global average of about 20 per cent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated people, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and olders accounted for almost 22 percent of the reported residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples must get into the productive age of babies to "help reduce the proportion of older populations and reduce the shortage of workers in the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- however not as rich -- as the industrial countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
In the constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy should probably be the most controversial provision introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Spouses who break this policy must face enormous financial penalties -- up to their three-fold annual rate in some regions -- and with discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese representatives have attributed this policy to avoiding the critical demand for natural resources, which has condemned human rights abuses in the implementation of the policy.
In rural areas, some pregnant officials who had already had a child have been forced to leave.
Many couples also had sex-selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards a child policy.
In 2004, they accepted more exceptions to the rule -- including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife were single children -- and the tone of many hard slogans was reported in 2007.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that government representatives recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children with a single child partner.
Shanghai was the first Chinese city in July to start an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
The posters, which taught families to have only one child, were replaced almost overnight by guidelines that detailedly describe who comes in for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city administration has sent urban employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and move information sheets under the doors.
She also asked for psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not just encouraging, family planning representatives said.
Discouragement reaction
Although officials from a small rural town in the external areas of Shanghai said that a rise in the requests of couples who want a second child after the campaign begins, the urban districts do not notice any change.
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, for example, only four to five applications are still per month.
disappointed Shanghai officials say that the number of births expected for 2010 in the city will still be around 165,000 despite the campaign -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Shanghai Family Planning Committee in the municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want to have any more children.
They want to give their first one the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that was legal.
But they have, like many Chinese, only a small amount of health and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say that this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West consider a child policy false as a human rights question, Yang said, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant in the seventh month with her first child.
Yes, we're robbed of the opportunity to have more than one child.
But the problem is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their delay.
Wang, the staff manager, said she only wanted a child, because she was also a single child. "We were the family's center and used to worry about each one of us.
We are not used to caring for others and we do not really want to do this."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it unmistakably.
For parents from the middle of a double career through which the birth rate decreases, he said it turns out to be a success and you have to be selfish about it.
The age group of today's 20- to 39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fighting during the early days of the Chinese capitalist experiment and they don't want a life like that for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, makes huge demands at the time of parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, you must already have a life course for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to do this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group develops emission reduction plan
The UN-funded climate conference -- which has so far been characterized by wild ponies and mutual accusations -- has again put a focus on the release of a document on Friday, which will record an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for the next 40 years, with industrial nations having to shoulder the greatest burden in the near future.
The text which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas management has revealed both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step in a negotiations that takes time, as over 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive next week in Copenhagen.
The text, formulated by a specific UN working group for this, is about the amount of money that the rich countries should give to the poor countries so that they can master global warming in a short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large-scale emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit value of the global temperature increase would be that of policy makers.
The process will provide great flexibility, according to John Coequiyt, the lead representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, has compiled a 180-page long negotiating text to focus on what the leading UN climate protection representative, Yvo de Boer, referred to as "the great whole".
It shows the basis for a possible agreement whereby the industrial nations together would reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent by 2020, compared with the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent during the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also given talks on Friday a boost through its assurance to provide $3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from the master of floods and droughts to the prevention of desertification.
The Friday, however, brought the same verbal fireworks, which had determined the discussions last week.
U.S. Climate Commissioner Todd Stern has rejected formulations that require binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries, if not financed by industrial nations.
This train announced that Obama's government is leading a harder line with China than the Bush government's representative not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without larger emerging emerging emerging countries and taking action, such as the star, who also complained that the text did not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Star gave his opinion an hour after the Chinese Foreign Minister He Yafei declared that it was either a lack of "reason" or a "highly irresponsible" of him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States of China would not help financially to master global warming.
Because the future economic direction of the great world powers is at stake, both within the industrial nations and between the industrial nations and between the emerging countries have broken lines.
The current struggle also concerns the rescue of individual economies, as well as the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States acting on their respective obligations, while poorer countries claiming that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the great powers were fighting for who should bear the costs of braking the greenhouse gas emissions, since even affected countries have gone beyond this, aggressively seeking to take into account the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions for their actions.
This is clearly a game that will develop a new economic dominance, such as Ulate, who is also a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most affected by climate change indicated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants said that the talks would best lead to a political agreement.
The Alliance of the Small Islands with 43 Member States submitted a 24-page draft contract on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who conducts the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensives of small island countries "practice political pressure on the whole political process," partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks received a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most open issues still need to be clarified before the government leaders arrive to reach agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister of the Environment, were blowing their aircraft and they ran through the halls of the Bella Centre to meet behind closed doors and press conferences to cover claims that will be negotiated during the next week.
The pure extent of the assembly -- 13,000 people go to the Congress Centre every day and, with guitar players playing night shows, where they are making fun of the countries that are betraying and selling their opinion, and hand-to-hand drafts are being developed by e-mail instead of hand-to-hand, it is already a challenge.
The intensity is building up: almost all important ministers are here now and from Wednesday will be 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We come to Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of Global Policy of the Organization of Conservation International.
The weight is coming.
Britain's first 225 km/h fast train defines the feeling of Monday new
On Monday morning, at 5:00 p.m., a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce an addendum that represents a revolution in traffic in the United Kingdom.
The first high-speed high-speed drive in the country will be 225 km/h to London St. Pancras and will be 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Dame Kelly Holmes will be on board the first Javelin pendler service from London.
He hopes that the new UK service will finally be connected to an international rail network faster, reliable trains and connect the large areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become living cities of pendants, working hours would be reduced radically, and the exchange of aircraft and cars on the train would reduce national carbon emissions and traffic jams on the streets.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fear of environmental damage could still bring the brakes to the British high-speed rails.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to present a feasibility study to the government, Lord Adonis will report on 30 December, according to the Times.
This gives him a detailed track map of the next planned stage of the high-speed network.
The new railway line to connect London with the West Midlands will pass with a five-metre playing space in urban areas and in places where the environmental impact is controversial.
In the open area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final route.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger, north-east leading high-speed network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is an Y-shaped route where a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would be shared in or near Birmingham and a drift would lead west of the Pennsylvania to Manchester and Scotland and another in the direction of Northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best functioning option," said a railway insider.
After completion, the trip between London and Edinburgh would reduce to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first partial route, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow the travelers to return the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared with today over an hour.
The drafts offer the train the possibility to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was designed so that 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can ride on it.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation per hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This would mean that in London an end station would be necessary, on which 20,000 passengers could be made per hour.
In view of the spatial constraints in the capital, an existing railway station is expected to be built to undermine the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not this plan should be continued, but the long-term public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken only after Parliament's elections.
But even if he moves the wheels, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains had to change first from the high-speed lines to existing rail routes in the north of Birmingham, which would keep the journey between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is a crucial turning point in order to ensure a change from the plane to the train, a direction for the rail revolution.
Tax payers come for mortgages for 75,000 pounds of order of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading under-house member of the conservatives, has taken into account the taxpayer per year thousands of pounds for the cost of an orange that he is building in his home in his constituency.
The prison speaker of the party, who was degraded by David Cameron because he complained that under-house members had to live "from lean rations", increased his mortgage by 75,000 pounds to build an oak-wood plant at his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to account for the additional interest income to the taxpayer, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
At the time, the sub-house officials approved the applications and they were also not asked by Sir Thomas Läg, who carried out a review of the expenses of the sub-house members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could be "not yet more clean or understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest under-house members, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have reached a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expenditure control post of the sub-house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he has grown a winter garden, which is called "orangerie" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "Glasshouse for Entertainment".
Duncan was also not invited by the Committee on Standards and Privileges to take an opinion on the increase in the amount of money during a recent study of his previous mortgage contracts.
The Committee released it last month, following an examination of its expenditure, on the violation of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of over 271,406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London house to his constituency, which he had purchased a year before his election as a member of Parliament.
This week's published documents show that Duncan received about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as a mortgage return by March.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncans RBS-Hypothek has not changed during this time, making it clear that the total increase was used to finance the collection of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal phaseless RBS hypothesis fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the Sub-House show that Duncan continued to apply to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month in this May.
Duncan lost his post in September as opposition leader of the Undercover House after filming him after he said that members of parliament would live "from lean rations".
"In essence, it means working for the state that you have to live with lean rations and how S***e is treated."
He said, “I have spent my money on my garden, and I am demanding a small part of it, according to what I hear.”
And I could have asked for the whole damn sum, but I'm not doing it."
The MP, a millionaire from his earlier career as an oil dealer, was first attacked for his expenditure in May when it became clear that he had asked thousands of pounds for his garden, before he had concluded with the Fees Office that this could be considered "as over-represented demand".
As a protest in Duncan Rasen, an activist dug a hole in the form of a pound sign, after becoming known that he had requested 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years away.
When he was questioned last night about the increased mortgage, Duncan said: "This was both done by the Fees Office and the following was approved by law for the increase in value."
He added: "There is no debate on deviations and lengths or a combination of rules or similar.
Everything is completely transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer."
Comes all your believers to admire Brighton's Strandhütten Advent Calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new content of life for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that stimulates spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on December 1st and visitors were allowed to watch the newest huts every day from 17:30 to 18:30 at free wine and traditional mince pies, filled with dry fruits.
The Christmas songs selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", while here the hidden decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Howe, is an honorary spiritualist of the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come to a strange old building? I think that the church should go to people and have exciting celebrations.
The idea of the beach-hugging adventure calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and living place and we are trying to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide on Saturday and in Copenhagen to seek an ambitious and binding agreement on combating climate warming, where the police have held several hundred arrests.
At least 30 thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands of organizers, are marched into the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion that could come into force from 2013 onwards.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the increasing mobilization in the world for climate contributes to what these demonstrations show that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incident in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, had broken windows with plaster stones and hammers, a journalist of the AFP established.
Anti-unrest policemen have attacked immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to your estimate, are mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splitter groups, who have already become famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in East France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has arrested the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters were "without distinction", sharply criticised, and stressed that about one hundred of you "were still detained on Saturday evening in the streets", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in position.
The more peaceful train went from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the scheduled speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators were driven by buses and trains from large European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with blue raindrops, have made a first run in the morning in Copenhagen, as you have followed the call of the Earth's friends to form "blue seasons" for the "climajustice".
Today we go on the streets to demand a recovery of ecological debt in favour of the south, Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen, explained.
We can't go on and tell ourselves: we have time, meant Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, where water flows can be walked, as has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, established in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalising critics has approached environmental organisations.
The European Commissioner José Bové, in the form of the Globalisation Critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asian-Pacific space, where many islands are at risk of warming, has given the starting shot for the demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people went to the streets, according to the organizers in Australia.
In Manila there were a few hundred people, mostly students marched in red and had hit bandanas, in which you have praised the sun energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, a series of hundreds of demonstrators took place to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" have gathered a few hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia complains that it is a "striking" here.
Abkhazia elected his president on Saturday, which happened a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as being self-recognised, Tbilisi denounced the "strike".
Some 131,000 people were called up to participate in the first election after the August 2008 Russian-Georgian war to control the South-Ossetian region, another Georgian secessionist area, recognised by Russia.
The lobbys have closed at 5:00 GMT.
The election participation was approximately 58% a few hours before the election closed, according to the Abkhazia election commissioner.
The first preliminary results should be announced on Saturday night on Sunday.
The five candidates, including the former president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically deny the idea of a reunification with Georgia that condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, said that Abkhazia is now under total Russian occupation, his press spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze, said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world is perceived as part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russia.
Having separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, with thousands of people dying, Abkhazia wants to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Lord Bagapch, has explained.
She was one of the electors who went to choose a hall in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees before the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs on which the Bagapch can be seen on the side of the Russian President and the Head of Government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is on the east side of the country, the District Manager, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhazia people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as a gesture to support Moscow, in particular with regard to the decision to recognise Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, replied and raised a glass of wodka.
The opposition, represented by the former vice president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised the agreements that were reached with Moscow in the previous year, as those in Abkhazia Russia left control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims neither to support the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated throughout the world on Saturday to seek an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, at any time ready to use, have held some 700 people on the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to the police, hundreds of thousands of organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which until 18 December receives delegates from 193 countries seeking an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to penetrate.
A stage was built to welcome the scheduled speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Some moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators who were completely dressed in black and were armed with backstones and hammers began to hit the disks, a journalist of the AFP established.
Anti-unrest police officers have immediately attacked you and assaulted you by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that between 600 and 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mostly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splitter groups, which have already become famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
On the other hand, a police officer suffered an injury by a brick stone during the incidents in which, according to the police, about twenty persons were arrested in the morning. Four vehicles were burned near a occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups in the grip," declared Police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the order forces were screaming in the air.
Most of the demonstrators who travelled by train or by car from German capitals, from London, Amsterdam or from Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in the blue raincoat, formed in Copenhagen in the morning after the call of the "friends of the Earth" to a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we go on the road to demand that the ecological debts be repaid to the people of the south," said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say any more : we still have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that win, there are watercourses through which one can run, which was never the case before."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of the globalisation opponents has approached environmental protection organisations.
The French Member of the European Parliament and Globalisation Critic José Bové explained to AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice." "There is no difference today between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The organization Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turns to the masses.
The Asian-Pacific space, in which many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given rise to an attack on demonstrations.
In Australia, about 50,000 people went to the streets following the words of the organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed red with bandanas, made advertising in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital for solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, during the demonstrations organized by the network of 350, several hundred people, especially in Paris, Marseilles in the South, Lille in the North, Bordeaux in the West and Lyon in the East, joined together.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
The fields of geography and history, according to Chatel, emerge strongly from the school reform of the lycées.
National Education Minister Luc Chatel explained in an interview, which appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du Dimanche" that the subjects of geography and history are strongly rooted in the school reform of the lycées, even if they are not taught in the terminals (12th year of school).
"The students of the Première (11th school year) now have all four hours and the same program," says Mr. Chatel.
For the Minister "must be overcome by this sanctity", because after him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but in large and large a concentration "the best students."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientist," he continued. He stressed: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who have been emboldened by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lycenes."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanities found that nearly seven of ten French (69%) criticises the state project of eliminating compulsory teaching in history and geography in Terminal S (12th school year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also miss this project, as well as the links and some representatives of rights.
The Minister replied that there was no question about the restriction of the philosophy of the programme of Terminal S.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) for Tuesday called for a protest against the project, which they considered to be the victim of the pedagogical training of future teachers.
The Minister explained that they were subject to Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year of a specialist fitness test and at the end of the year of an approval test, at which their teaching skills were tested.
They also practice during the year in the M2 and then teach a year before the students as teachers in the practice.
He continued: "If you add all the practices offered before the performance test, you will reach even more hours you spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the Minister stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in education."
He confirmed once again that he wanted to cancel the school card "by 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Superiore"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the use at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge Jean Jouzel, Vice President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to deal with at the Ecole Normale Supreieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris on Saturday morning.
As a journalist of the AFP observed, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, where experts turn to the public for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
One would like to do something to reach people and raise the feeling of wanting to learn more, Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, on the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the names given by the students to the fish in the school pool.
"Among the experts, the twenty participants in the discussion were selected, even after their charisma," he explains.
"You can talk about climate warming for hours. However, the core objectives can also be presented in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke only with the help of films before about 50 people.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in his hope that the listeners would like to learn that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos threatened by these conferences will be found online on the school side from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Payment delay : angry prison sentences, actions planned
The unions of law enforcement officials called for a general day of action on Friday in order to ensure that the awards and overtimes for which payments have been made for budgetary reasons until January will be transferred before Christmas.
The 2nd union of law enforcement officials ("FO-Penitentiaire") called on the employees who do not have a service to demonstrate and block them on Tuesday before the law enforcement agency to pay attention to the "threat of what is in their hands".
The 3rd union of criminal law enforcement officials ("CGT Penitentiaire") called for "to unite themselves to a strong mobilization in the various prisons", on which the non-payment of the overtime, night supplements, and the sun and holiday allowances in December is marked as "disgusting and unacceptable".
The first trade union of law enforcement officials, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The management of the crime enforcement agency and the Ministry of Justice stated that the overtime has increased significantly in 2009 and not all were provided for in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As stated by the Ministry of Justice in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie has sent a letter to the trade unions of law enforcement officials guaranteeing payment in the coming month.
"I know very well about the efforts of staff to keep our criminal system functioning and modernise," the Minister of Justice said in this letter.
"I have directed the head of the crime enforcement agency to take immediate action so that a situation that has arisen due to a lack of assessment of the overtime is not repeated in the future," added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
The December pay is thus lower, except for the management staff who benefit from high service and target premiums, the UFAP/UNSA explains for which the "beneficial weights" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal", the interregional FO trade union in Marseille urges and announces "all collections and calls" to boycott new directions.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and holidays when the hours of October are still not paid in December. This is also true of their overtime", FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
"In a time when we are increasingly tasked without more staff being set up, the attempt to enrich ourselves with the money of the staff is more than inadequate," says the CGT Association of Bordeaux.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
However, in any case it is wrong, the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget, states.
Obama’s view is that he shares Christmas gifts more and more than he gets himself.
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will spend the first Christmas with his family in the White House, has announced to TV speaker Oprah Winfrey that he is always giving better gifts than he gets himself.
During a special broadcast broadcast on Sunday evening on the ABC channel, the president and his wife, Michelle, gave an insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrative home.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family, will be with the party.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," confirms Michelle Obama and adds that the dog also receives a gift of course.
Michelle Obama decided to return her husband's claims to the quality of the gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she denied the president.
"So please," he scolded her and pointed out to First Lady's pearl chain: "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour exposure in an uncompromising atmosphere with the well-known television moderator, Barack Obama, who had so strongly supported during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts she loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bike with ten walks and also a basketball that his father had brought to him, which he rarely saw, from Kenya at Christmas.
"I remember my father visiting us once Christmas and bringing me a basketball," the president said.
"For the first time in my life, I realized that I had this ball from him."
First Lady remembered her doll house.
"I didn't even know how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved this little doll house," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL confirms that he was transferred to the artistic coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles due to significant "harms" after an operation in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was put into artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was re-operated from Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, after American doctors "damaged by the operation of a tape tape incident", which he had suffered in Paris on November 26, so his production company in Paris added that these injuries had made a new operation necessary.
The singer's production company, however, wanted to clarify the situation being "under control" and informed that a new medical opinion would be available within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, however, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "swelling and complications".
However, only 48 hours later, you had a little more certainty about the patient’s condition when he opened his eyes, added RTL.
At the request of the AFP, there was no confirmation or comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources", that after his first operation in Paris was "no more drainage".
The Rocker was operated at the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of a tape incident.
The surgery planned over several days was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday evening for comments to RTL.
After Johnny Hallyday's operation, the singer was delivered to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital on Monday in Los Angeles due to a subsequent infection after surgery.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, compared to RTL on Thursday, was the view that his friend went through a "deep valley" right away. However, he assured that he needed "no worries" to make the rock musician, since this was "a good fighter".
"He had called me before he got off to Los Angeles. I told him it was a fool to put himself in a plane for 12 hours after such an operation, which is not going to work," Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer Jean-Claude Camus confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well on antibiotics" and that "infected" was.
Mr Camus also explained that he had spoken with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had not felt any particular dismay.
Nevertheless, the care for the health of the singer has been growing since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he was knocked on his yacht.
Two months later, the general surprise was that Johnny Hallyday had a "small intestine-OP", which led to a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer took up his long " Tour 66" as a separate tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented out in detail. Fans and journalists have not gone away that the singer had trouble moving on stage.
First, in mid-November, the people surrounding him had to demente a new delivery to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Kurzbahn: First place for Bousquet about its favorite distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medal winner at the 2009 Swedish World Championships, won an international title on his favorite distance, 50m Freestyle, at the Euro-2009 short track in Istanbul on Thursday.
On the first day of this competition, on which the polyurethanes were last allowed, there were only three world records, while a true record flow was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn surprised over 4 x 200 m layers and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m layers of the men.
Damage for Bousquet, who wanted to take after the world record at the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the large basin (20.94).
At one of the two king's distances in the swimming, 50m-freestyle, the 28-year-old Francoise claimed in 20.53 sec. in a final with ten swimmers at the beginning (usually there are eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet forced the Croatians Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russians Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe more and more and more, and in the present case, if the world record is within my reach, I will try it."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane trailers, which are prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 World Records since February 2008, these combinations ended their Epos in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
The use of the combination has not been paid this time for the German Paul Biedermann, twice world champion in the basin this summer in Rome and World Record, at the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has spent the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danes Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I haven't given everything this time.
I knew I couldn't miss a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my job."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
USA : Zola dig plate estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman dig plate, which was calculated by the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated on Thursday at 1.5 million US dollars over its value, as the art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It comes from the 3rd century to Christ and has always been valued with 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of dionysus in a sophisticated architectural decoration, surrounded by satires and bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, Vice President for the protection of Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, on Tuesday against the AFP.
It was sold in hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still in progress, but this part is certainly what buyers have offered most of the time," says Sotheby's spokesperson, Dan Abernethy against the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of marble by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family home, after which she played pieces for pieces at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her Paris hotel bathroom and at Paul Reynnaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshall Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
When searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of a "Earse of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "therèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's Excursion from Honduras towards Mexico has been abandoned
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the disturbed Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic soils as no longer agreed, having rejected this guidance by the Putsch government as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place at night, it seems to me that there is a disagreement about the possibilities for this transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, explained.
According to the immigration authority, the plane which the Mexican government has set up in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of the transfer of Mr Zelayas was returned to its original location.
The Putsch government wanted Mr. Zelaya to be "thank you" and to seek political asylum for him abroad.
The President, however, refused this because he wished to return to Mexico as the welcoming head of state.
The Putsch regime "has suffered a renewed failure by wanting to give up on my costs (...), they wanted me to give up," said M. Zelaya on Thursday to Radio Globo, in which he has often reported himself since the beginning of the political crisis in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here well and like to stay for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the President-in-Office, who had fled to the Brazilian message of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under attacks of some agreement.
The Mexican Embassy has presented us with a request for guidance, but unfortunately we cannot accept it, since it does not contain a request for asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of Interior of the Puntsch government, told the Honduras Radio HRN on Wednesday.
I'm not looking for any country around asylum, Manuel Zelaya answered in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, as he had stressed, would only be the president of the Hondurasn people.
The announcements about a trip by Mr. Zelayas had mobilized on Wednesday the followers of the offended president, who had risen to the Brazilian message and gathered around it, which strengthened his use by the military there.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the position of the Putsch government.
This, in his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in the light of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was shocked on 28 June, on the day of the referendum organised by him to prepare for his re-election against the Council of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on September 21st and fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
If he abandons this, he will be detained for the sake of the High Council, to which he will be accused by the Justice, so the Putsch government.
The Putsch President Roberto Micheletti managed to organise a presidential election on 29 November in order to disband Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States in the course of the contested election, but was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress had voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his term of office on January 27.
Wall Street on the rise, the US trade balance nourishes optimism
On Thursday, the New York Stock Exchange concluded with a high, the figures of the US trade balance show a discount of the shares of the United States and its partners: Dow Jones added 0.67%, Nasdaq added 0.33%.
According to the figures at the end of the stock exchange, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 68.78 points to 10,405,83 points, the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, from 7,13 points to 2,190,06 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index was written with 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There are good news from different industries, determined Lindsey Piegza by FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market focuses only on "half-glasses", so she measured.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are focused on the figures of the US trade balance, "which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The trade deficit in the United States decreased by 7.6 % in October to $32.9 billion.
In contrast, the analysts had calculated a deficit growth.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The great novelty is the increase in the overall volume of trade, especially in the export of goods, reflecting the economic growth of the United States' main trading partners, said Christopher Cornell from the company research Economy.com.
In contrast, unemployment reports in the United States have increased in the last week against all expectations and have now reached the level of 474,000 applications.
However, the average value of new jobseekers over the past four weeks has been "falling at the bottom of the year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisor.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of State bonds at 10 years has increased to 3,482 % over 3,432 % on the day of service, the profitability of bonds at 30 years to 4,492 % over 4,408 % on the night.
Cuba: Hundreds of partisans standing at the power to blow "women in Weiss" out
On Thursday, some hundreds of Cuban-owned partisans met together in Havana for the purpose of the World Day of Human Rights and also banned another communication, which temporarily led to the arrest of a good dozen dissidents.
In order to ensure that the forty women in Weiss, wives or close political prisoners, were beaten on the open streets of the government's partisans under Raul Castro, just as they were on foot march in the centre of the capital to seek the release of the political prisoners, an AFP journalist confirmed.
Down with the Yankees!, "Söldner!", "the road belongs to the revolutionarys!", "We live Fidel and Raul!" the powerful partisans with raised Faust insulted the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilians who appeared to "guarantee their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "women in Weiss" had taken place in Havana on the night before, when it came to no injury or arrest.
On the other hand, in the Havana district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents were arrested temporarily by civil police, as well as the demonstration held on Thursday in view of the International Human Rights Day, confirmed by an AFP reporter.
According to this journalist, the police force forced the dissidents of the government to enter civilian vehicles by force.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As advocates at the 2005 Sakharov Prizes awarded by the European Parliament, the "women in Weiss" have an unauthorized march for the "Pray for the Release of All Political Prisoners", whose number, according to a dissident list of about 200 people, has been organised, Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda has been serving a 20-year prison sentence.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom up to 53 are sitting behind bars.
The Cuban authorities feel the regime's opponents as "söldner" or "agents" in the service of the declared enemy, the United States.
A rarity is that Cuban television reported on the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and counter-revolutionarys.
Cuba, led by a party of the Communist Party, is regularly accused of the suppression of rights and freedoms by European or American NGOs, in particular freedom of opinion.
Crazy kills eight-year-olds with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
On Friday afternoon, at the main business time in the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), a man with two knives armed with weapons killed an eight-year-old and injured five others.
According to the first figures of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the 18-year-olds for an unexplained reason in or before an apothecary at the Boulevard Jean-Joures with two knives and this, according to police reports, was in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, is reported to have suffered the consequences of his injuries in the hospital, according to a police union officer named Alliance.
In or before the same apothecary, he married a couple of pregnant women.
The man, about in the triangles, attacked and was injured.
The first two victims were seriously injured in the hospital, where the eight-year-old died.
The other injured swims in danger of life, since, according to police sources, vital organs were apparently affected.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and is expected to have been hospitalized in "shock state" according to a police officer.
The armed man, who seemed to be under alcohol or drug influence after police reports, was to develop on the street, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two other passengers, apparently by chance: one thirty-one and a forty-year-old, with the last of the two.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two meat knives, which he crossed behind his back, on the site of Arnaud Pressé, a head of the Union Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passengers, including young people, are expected to try, according to the witness reports obtained by the AFP, to stop the fools.
I've seen a guy in the tridents with a green west.
Three young people try to step in.
They didn't make it because the guy was well built, said Alberto, a waiter in a nearby bar.
A horn fell on him, he added, among them a city police officer who broke the wrist.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Journeys, at the height of the house number 61, two city policemen, including their leader, tried to capture the armed man and were injured with knives, so police records.
The event took place in one of the main battles of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are a number of shops.
Passengers have come to me to tell me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I put them in first aid position and noticed a striking wound in the stomach area, told Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacologist, the AFP.
Five minutes later a second person, about three-year-old, was injured by cutoffs.
The state police force finally arrested the man who did not carry any evidence.
The National Prosecutor of Nanterre has commissioned the district reference of the criminal police force Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) with the case statement.
The crazy guy was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been tried.
A police officer doesn't know that he's being delivered to a nervous hospital.
According to another police source, there were six policemen who wanted to arrest him at the police station in Clichy, where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of surprise" as "all mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces were released during the Tatherway".
USA: Polanski's lawyer requests re-establishment of prosecution
The French-Polish filmmaker's lawyer Roman Polanski has called for the repeated case on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States) to be prosecuted against his clients, who is currently in his place of residence in Switzerland due to a court-martial trial of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", has made serious procedural errors in the second district of California at the time of negotiations in 1977 before three judges of the Court of Appeal.
I asked for a sentence, Mr. Hummel, before adding that the behaviour of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was in charge of the case at the time of the trial, "let's run a cold down the back".
According to him, before the judge heard his case, he had been discussing with a state attorney who was supposed to have told him that Roman Polanski had earned a breeding house -- which is a serious procedural error.
This discussion was staged in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" (Roman Polanski: Pursued and Wanted), particularly by the state attorney David Wells in question.
Finally, at the end of September, Mr Wells explained that the authors of the documentary film were "blessed".
If the Court of Justice refuses to set up a criminal procedure, Mr Hummel is asking for the conduct of a procedure which would enable him to provide evidence for his argument.
The prosecution, on the other hand, repeated the evidence already stated in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the abolition of the accused's records cannot be taken seriously into account, unless Roman Polanski appears before the court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, even before the prosecution was announced because of "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old.
He hasn't travelled to the United States since that time.
The Deputy Public Prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the negotiations".
Would you like to spread the message on this issue, and not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused persons, who are a means of escape?, Mrs. Asayma asks.
According to your opinion, the filmmaker asks the court for a case and thus disregards its authority.
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to make their decision known – even pointed out that "there are other options to escape".
Hummel was not the only one who had applied for the imposition of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the abolition of the criminal procedure.
She reminded her client that it would no longer be necessary to be harassed by any recurrence of the Polanski affair and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years are enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on the occasion of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months in prison, he was sentenced to a possible delivery to the house arrest in his Chalet in Gstaad.
Wall Street is braked by the rise of the dollar and closed without a course.
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday without a course, in a market which between better indicators than expected in the USA and an increase in the dollar: Dow Jones won 0.63%, while Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
On the basis of the final figures available, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 65,67 points to 10,471,50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq 0.55 points to 2,190,31 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index has increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"Excuse me, the market is quite quiet," said Mace Blackxilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains strictly limited, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain the same until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators as planned, which " contributed to improving the market view of the solidarity of the recovery of the economy", analysts joined Charles Schwab.
In the United States, sales in retail trade increased by 1.3% in November, so it has already been two months apart and much more than planned.
Furthermore, the confidence of American consumers has improved significantly in December, at 73.4 compared with 67.4 in the previous month, according to the Michigan University Index Preview.
However, the indexes have been blocked by a new increase in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level of the euro for two months, thus pushing down ''the sectors that are vulnerable to the economic situation' said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost something on the ground.
The bond market has returned.
On Wednesday evening, the yield of the shadow loan increased by 3,540 % over 3,482 % and the loan increased by 30 years to 4,497 % over 4,492 % of the day ahead.
Election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month's tour through South Africa, the 112 candidates, entitled to Miss World on Saturday, will exceed the last stage to realize their dream: to be chosen for the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch this for a billion television.
During this great show of beauty, which will be held for the second time in the area of Johannesburg, five of them have already booked their ticket to the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were cut during her African stay to Miss Sports or also Miss Top Model.
This was a real waste of pleasure.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Kap Hoorn, were simply exceptional.
I've seen a lot of things and I've had every experience!," said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition takes place nine times in South Africa and will be transferred live on Saturday, from 17 a.m. (15 Central European Time) from Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, Ms. World Ksenia Sukhinova stressed in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russians, their second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the re-discovery of "surpassing landscapes".
After a month of galas, samples, encounters with the press and Safari, the miss now concentrates on competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to enter the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000, will also be present in this election, as well as Ashwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and were both Bollywoodstars.
Of course, every woman's dream is to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about the look.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in a wide smile.
According to the organizer, this 59th edition will be underlined with music and dance.
The candidates are defiling in traditional endeavors and not forgetting, in the bath suit.
The presentation is presented by a television moderator, the Chineseman Angela Chow, by the former beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean and by a director of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it is the world with little to overcome heart and pride, assures Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari, visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time it cost with the bike and the local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them his hand, was quite exceptional.
Not usually for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Their most beautiful memory, however, remains undoubtedly the release in Cape Town (Southwest) to the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to buy something more for this event.
I'm wrong with people I could probably never get closer to.
I'm sure I'll return to World Championship in 2010, promised Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday is according to his son David "very positive"
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive", his son David assured on Friday at his arrival at the airport of Los Angeles, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He's very strong, it's all going very well, David Hallyday explained the press as he stepped out of the plane, in which he arrived shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m.M.) from Paris.
The son of the singer, who made a relaxed impression, assured him that he would be "fastest" at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was sent to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following an operation on a tape incident on November 26.
The singer "this night in Los Angeles was put into an artificial coma to relieve his severe pain and to perform his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles to an artificial coma in which he was delivered on Monday due to a bacterial follow-up infection after a tape surgery on November 26th in Paris.
The singer had to undergo surgery again during the night from Wednesday to Thursday, due to the recent illnessal changes that occurred during the intervention.
His wife Laeticia took part in a school event in the French gymnasium of Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade went to school, a photographer of the AFP took part.
The head of the department for orthopaedic and traumatological surgery at the Pitié-Salpétrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the hospital on Monday in Los Angeles.
The producer heavily charged the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer in the Clinique international du parc Monceau in Paris on November 26.
We were told he set up the cleanest massacrer.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were completely upset, said Mr. Camus.
I heard you might be in court, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday "is too fast and this is traveling with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles".
I called this doctor personally, who assured me that he saw this trip as totally unproblemable, which I was surprised to see, because I had two tapes behind me myself, he added.
Shortly before, he announced at RTL that the singer would have left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without anything".
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artist's environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trentignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he had also operated the actress Charlotte Gainsburg to resorb a hematoma after brain bleeding.
However, he is also a doctor with a questionable reputation who has been convicted many times because of mis operation and not to be forgotten because of tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Chamber of Doctors, referred to him as "a man without scruples" who "regularly" was responsible before the board of directors and was "all other than recommendable".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux gave a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This explained that the intervention would be "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would be "normal".
The operation "does not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage", he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been practicing since last summer, seems to be in question.
It is quite clear from the hand that it is too short for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), Mr Camus explained.
The UDF Party (Union for French Democracy) will be energetic and the party calls for no longer to use its seal
The party alliance, monitored by François Bayrou's MoDem, reacted strongly on Friday to an attempt to take over the seal, once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, on the side of the chairman of the party Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and urged him not to use this seal on any document under threat of judicial prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, since he felt that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after he had reached the left hand.
The Minister of Defence, whose partner is the UMP, also wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In response to his efforts, he had received the support of Deputy Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now at NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, since he applied for this brand in 2004 at the "Institut national de la propriété industriale".
However, the business shares of the UDF party alliance monitored by François Bayrous's friends broke the silence and made it clear that they did not allow themselves to be discontented and set a time limit for the Minister and the MP to use this seal and transfer the property rights of the brand to them under threat of prosecution.
In the last few days, you have made numerous statements that you would suggest your political movement, take over the UDF stamp ++, wrote the party alliance in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem Party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centralist Alliance.
You might also believe that you have the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau center+, the slogan + of today's UDF+, on their political material and on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you do not have a right to use this seal, explained the UDF's headquarters and urged the NC party to "remove immediately the mention of the name UDF from all material and (their) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette was asked "to transfer the property rights of the brand to its legal right of claim".
If you refuse this, we will raise complaints against you in order to comply with the Act and in order to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they stressed that "UDF "has been a full political movement since 1978 and recalls that Morin and his friends "had made the choice" to leave 2007 to establish a competitive movement, as it had already done in 2002 to establish the "UMP" party.
The party has therefore no right to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française) according to the signatory.
They continue to recall that the last UDF 2007 Congress adopted the three-year accession to the MoDem Party and the establishment of a business centre to defend the "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the company continues, "it was at the time when he applied for the brand name, for three years now not a member of the UDF" but the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and deceptive way from the lack of the deposit of the acronym UDF to perform this for himself.
Furthermore, remember that this lack of respect is the best way to turn into a criminal offence, and irony the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us, however, in politics as well as in life more likely to make a name, rather than to try to come out of the anonymity, by making a name that is not legally valid in a deceptive way."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier is condemned for exploiting weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether he, as the billionaire's daughter Liliane Bettencourt claimed, had used a weak moment of eight years in order to make some of his assets difficult.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will have to be held accountable on 15 and 16 April 2010 for exploiting weakness before the court, a penalty that will be imposed with a maximum of three years' imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will in fact be a process in this affair that is worthy of the Saga of one of France's richest families, in which mothers and daughters are fat and at the same time have the fingertips of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
However, the 15th Chamber also arranged a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is conducted jointly by three doctors.
The Erbin and L'Oréal's main shareholder have so far refused to undertake such an investigation, especially under the conditions laid down by the State Prosecutor's Office.
The doctors appointed on Friday will present a report before 10 March 2010 stating clearly whether and when Liliane Bettencourt may have found herself in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to submit to these investigations.
I'm going to talk to her, the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt, Me Georges Kyejman, explained after the debate.
As far as the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner is concerned, he is very pleased with the court's decision.
This is an excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he (banier) manipulated this old lady who needs protection, he confirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has filed a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of using her mother's weakness for years to make sacrifices of a total of a billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
On your side Liliane Bettencourt had always refused to be manipulated by the photographers whom she saw as a long-standing friend.
Although the Court had to examine the admissibility of the proceedings brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the Playoyers of the lawyers on Friday led to a large family break.
So the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt called on three of his clients sent letters to her notar (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she was insulting the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please explain to my daughter that for fifteen years, I wrote to Banier once or twice a day.
Françoise, I've never been able to speak since her hierate."
The National Prosecutor of Nanterre is again of the opinion that the complainant had no right to react in this way, especially because a pre-mortem judge has rejected her application in the last days to initiate a judicial protection procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is completely legal, is not protected and does not have a premundum.
No one has the right to act in their place," confirmed the representative of the State Prosecutor Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The Court has now decided to give a ruling after the procedure for the authorisation of Ms Bettencourt-Mayers took place.
Manager revolution or the end of the strategic morning announcement?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence has been undeniably...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis consumers before the Marketing Revolution: It is the best thing for the staff to contribute "values" as it used to be designed for consumer products by the technicians in the work.
By giving the customers in the company's focus, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of acquiring the markets in place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separated Factors Customer preferences have to be imposed on a regular basis!
Demobilization of employees can lead to a deadly demobilization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tops of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all the company's intellectual functions, especially those of F&Eund, which is even more decisive, on those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) "of all the parties involved (...) calls for a proactive approach and a future-oriented approach"; it calls for employees to use a method that completely contradicts the instructions of the authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for an operational revolution that would allow employees to be equally entitled in the company's interest in the customer.
The very conditional benefits of internal opinion polls
Will the internal opinion polls, as the questionnaire that the orange has presented to its payees, encourage this revolution in relation to management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I was able to find that in the face of a new situation, after many reasons, the whole thing is finally going to be done... what it's always done.
Also because of authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power-proportional to the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most leaders have a very simple idea of human behavior.
Advanced from the major engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanical.
They take over by intellectual comfort the old behavioral theory recently reactivated by the American "Neurosciences" and was unmistakably widely distributed by research institutes and the media.
Thus and by suggesting that it is possible to act "Hebel" (sic) to engage employees, a current Le Figaro.fr survey published by Ipsos strengthens the leadership in a position to a mechanical control system that is inappropriate for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors
Instead, a business revolution that is necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies presupposes the adoption of a final view of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating a basic protocol into any discussion or practice of governance: for the recipient, the commitment to the company is only possible if it is clearly a means of realising a part of its dreams, ambitions and projects.
At the moment, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of motivation of employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a given doxa that allows them to estimate what it offers them to achieve their goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the management forces of companies can control their "social performance", predict and predict and reposition their human resource management in the right place.
In this way, they create a fruitful ground that is beneficial to the development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The speech of Oslo: the "right war" brings Obama praise to the right
On Friday, American rights welcomed Barack Obama's speech last night in Oslo and was satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "right war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives who had ridiculed Obama's award on 9 October praised the President's speech this time, following the example of the former Vice-President candidate in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, Palin explained that the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the daily USA Today and added that she herself had brought the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war into the language of memoirs published in her own.
Of course, the war is the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it's necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of violence; a way to explain his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, expressed the view that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former president of the House of Representatives, who particularly acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
Ginrich, who was questioned in the "The Takeaway" radio broadcast, said that this talk was quite historical.
The former MP, considered by some as possible candidate for the 2012 presidential election for the Republican nomination, said he was pleased to have seen a "Chairmen of the Left", who reminded members of the Nobel Committee that they could "not be free and not afford a price for peace if the use of violence did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and currently editor at Washington Post, Obama has "a very American speech".
In addition to being "cosmopolitan" as "he always does it", he said "as an American president", pointing out that Europeans "are living in a security bubble that they have not created themselves and do not do much for their protection," said Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a Falke of the era Bush, called the talk on the National Review Online website "long-lasting, high-end and inspiring".
To the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the retreat to the forces of war.
If one packs the war under the cover of justice, the massacrer can simply justify the innocent, he warns.
However, the press of the moderated left remains in favour of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which is still the view that the early Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama, called the address itself for a speaker like him who is known for his talent as "Monumental work".
The talk in Oslo "provides a final plan to manage international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression", says the California daily newspaper.
The New York Times believes that Obama "declared the necessary discourse" and refers to his speech as "distant and exemplary at the same time".
Distancer: Three marathons for an agreement that ensures the provision of Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the Road Association and the Tlf - the only employer organization that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday, which put an end to the strike command and the threatening heavy supply pass at Christmas.
At the signing meeting on Friday, the Secretary of State responsible for transport, Dominique Bussereau, welcomed the agreement launched on Wednesday after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second negotiation night, the negotiators separated early Friday morning in the hope of signing the agreement quickly in the early morning.
And although the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 till the conclusion of the agreement, and the agreement was signed only at 18:00.
The conflict "would have caused much damage to the company" and "was to fear that it would affect the holiday at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest pay groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages therefore rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"That's not very much, but we're starting to start small," said Patricia Clos (FO).
The activists are now told not to block the supply centres anymore.
"But there will probably always be some opponents who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
Tlf President Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "hard to justify these wage increases in view of international competition".
According to him, the increase of EUR 170 per month is for the low and EUR 100 to 120 for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on a healthy human understanding and respect for the employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), where Thierry Doine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) expressed himself in this regard "an acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides for an increase of 3 % in travel costs and for the maintenance of the General Committee for Road Transport in the first half of 2010, which will in particular allow the issue of the 13th month content and the modernisation of tariff agreements.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "the reduction of taxes on employers amounting to EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment to the Government's draft law for 2009, which was adopted at night from Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government calls for an "identical" vote by the Senate.
The Tlf signature allows the agreement to be applied first to the companies connected to this organisation and subsequently to be applied in the case of an extension by the Minister of Labour for the whole professional status.
This will be "in the shortest time" of the case, insured busereau.
The opposition of employers' associations can only exacerbate the procedure.
The FNTR association called for "misleading trade" because the 100 million euros "were already promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate as quickly as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but not to disappoint the Gans-Esser on the coming Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre Association, the agreement "is threatening to strike a large grave for the small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Unsatisfied this weekend, trade unions with the proposals of the RATP
The disturbances on the line RER A, the largest high-speed rail network in France for the Greater Paris and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Paris People's Transport Administration) allowed the strikers to continue with their demands for wages.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas, between 10:00 and 20:00, no trains took place. On the central track (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and one of four trains was ready for use outside the central track.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, which forced the travelers to cross.
The purchase chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "I'm trying to connect the major shops in transport".
The RER A line passes through the Paris Ballroom from west to east.
The section of the RATP connects the towns of Saint-germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of the two trains was scheduled for the main traffic time, and almost no one was able to travel during the low traffic time.
As already on Thursday, there was no human emotion on the railways, as the inhabitants of Île-de-France had responded to the situation.
As early as the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less overrun than anyone else, especially because of the lack of gymnasiums.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), explained that he would have been extra "one and a half hours earlier to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned to care for the travelers by staff and orderly forces, pointed out that there were no bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on line RER A or in the direction of Cergy-Le- skin came on or went over the Saint-Lazare train station to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, the main meetings of the strikers again took place, while the results were reviewed, which the associations, after meeting with the leadership, had regarded as "good" on Friday afternoon.
The RER CEO proposed the specific development of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (South), they are demanding a long-term pay supplement.
The CGT was encouraged that the RATP itself put its pay-up proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership point "is not able to solve a problem, while this was also possible for the remoters and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting on "wide examination of working conditions" was foreseen for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend runners".
On the morning of the morning, about 150 drivers were looking for the release of a committee in Paris.
Again it was the leadership tip that so far rejected any discussion during the strike, and brought together after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to extend to the RER B line after an announcement of Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations are asking for a salary allowance of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents). They also regret the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers are daily on the road.
The RER line drivers with years of professional experience refer to a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros, plus a salary of 600 to 650 euros for shift services, as well as sun and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court solves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the resolution of the pro-Kurdish main party of the country; a decision followed by the immediately angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens the work of the Government to be enormously difficult, which seeks to reach the Kurdish Community in order to put an end to the 25-year conflicts.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved as it became a "place for activities which are harmful to the independence of the State and its indivisible unit," said the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been unanimous by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to tie the resolution, and he pointed out that 37 of the party's leading forces, including President Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, had been excluded for five years from the political event.
The judge also announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity, the removal of Turkey and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party's property.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The leaders expressed themselves in favour of the ruling that the parliamentarians would rather leave Parliament than become partisan parliamentarians.
The decision followed a procedure initiated by the Turkish Federal Court of Justice Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya in 2007. He accused the DTP of following the "instructions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is viewed by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The party ensures that there is "no connection" to the PKK, however, refuses to designate it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court functions in the meantime as the Government seeks to oppose the Kurdish Community and to propose a number of measures to strengthen the rights of Kurds in order to ensure the support of the PKK through the Kurds and to put an end to the conflicts.
The DTP leaders confirm that a resolution could lead to a recurrence of tensions in South-East Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of the PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan had led to police clashes in the past weeks.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP's premises in the millionth city of Diyarbakir in the south-east, mostly populated by Kurden.
When the demonstrators began throwing Molotow cocktails and stones, the order forces put in gas grenades and water pumps.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
According to the ruling, Turkey assumed that the court's decision "to further deepen despair".
"Turkey cannot clarify this (Kurdish, etc. editorial) question on the basis of the ban on a party," he explained the press.
The government, consisting of a party that has emerged from the Islamic movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose in principle the closure of the parties.
This will not solve the problems," said Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedo of the democratic opening promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously react to the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK was known as an attack that killed seven soldiers in the north of Turkey three days earlier. It was one of the most brutal attacks of the past months.
The snow may break
A really silly winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to blackmail the citizens, the head of the FES says.
Especially so that his employees can test the entire vehicle technology and learn to control.
At the weekend it could be so far, according to meteorologists for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The ESF is in line with an accurate plan.
As soon as the temperatures are flat in Frankfurt, and the temperatures are below zero, 20 so-called A-ways will be completed with large-scale vehicles, Brauburger explains.
These include major transport and transit routes such as the New Way and the Hanau Landstraße.
But also firefighting, ÖPNV routes, pedestrian zones and routes with accidents such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometres had to be spread in a maximum of three hours with moisture salt, which is better held.
That is why the FES starts at three o'clock in the night, "so that the routes are free until professional traffic starts".
It'll be hard if it's only cut at 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is willing to make room for the electric vehicles".
Only after that, if it is not cut further, are the roads of delivery and discharge, which also belong to the road of the Council, on the line.
The last priority is side and side streets.
There will be complaints, bruburger knows.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES footmen are mainly cleared up on the way, danger points and transitions.
The FES can't take care of all the bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps the bridges in sight from 22 to 4.30 p.m., says Brauburger.
Since it is on these fast floors, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the stretcher is on the way.
If necessary, this will also be called by the police.
The Waves of the Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other meat-flavoring dinosaurs: the two meters long and 1.50 meters big animal ran on two strong hind legs, had a long shoulder with sharp, bent teeth, short arms with birch collars and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
But Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the Pangäa supercontinent on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window for early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us much about the relationship, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging at the Ghost Ranch in North New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones on one day, which is without example for deposits from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
During the excavation, they brought together the rest of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about Dino's early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional fund: "Dinosauri fossils from the Trias are extremely rare, most of them only find individual pieces."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says for example Martin Sander of Bonn University.
According to the current teaching, the dinosaurs first appeared some 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils, however, are incomplete, which is why the allocation of these ur-dinos is often disputed.
For example, the experts debate when the oaks split up into their three main development lines: the meat-flavored theropods, later called the Tyronosaurus rég, the Velocioraptor and also the birds, known as the "longhhelse" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the plants-flavored ornithichia (bird-beak sauriers), which included, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa Hallae is an original theopod.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
On the roof of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of airbags, as well as of the descendants of the Theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the airbags, the breathing of the birds is more efficient than that of the mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were also apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theopod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the huge Sauropods later also owned airbags and light-duty bones, the common precedent of the two groups had probably produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs have lived in South America, the researchers follow that the oaks appeared there for the first time.
Thus, the three development lines were already separated early and spread from South America across all parts of the earth, which were then still a single land mass as a supercontinent of Pangäa.
The fact is that the team together with Tawa brought the rest of two more, not particularly close related theropods.
The three cannot derive from a common, immigrant precedent, the researchers argue.
We believe that there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the Science Study.
Free there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonner Paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could be distorted because in South America there were only a lot of primitive Dino fossils left, while on other continents there was hardly anything to be found.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare line of the Reptilian strain to the dominant agricultural vertebrates of the Earth’s Middle Ages, it is still formidable.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their living space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying mammals and with many other oaks.
Towards the end of the Tria, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the relationship on the border between the Tria and Jura died.
The story of success did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that survived the dinosaurs by chance, but not the other reptiles.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever anyway.
150 million years later, a meteorite invasion of a group of animals to the flower that had also developed in the Trias and since then a shadowed dais: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors of University Toronto, University of Cambridge, University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Teachers from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police space of the occupied casino of Frankfurt Goethe University hit waves worldwide.
278 professors and teachers of the Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America are solidarity with the Protestant students at Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, "missible" it is the use of police by the Bureau.
Werner Müller-Estler, President of the Union, had the buildings occupied by students and teachers in the course of education in the last week to be accommodated because walls and works of art had been damaged.
Five students were injured.
The damage done by the signatories did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized educational events of students and teachers by a police icon command".
The room represents a "non-acceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism is "delegation and criminalization of the protest" and is derived from the contents.
The Bureau withdrew the necessary speech.
Doctors are calling for the immediate imposition of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the owners did not support the injury, that is.
Protest legitimate
The young men of the union Verdi and the German union club also cooperate with the students.
The protest is a more legitimate expression of growing concern for the future of its own, says Verdi-Landeswiendssecretary Alexander Klein.
Hessens Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of the President and the police.
We are grateful to the President.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have an understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, that is, the CDU agent Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, they saw the opposition groups SPD, Green and Left.
The CDU takes painted walls to the front to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (Linke) said.
Instead of dealing with the student's arguments and demands, we have been hiding.
The Left has tabled an application calling on the Interior Minister to report on police action.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, unavailable for Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital of Moscow, was a strictly guarded place for secret weapons research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is considered a "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production sites for micro and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted the Frankfurt Science Centre Riedberg - with the Uni-institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday now, Selenograd and Riedberg in Frankfurt signed a "Protocol for closer cooperation".
The Moscow Vice Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, who signed for Frankfurt by planning director Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural science focal point will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies are allowed to take foot on the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian science firms want to record orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large companies of Lemonics and Rossijskaja Electronics.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planning city" for weapons research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Grünstadt") received its name from the forested hillland where the research institutions are embedded.
Stuttgart Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not enough.
For the sponsors of the project, it is easy and easy to "the new heart of Europe".
Right. S21 is much more than the landing of a railway station, more than a monster construction project, which will collapse the city of the Baden-Württembergian capital for a decade in a hellless construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
At that time, main railway stations with rails ending in the middle of the city were considered to be transport fossils of the 19th century, which acted as brake blocks of modern rail transport, since it once took enormous amount of time to convert locomotives from the back to the front.
Step in, hold on, move on, so go on.
Therefore, the main railway stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a train station, which is about halfway across the trans-European rail highway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, is therefore the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have recognized that it is almost non-payable in the Hessian and Bavarian capital to implement the underground.
However, main railway stations have no more entry and exit problems since there are modern traffic trains with motor vehicles and tax cars at both ends.
However, Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE Neubaustrike to Ulm is now being approached.
National and municipal politicians have been through it.
The railway also carries the risks of the largest infrastructure single project of the Republic of taxpayers and not of the state groups.
The project can be justified to some extent.
It creates a new city space, which - you think you can use the computer-generated graphics of the planner - with a lot of green.
For the rail transport system S21 is harmful.
The train station and road construction are intended for passenger transport, which - typically 80 years of age - is attributed to huge growth.
At that time, there was not the competition of the airlines.
Modern transport policy, however, must be first of all to strengthen freight transport, as transport on the rail is much more environmentally friendly than by road.
However, the new track does not give rise to heavy climbs for freight trains.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly also leverages many other railway projects.
A total of six billion euros is to be announced in the Swedish language.
That's the official number.
Experts hold ten to 15 billion realistic.
In the next decade, the money will be missing at other nodes and docks in the network.
A total of 60 larger projects are listed in the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the well 180 km long track through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987 it has been built on the track at the time of the weather.
It would be urgent to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake lock.
The Rheintal route will be the bottleneck for international transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government examines judgment on the airport
In the Wiesbaden Landtag, the Government has made clear whether it is going to be audited against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) for the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to examine the more than 400 pages of the VGH ruling in law, Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
On this day, the VGH in Kassel had written reasons that in the case of the construction of the planned Northwest Railway in Frankfurt Airport, the country had to reschedule the night flight ban.
The permit of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as the Government provides, is not to be agreed with the statutory protection of the population against night flying noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it is against the judgement in the review.
The opposition criticised this upheaval and urged the representatives of the government to reject a revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD fractional chief Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel asked CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise, it should be considered a "word break".
It's damn hard if you can keep his word, Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir said in action on the FDP election logo "We keep the word".
Minister Posch withdrew the proposal of Schäfer-Gümbel, the country government was trying to get to their night flights with "right-wing and trickery".
A precise legal examination takes its time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legal resolution, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they represent the opposition, the statements of his group on the night flight ban were never.
U.S. Banks Pay Back Help
The crisis-stricken U.S. Grand Banks are tearing down their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the aid from the Tarp Savings Fund for a total of 45 billion dollars (approximately 30 billion euros) to a blow.
The Citigroup also plans to refund State aid after a report by the US envoy CNBC.
In this way, the institutions want to remove the restrictions that have been imposed on the adoption of the money, such as the limitation on the payment of managers and the provision of high fees.
The Bank of America had made good 19 billion dollars of fresh money to investors on foreign exchange loans.
The rest of the sum took it out of its own box, which, among other things, was well filled by sales of parts.
Banking chief Kenneth Lewis expressed his appreciation for the American taxpayer on Wednesday afternoon: the moneyspice has helped over a very difficult time.
The cash house had raised itself to the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the Investment Bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to obtain money on the capital market for exemption from its obligations vis-à-vis the State.
As early as Thursday, the U.S. bank could announce a serious increase in its capital of around $20 billion, CNBC reported calling on circles.
A Citigroup speaker did not want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their help.
Quick Select
But then it went faster than thought.
Almost two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had forced Chief Editor Nikolaus Brender from the office, the sender may present a successor.
Last night the board wanted to vote on the staff.
As a favorite, Peter Frey, head of the ZDF Capital Studio in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation from the sender of this - officially, so as not to prejudge the procedure.
However, they should also have played a role in preventing the ZDF applicant Markus Schächter from harming, and this proposal should not be implemented by the Board of Directors.
Frey, shadow candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the jury.
The result of the vote was not yet established at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schäger with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender to another five years, was defeated in the Board of Directors.
Only seven members spoke out for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's election was a bitter defeat for shadowers, one expected though.
As the majority of the Union in the Governing Council had already signaled weeks before the election, Brander did not want to confirm in the office.
The opposition was organised against the chief editor of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument, under Brander, that the ZDF's messages had been lost to active rates, he denied another term of office of the highly respected chief editor.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests, in which the political influence on the ZDF was debated.
Last but not least, 35 lawmakers have joined the debate, which considered the previous Cooks to be constitutionally contrary.
It's useless.

Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, teaching and Romanism.
After that, he worked at the Southwest Radio and the Frankfurt Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, first to the "Today-Journal".
Next stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the Chief Editor; 1991/92 Correspondent in Washington; until 1998 Director and Moderator of the "Morgenmagazine"; until 2001 Head of the ZDF External Policy; since then Head of the ZDF Capital Studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after Brender's election, which was elected by the media magazine industry on Wednesday, to the journalist of the year.
Koch's opposition to the Governing Council, the Rhine-Palestinian Prime Minister Kurt Beck, stated last week that the countries should amend the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that the applicant's personal proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, a withdrawal of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF also excluded Beck.
Brender's expected successor, Peter Frey, recommended that the Board of Directors take a smart look - by criticizing the board immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this record of journalistic independence, both shadowers could nominate him without loss of face for the positions of the chief editor and the board of directors, without suspecting a party to the office.
In the party geometry, Frey is added to the left liberals.
Study is evaporated
Part success for the students: After one year of the course of education, the minister of culture of the countries finally arrived on Thursday: at a meeting of the Minister of Culture and Higher School Directors, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions at Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
In each they agreed to reduce the test loads: in principle, each study module should only be completed with a single test.
In addition, the students' workload will be reviewed and "a realistic and representative measure" guaranteed.
In addition, policies and universities want to simplify the recognition of examination services between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural requirements for Bachelor and Master's studies more flexible.
There should be no different country rules.
Less Tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Ministers of Culture and Union Rectors have carried the flying word from the better studyability in the mouth.
Now it was first filled with a specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Board decided to reduce the number of tests in part dramatically: "Every module usually closes with only one test", says a 30-page paper that should partially re-regulate the approval of studies.
With the "significant reduction of the test load", said the Accreditation Council Chairman Reinhold Grimm, "the content should be offered for a "student development that significantly affected the studyability."
In addition, "Studyability" will be "the decisive criterion" in design in the future.
Modules such as content are "strengthening to check" whether "needless student inputs in the choice of
Events would be avoided.
The students would have "a claim to receive playgrounds to enable and promote their own initiative".
The rules should apply to the approval of new studies, but also to the review of existing studies.
These must be "recredited" every five years – however, which means it will take until 2015 until all studies have been reviewed.
There are ten accreditation agencies in charge of this, which are supported by the Accreditation Council set up by the countries.
The Ministers of Culture had called on the countries in October to influence the agencies so that the filling is not too large and the inspection regime is not too strict.
In each country, universities and universities with national ministries have already agreed on appropriate measures.
As a single country so far, Rheinland-Pfalz said additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
From the money, the universities will primarily set up tutoring programmes and strengthen study advice as well as inspection and foreign offices.
Countries and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to bring a novelty of the law to Parliament.
After this, only one test is required for the completion of a study model.
The study design is intended to be more flexible, as well as to ensure the recognition of performance certificates at other universities and to facilitate access to the master.
By the end of the year, all studies in the country will be reviewed on their studyability.
On Thursday, the government and opposition had once again argued about the conditions of study in the country.
But besides Lob, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Executive Board of the Juso High Schools called for the development of education policy to be no longer "closed" by the ministers and the principals.
At the latest, after the course of education, the students should also "meet a word" as concerned.
The future academics received support from the President of the Conference of High School Directors (HRK), Margaret Wintermantel: "We need the experience of students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture, with which the HRK discusss a common reform paper.
The Faculty of Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough: it calls for a legal claim that allows each graduate with a Bachelor degree to access a further master's degree.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that for the present generation of Bachelor-Students, there will be enough master study sites with the best possible study conditions tomorrow, according to GEW member of the board Andreas Keller.
The countries need to set up significantly more teachers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express their free access to the Master.
More than one footnote to Herta Müller
Going into Germany and out of is almost no control..." says the initial line of a poem by Lyriker Werner Söllner, in which he thematicizes the experience of a dissident who has gained freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's bookstore, before he moved to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he held the legendary poet lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the leader of the Hessian Literature Forum in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
For considerable extraliteracy, he took care of the last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, where it was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror of its security structures".
Apparently, Söllner left a statement in which he supported his cooperation as IM for the Romanian Secret Service Security, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the participants, Söllner had received the German Language Award in 1989.
The application trials had begun in the same way, first in 1971.
I'm, closed Söllner, "so someone who hasn't given up on security attempts."
The Lyriker Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and their unparalleled literary confrontation with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and in particular the community of the German authors from Romania are being shielded by a case that makes known the reasons and the downplay of a political system based on surveillance and speculation.
Werner Söllner is, as far as one can say according to previous knowledge, not only perpetrators, but also victims.
In his security act, IM Walter played a role, according to the opinion of the literary scientist Michael Markel, Söllner and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He's got him in all of the difficult points for him at the time, so Markel.
It was a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner's statement, however, was unexpected in the form and in front of this audience, and it is quite surprising that the recognition of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian Secret Service is not.
Germany was a welcoming reserve for security hospitals, Herta Müller had already written in July in the time after reading her own file, 914 pages.
The affected, so to speak, may be speculated and, in some cases, may have also known which name is clear behind the cover name Sorin, Voic and also Walter Burrag.
In contrast to the very procedural approach of the Stasi Acts in this country, it is still very common to deal with the backlogs of security surveillance.
A systematic clarification has been delayed and hampered in recent years.
One of the Birthler authorities of the National Council for the Development of the Safety Acts (CNSAS) was established only in 1999, but the issue of the Acts has since been rather detracting.
Only since 2005, there has been a law governing the administration of the files.
The fact that the influence of former security members in Romania is still very high, after the Nobel Prize was announced for Herta Müller, an interview in which a former security chief from Temesvar expressed his contempt for the winner.
She's got a psychosis, and you've only heard it once.
The infamy of power here meant to be completely unconcerned in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, the case of Söllner, as often in connection with debt, is inevitable.
Why just now? Who has been damaged? The apparent reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession hopes that the continuation of this chapter will be determined rather by knowledge than by debt and shame.
To the Genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who took the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation Supplement Champions League
It seemed as if there was a neatly dressed foreign servant coming from a very nice Christmas party, where a sports article manufacturer Goodies had distributed, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross went up a quarter-hour after midnight in the accompanied by an orange-colored plastic product of the equipment into a reversed C-class.
The man with the remarkable glacier let himself drive away because of the foreign city.
Otherwise he could have run himself - alcohol was not in the game at all, and the 55-year-old was just as busy as he was.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work goes on.
Or just let go.
In the words of the first three days of compulsory Swiss: "We have reached the eighth final", namely in the Champions League, thanks to the 3-1 success against the Urziceni Unirea from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The "much more important task" was ahead of Sunday.
Then it is applicable to repeat the royal class performance in Mainz on the League Day.
And to put down the completely re-discovered weaknesses after the fast three gates through Marica (5), Trash (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Justification
The eighth final of the Champions League (Hinsgames 16/17. + 23/24 February/ 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be released in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of the fulminant unit of the Babel successor remained.
Not only in the alleged cure, which had served the unsafe Stuttgart profession in the short term confidence, readiness and pleasure of the game.
I went to the players and told them that they should focus on their strengths, and I stopped them from being more courageous, explains the simple sounding success recipe Gross, which under Therapeut Babbel had no effect anymore.
He has invented a certain magic, gave Babel advocate Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes to football, sometimes things happen that would not have been possible."
And Sami Khedira, who progressed to the best player on the spot after a week of injury due to his dynamics, tried to describe the phenomenon identified with the word "fresh wind" and the new leader's way of working: "He is a man who demands insight and discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
Under Babel, it was apparently lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart is not about the mountain yet, warns Sports Manager Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart, however, needs a constant.
Like Gross, players and managers were also careful to overestimate the victory against a weak and completely overpowered defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil wake up, Khedira gave thought.
And sports chief Horst Heldt warned that although a season goal was reached, the other was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
That the hero on his 40th birthday even after his first home victory was not supposed to celebrate for three months, was at the events of the weekend, which took place freshly in the form of a television interview by Torhüter Jens Lehmann, broadcast immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that the others make, not the Jens, counted the harsh criticism of Lehmanns.
He had proposed to the board a weakness in leadership and decided to change his training skills on the pressure of puberty fans.
Even that his free day was cut to pieces, Lehmann valued as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and mistrust.
Lehmann's statements were "expressed by pure egoism", Held back and announced consequences for the final man.
You'll probably not be friends for life anymore, the two forty-year-olds.
However, they agreed with all the others that without the preparations by the dissolved training team, the playful and combative performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share of success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and also the man agreed with the plastics.
WM-Fight in weight
Hot Duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson world champion Vitali Klitschko has always provoked again with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended its heavyweight title by version of the WBC.
The judgment of the Court of Justice was delivered unanimously.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains a world champion.
The 38-year-old WBC team won the U.S. Kevin Johnson single-handedly on Saturday night in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
In the past, the Ukrainian was twice the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it didn't fit in with the K.O. that everyone expected.
Klitschko built his balance on 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice he had to beat himself because of injuries.
Challenged Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Bernese Arena, the 2,02 m big clitschko wanted to dictate the fight with his left hand.
The 11 centimeters smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, however, always withdrew the battles of the world master, so that Klitschko could not reach his dangerous rights decisively.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and tried only to get through the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beatings struck the world champion only rarely.
After all, he was only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of 12 rounds.
The challenger had taken care of some vertebrates before the battle in the main city of Switzerland.
He hit Klitschko as a "hate zombie", which can't be right.
On the road, the champion was then provoked on Friday to blow the sunglasses off the nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory to Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko also won in his fourth fight after his comeback on 11 October 2008.
After almost four years of wait, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered his WBC belt, which he had previously had to give up without fighting.
This year, he then forced Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States in September.
In this fight I got only one stroke and I am physically very good in form, Klitschko had founded the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
But the WBA belt is worn by British David Haye after it was removed in November at 2.13 meters by Nikolai Waljew.
Haye had given up a battle against Vitali Klitschko in the summer.
Apparently, its promotion company is already planning the fight against Klitschko at the London Wembley Stadium.
Kunduz Falls
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green-Fracion Chief Jürgen Trittin has referred to Defence Minister Guttenberg as a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
SPD and left require clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - Following the recent findings on Kunduz's air attack, the opposition Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor has been deliberately misled in Guttenberg (CSU).
The Minister told the deadly bombing of two tankers from September "scientificly the falsehood," said Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news release "daysview".
It's called land-run: he lied.
The killing order was issued in violation of the rules of the International Protection Group for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO had read, Mr Guttenberg said.
On Friday it became known that in the attack it was not only to destroy the stolen cargo, but also to kill two Taliban leaders targeted.
At the US air raid requested by German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, according to the Nato investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
Greens, SPDs and left asked the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to express himself immediately before the Federal Day and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel needs to clarify whether a strategy of the targeted death is part of the Afghanistan policy of the Federal Government - and whether the Chancellor, Federal Defence and News Service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green-Colleg Renate Kunast requested.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm decided to withdraw the criticism.
The Office did not influence concrete initiatives of the German defence in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, too, doubts were raised about the Ministry's representation of the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to the SPIEEGEL information, the two Guttenbergs have correctly and fully informed about the background of the tanker attack.
Officially, it had been said that they would have claimed the existence of the Nato reports and would continue to provide the Minister with sensitive details.
However, from the background of the two top officials, they stated that they had even referred to several reports, including a separate document by the commander-in-command, and a report by the Ministry of Defence.
Wichert will now have requested in a letter to clarify the situation, reports the "Frankfurter General Sunday."
He hasn't received an answer so far, that is.
The Ministry did not comment on the proposals on Saturday and pointed out that this would be explained in the Federal Survey Committee, which wants to be established on Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see pictures and hear voices in a watchful state that others do not see or hear.
Not only in mental illness and drug abuse, the boundaries between imagination and reality fade.
As long as it happens in bed, everything's fine.
If we are in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can give ourselves all the wildest ideas and imaginations.
However, those who experience traumatic conditions in the growing world see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered as crazy or drug addicts in the modern Western world, at least as special.
However, such pictures and voices do not only arise in mental illness or drug abuse.
We owe our imagination: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint images or write novels, ensure that the boundaries between dream, madness and reality disappear.
Traumatically altered alertness conditions can occur in the most different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case Wahn.
Even though triggers and effects may vary, the visions of mystic Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age Prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic depressive conditions, psychosis and hallucinations can be attributed to similar processes.
Halluzinations or faeces occur when the balance of the neuronal mucous membranes of the brain - all in front of dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is eliminated and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The gravity no longer has power over him
The relationship between Wahn and Dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle described hallucinations as a form of the dream in awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, in 1861 found a "great similarity of Irresin with dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was "a psychosis, with all the inhumanities, delusional formations, sensational alterations of such.
It is autumn 2001, when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and quiet.
The gravity no longer has power over him, he swims on the roof of the room.
He's feeling a tear.
Behind him flying devil forms with bluetted, twisted phrases, teething.
They chase him, they hit him with heavy, flaming sticks, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Voice, evil voices dries from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo system, taps it into a loop and fastens it on a hook on the deck.
He's up on a speaker and he's lying around his neck.
Run.
The snake's loose.
That's supposed to be a lesson for you, shout the voices in the drummer cor, "Go to the clinic and get healed!"
Today Henning T. 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last is back 2 years, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is called schizophrenic-paranoid psychosis, and he is manic-depressive, he takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The truck images are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in life from schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, affected people may no longer be able to distinguish between the inner and outer world, they are in an exaggerated state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
Especially widespread is the voice hearing - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Neither are optical hallucinations rare.
The affected person is unable to separate Importantly from the minor, the brain can no longer filter the disruptive signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the doors for a flow of ideas and fantasies that emerge from deeper consciousness layers.
The reality perception in the psychosis is subject-centred, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, an supervisor of the General Psychiatry Clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenia is located in the center of the event, everything has a meaning for it.
At the same time, he is in a passive role, he will, like in the dream, be overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrene therefore often feels threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality comparison is usually not possible for them, the truck images are cruel reality, excluding wake-up.
Once in life have experienced a hallucination
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality that is perceived in the psychosis remains in principle."
The crazy thoughts and hallucinations are in reality, the expansion of experience is taking place in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain beats caprioles, researchers still face puzzles.
Exceptional conditions can cause any person to lose the reality in a short time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
It seems to be a genetic institution for schizophrenia, but twinning studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the brain's neuronal rupture is disrupted at an early stage of development, due to a mother's viral disease during pregnancy, for example, Fuchs explains.
But there remains a challenge as to how the neuronal system is disrupted, which does not manifest itself at first for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for a psychosis when the mood is present.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis as they enter the transmitter system.
If our brain is running hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get what, says Lübecker Psychology Professor Erich Kasten.
It is often only a question of the position that truck images are found to be acceptable or unacceptable.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and triger appearances for ten years, in the last year he evaluated his results in the book "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Halluzinations are one of the typical signs of psychosis, but also of amazing many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s and mucous membrane trauma are often included.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brain itself senses healthy people.
Halluzinations, such as boxes, are composed of memory content, which are usually retained.
They arise when the brain is too active or too low, if our brain is hot or if there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also travel, stress, love or other mental exceptions.
In recent studies, up to one third of the respondents reported having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visiting the gym.
A very normal girl, actually.
If it wasn't for the pictures and voices.
In the pause it may occur that a smart boy with long, dark hairs will respond.
When he answers, the students look at it surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They keep the frightened girl for a relaxed day dream, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She's awake, she hears and sees these boys, just like she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
I'm crazy, she sometimes asks.
But she knows that this boy and the other truck pictures aren't real and disappear again.
At night the appearances are mostly scary
Often the truck images are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material, because the teacher in her eyes and ears just introduces a new fellow student, while he explains mathematical equations to all others on the table.
At night, the appearances are mostly scary.
If she waits in her dark room on the bed, which is too rare and too late, she often cannot discern whether she is awake or is already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees, the frescoes or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, come out of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at the shapes.
Parents and friends don't tell them anything that would make them crazy.
autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She's been living with her friend last year.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she's been in contact with the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she's not crazy.
Wahn is also an art work of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from travel sickness, he is very likely after a while of hallucinations, says Kasten.
I guess the brain is under-worked and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned with 13 that the man she calls Papa since she can think is not her living father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas that also process real impressions and sounds, people like Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish trump images and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "is in the brain, the reality is formed there.
Halluzinations are also images that allow the brain to arise, so they seem so real."
Also nightly dream images value boxes as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenia, mental health is able to identify their trophies as unrealistic.
Boxes therefore advise their patients to evaluate the hallucinations also as a special ability to evaluate.
Limit state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our highly conscious world, imaginary experience is mostly pathology, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor of Heidelberg and Chief of the Hospital for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also brings positive, creative waves - also a work of art from despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneroid experience, a special form of the traumaticly altered alertness.
Oneroides are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, which the experienced person holds for real and which he cannot in any way differ from the state of growth.
The oneroid consciousness status arises in traumatic or disease-related extremities, for example in polyradiculitis patients, who experience motor failure in full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by self and world loss, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening reality situation by a own, imaginary world that is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of border between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to deal with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is now under way in the imagination.
An intense form of sensational and singing in an unbearable situation that enables us to make our own design, not to go into a loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zürcher art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneroid experiences in his book "Herzvessel" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness develops after a heart beat operation with subsequent heart transplants on journeys, while his body at the Intensive Station is condemned for inability to move.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits foreign times and places: He experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the eagles, who produce the means of fumes from blood.
If he is dragged by a Greek on the motorcycle in his home country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the pines of the Alps and meets a Korean Mafioso.
He goes completely into the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These internal journeys differ fundamentally from every dream for Clauses.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are clear to me even after years and in extra detail.
Even more clear and intense than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience exacerbates the horizon of our other life experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
At the last end, oneroids, psychosis, hallucinations and drug abuse show how brutally our internal images of external reality are also in the wake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist box, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can be quite enriching.

Burda
Children should take over the publisher at 27 years of age
The new publisher Callen is an intermediate solution: long-term Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding is also expected to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children for a long time.
Both children are 27 years old and are determined to join the company, the 69-year-old told the SPIEGEL.
We have carefully arranged the details for this.
The question of whether they are active in the company first arises.
The question is, are they able to do that?
You can't introduce 7,500 employees to their children if they're not qualified enough.
This also kills the children and the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he withdrew from the presidency in January, and named Paul-Bernhard Callen as his successor.
The 52-year-old call has been a member of the board since 1999 at Burda.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury area, the responsibility for the company's assets came to bear and, after the expulsion of Jürgen Mordenhofer, also those for direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, therefore, there is no family member at the top of the publishing.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The name of Callen also serves to bridge "10, 15 years", says Burda.
The holding should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda said.
In view of the cases of Schickedandz and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family companies are not safe before the decline: "This always affects families that are stuck by a search for capital that have completely speculated and thought they could rise to the very big player.
My strategy was never.
He's had "no world power dreams," so Burda.
I do not see myself as the political president of this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to play with 'Time' in the World League, these stores have become too big.
Perfect beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and wellbeing is now available to you.
This is at least what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened up a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2m shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything revolves only around body care.
In the area of wellness, which is located on the eighth floor, you can find among other companies such as Hedonai, who provide for recreation with lasers; Spaxion, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; hairdressers Luis & Taci, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that represents more than 130 different teaseries through its teahouse.
A relaxing massage together with your partner and at the same time having a fantastic view of the capital, or for two hours renting the relaxation area to put your own "beauty party" with eight friends on your legs and then relax in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just a few of the many possibilities that Spaxion offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments and for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The fitness studio also has this type of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the customer training units and thus provide them with a complete personal training.
You start a training unit by entering a personal password on a touchscreen that is in front of the devices.
Then show you various videos how to perform your training units correctly.
The head of the fitness studio ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and decoupling) are fully sufficient to train the body muscles.
If you wish to take a look at the hair salon after you have trained your body, then Luis & Taci has a room in which you can be offered to your hair in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. 365 days a year.
The Most Various Decolletés
Christmas is getting closer and so it is a good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and get their solid clothes in our wardrobe.
The form of the decolletés, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points to be taken into consideration.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an overcrowded and very complicated decolleté. Of this you can only interrupt.
Endesa and Barcelona with the electric car
The power company Endesa has created the "live office" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE office" (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and enter into agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is to be developed to promote the electric car and to summarise the opinions and actions of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "Electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also participate in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework contract with the government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement would encourage the activities of research and technological development in the autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include activities related to energy and in particular to their performance.
However, it is not the only initiative to participate in the endesa with regard to the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and maintains a whole range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of peace" for the car sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, is a prophecy of the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's gross exporter, "a horizon of peace".
In presenting the economic report for the year 2009, President Zapatero recalled once again the assumptions that the government had launched to support the automotive sector during the government year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, today we would have a view of the neglect and the closure of some of our main production works," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the car manufacturers, even in Spain to produce in a very competitive industry, we can see a peaceful horizon for the future of this industry, which is our growing export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the competitiveness plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), provided EUR 800 million for projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also stressed the Government's commitment to the accrual of demand, in line with the plan 2000E, which will be applied in cooperation with the autonomous communities and car manufacturers.
According to the Head of Government , this plan allows gas to decrease by 6 % on average in the case of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, leading to a "strong increase" in the authorisations which increased by 40 per cent in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first edition of the International Classic Motor Show will be held, an exhibition for experts and lovers of the world of motors.
This exhibition will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in Pabellón de Cristal of Casa de Campo in Madrid.
On an exhibition site of 20,000 square meters, 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will present their brands.
Not only can you look down on classic motorcycles and vehicles, but you will also find all just Earthly articles related to the world of the motors at the ClassicAuto Madrid.
In this way you can find accessories, spare parts, components, fabric accessories, accessories, publications, miniature cars, etc. at the exhibition.
Hundreds of articles from the world of classical motors, which the collectors and lovers will enjoy.
Among the companies participating in this fair are among others Classicos de Mos and Good Old Times, vehicle sales; Juan Lumbreras, restorations; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and restoration of cars, specializing in Mercedes Benz.
Efficacy tests in the Auven area

Efficacy tests with classic cars and motorcycles are also carried out on a self-established race track in the field of the exhibition area.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally sustainable sport
Mazda wants to prove that sport is fully compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda has recently introduced the engine's automatic stop and drive system, baptized on the name i-stop, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
This second generation of Mazdas 3 stands out through its good notes in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its Straven behaviour, the mechanic, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" at the new Mazda3.
Starting at the front seat, you can find that the front seats offer an excellent ergonomic and good hold.
In addition, the game of the race is excellent.
In further consideration of the unit consisting of the instrument panel and the armature board, it can be found that Mazda with a variety of buttons and switches in the visible colors red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend is to a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us of the style of Honda Civics.
Therefore, it can be said without further saying that both the Mazda 3, as well as the Civic, both Japanese models, are separated from the nakedness of the German cars, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which all want to overcome.
The driving space of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than the appropriate comfort so that four adults can ride with the car too easily.
All of this comes with a rougher and clearly shaped suitcase room.
The stop and drive system is now only available for the 2 litre petrol engine with 150 PS and a 6-pass switch.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out by its fineness, by its quiet noise, by its performance and by its low consumption.
And all those who do not travel many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with a petrol engine because of its gross comfort in walking and low consumption, even if at Mazda the diesel models are mainly the most sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the sample behavior is a specialty, as it has a significantly larger number of elements from the series equipment.
From the series equipment, in particular, the driver for the RVM, which removes the dead angle, as well as the control elements for the traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive internal level, the board computer with a rough screen, the parking sensors, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and Audio Bluetooth, and the chromed 17-inch spots.
Furthermore, this version also includes, as if it were not yet enough equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for additional 1,500 Euros: in addition to other elements, especially the capable bixenon scanners and the sound system BOSE with CD chargers.
Error
The Mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best compact cars of its class.
It is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, due to its driving behaviour and the diversity of equipment.
Moreover, those who do not fall many kilometres a year can also buy the i-stop version that is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
The only negative on this model is its slightly higher price, which lies between 21.770 Euro for the luxury model and 23270 Euro for the tested sport model.
However, the Mazda3 offers us the new highest driving pass every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensitivity for Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine" the stars beamed, dressed in models that look just as elegant as sexy, more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, decided for a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is too limited to be able to read only his e-mails without any possibility of seeing certain attachments or surfing the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
It is more unlikely to see it on the street, but the idea of itself is above all for young people of interest.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek only costs very little and has a very favourable flatrate, for example only half the price of the flatrate of an iPhone.
Having seen the success, the company has placed two new devices on the market: one, which is intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free data service, in contrast to the peak, where you have to pay a six-fold higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and therefore its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, however, has prepared a surprise.
The monthly entertainment price for the phone, approximately 12 euros per month, includes roaming for Europe as a whole.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to ignore all the data in order to read their emails as soon as you have crossed the border or if you are looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with a phone).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly misleading and should have been possible for a long time.
It is already true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for foreign stays, but my experience requires a doctorate in physics and a good glasses to read all the little printed.
The repeated criticism from the European Commission regarding the available roaming tariffs for Europe has almost always been ignored.
Beyond your own country, you are always afraid to read your e-mails and that is right.
That a small device like FonPeek (but it is always surprising that it has the name Fon, although it does not have Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi) can offer this type of tariffs, means that the phone providers have to think about and start considering different options how they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example for this, in its prices the download of books and other queries on the Internet is included.
No vegregate and no hooks.
This is an Internet-enabled device and only one time is paid for it, i.e. at the time of the purchase, and not month for a month.
And that's exactly what I'm expecting one day from FonPeek, a shopping option with lifelong Internet access as it already offers the Peek in the United States.
And that's not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails on the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I believe it would be a more suitable model for consumers.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system once.
The Festive Colour of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already at the entry of Barack Obama as President of the United States, they appeared in a dress and coat of this color and once again chose the same color to accompany him at his, undoubtedly, second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: above that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow -, the clothes were made of three parts - clothing, jackets and clothing from the same fabric, and for that she wore something rough-shaped or a necklace.
Even so, at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes differ greatly in the type of fabric from which they are made.
At the opening of the office, she wore a dress made of top and in Oslo a patterned samt.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with semi-trailers and for the second time a modest model, but gold colors.
The hair was also different every time: the hair was high on this occasion as a hair cut, she wore the hair open on the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who want children.
This results in the study "Fruitality and Career of Women in Spain" carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9.737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt as to whether 75 % of women in employment see their career prospects on the labour market as a result of their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are gross differences in the decision to establish a family and the number of children, depending on whether women work or not, and if so, what kind of profession they practice.
Those of them who do no other work outside the house, only work half a day or have no fixed employment contract, will become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with a stable position, especially in the public sector, move to establish a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years of age have their first child on average only 3.7 years after the merger, a number that increases to 4.1 years for women with fixed employment who have taken longer to achieve this and who have brought it together and the first child has realized much later.
Also, the nature of work has a grave influence on the motherhood, although less than the calendar with regard to the reception preparation," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that needs to be taken into account at the age of the women in the hierate and the first child.
According to survey, the age is much higher at the time of the hierate and the first child, the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be found in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they have only the primary school or higher education, on average with 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time.
In addition, depending on their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While the women with the main graduation already marry before their first fasting period and have their first child, the women with a middle or high school leave turn around and first seek a fasting period and then get their first child, Delgado states.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name: Diane Kruger.
From the coming year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the widely known advertising "Because you are worth it".
The leading performer from "Joeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses at international level, will thus become another famous sign of addiction, like before her Linda Evangelesta, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her was the last to join this exclusive club, the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
For men, the cosmetic company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey ́s Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Sport College of Evangeline in "Lost").
The price of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today, met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
For this reason they all appeared.
The Ex-Model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger were chosen as the best model this year.
The poker game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, images by Fernando Vicente) the three-way X-rays of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fearsome genre (kurstbiography, life and work), but is looking for a similarity to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The trip is exciting and Vicent does not save on fear or enlightenment.
Aufér, that this book is a delicious reading experience, it is also a moving call to read and read again and again.
Here are some cuts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When I read his pages, I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual journey, just as I have always felt, without having found any words: joy in contrast to the unholy destiny, moral without guilt and guilt without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christ, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, had, between inpower and ignorance, with an overwhelming poetic humour, without any sense, like the messerling who almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was drawn into the arms of this woman with a passion which lasted for thirty years, in which the emotions in her flesh, because of the breakup of her marriage, were united with the pleasure of reue, a spiritual privilege, which was to come to heaven on the path of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in 1922 by Sylvia Beach in Paris. It is one of the 8000 peaks in the world literature, one has to climb up on the north wall, on the wall, where the best mountain climbers are always trying again."
About William Faulkner: "It was a comic.
He sometimes said about himself that he would be the heir of a landowner and once again he said that he would be the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams bore witness to a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the horrendous cry, which was drawn from a bridge out of that personality from Munich, so that his echo would continue in his literary way until the night of the 20th century. He made this on a journey on which he fled himself and with a speech full of violence in front of the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled down and prayed: My honored God, I beg you to do everything in your power to finally stop writing a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "In his grave these verses are inspired by Spencer: ' the sleep after the effort,/ after the heat of the port,/ the peace after the war,/ after a sat life you will find pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she always had her depressions.
The husband took it completely normal when she told him that Eduard VII was spying on the Azales or singing the birds in Greek.
It is not the only other case known where the man was so patient and in love with a neurotician whose literary talent was still much more gross than her madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do when trying to infuse Joyce in Baroja?
What would be the purpose of Benet if Baroja did not lead to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do without ruining the man's fame, so that he could put himself on this throne?"
Feege Aggression
My 70-year-old mother spent the last week walking through our town in Fuenlabrada, where suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 passed through her and our dog, our dog is a mixture we have taken out of the animal house and the one who weighs six pounds, and then out of the sky they left him two steps and hurt him hard.
Our equipment cannot be taken into account in words, as it is incomprehensible to us, because the fungus is supposed to be a small and helpless animal, which was carried out on the line of course.
To this end, the suffocation that a woman who was walking comfortably was given when she wanted to justify these persons because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a foolish person attacks a dog, he may also be with a woman, a child, an older man, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event took place in a normally quiet city district at five o'clock in the afternoon on a very usual Tuesday.
The dog's been healing all day.
Of course, we have refunded an ad in a nearby police station, but we still have great doubts whether this is going to be anything at all and in order to avoid any prejudices from the beginning, we would just like to make it clear that the fierce criminals were Spaniards.
Our equipment about the incident has led us to show this incident.
We cannot understand what must be done in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tire manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Institute for Transport Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote helm use, especially in the case of the younger motorcyclists, as both companies have announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, as this is ultimately the only protection element that can prevent head injury or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to transport security, which "is far more comprehensive than the design and manufacture of products that are becoming more and more secure with each day" and further confirmed that it also contributes to a step closer each day with other actions of educational and informative character.
This new campaign to promote helm use on the motorcycle running under the slogan 'To be or not to be' will be distributed in a first phase poster to over 500 motorcycle workshops in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that transport safety is "a constant care" of the company, and for the very reason that it is always committed as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles that one of its main objectives must be the development of ever safer products.
The sale of small cars is increasing a bit again
After almost two years, the car market for small transporters finally starts to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles approved in November in Spain represent an increase of 12,6 % in relation to the year 2008, and what is even more important is that they are the first growth at all after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to the figures presented by the manufacturer's association Anfac and the car dealer association Ganvam.
However, these good figures are currently only to be taken into account with great caution as the reference data for the comparison of November 2008 were a particularly bad year with a 60% decrease in the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total authorisations of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but in this number all of the vehicles from which the retail market consists include: passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small delivery cars and lighter passenger cars/cars.
Furthermore, the same weather clouds are still in the sky, which most of the demand is accompanied, because even though some of the vehicles are purchased by private individuals, the gross share of sales to small and medium-sized enterprises is going to be made in almost 100 % of all cases with third-party financing.
These restrictions, which are the consequences of the reverse debt of credit institutions, need to include other factors such as the increase in unemployment rates or the decline in the poor economic situation.
In this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the plan 2000E has not helped.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, even self-employed and small companies have a right to buy up to 3.5 tonnes of small transporter with a CO2 output which may not exceed 160 grams per km of risk, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam recalled that it was absolutely necessary for the State to focus a special attention on these small loads as well as, of course, on industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The car dealer association forecast time for 2010 is a year similar to the one just past for which it is estimated to be 19% with a sales drop (in passenger cars and parking cars).
Supporting Bremsmanoveren in critical situations is now mandatory
As already with the ABS anti-lock braking system and as it now happens with the stability control ESP, emergency braking aid systems must become an obligation in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all new authorised passenger cars and small passenger transporters, and for the rest of the vehicles a quarantine period has been set by the end of February 2011.
The European Union's adoption has the objective of improving the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help prevent many accidents because of their way of working.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical brake control, which the system recognises on the brake pedal by the driver’s brake strength.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to a survey commissioned by the manufacturer of components for the Bosch vehicles, one third of the drivers involved in an accident were no longer able to get on the brake pedal and half of them had not lost full strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the other hand, the brake aid reaches the brake system with maximum force and thereby reduces the brake time and therefore also the brake distance which a car will be leaving at the brake start.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented every year if all cars with this type of emergency brake assistants were equipped.
There would be even less accidents - one estimates that every fourth accident could be prevented with personal injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (by radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a light pressure on the brakes.
If the driver reacts afterwards, the system will help him increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the combination is already inevitable, the brake assistant shall exert the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors shifts the plan for Opel until January
While the Opel team in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) has already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April, probably on 8th, said Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer indicates that he needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants to see that the site concerned already has its consent to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, the final document, which will be presented to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be moved by the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that it will take a decision on Saab’s sale in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on American autobuilders to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM adds to contact with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skype sports car, which has the Russian group Converg back cover, is becoming stronger.
If none of these buyers were to enter into an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to sleep Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will also continue to be maintained.
In the control of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of its latest and very expensive jewelry, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and really made it easier to make it 80 kilos, making it only 1,275 kilos on the scale now.
In order to create such a thing, they refused, as the first one on the automatically adjustable roof, which was replaced by a ceiling wall with manual drive, so that they saved 21 kilos alone; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model, such as the GT3 "disappear" more 15 times; with the exception of the air conditioning system, a further 13 times; moreover, the fuel tank was reduced from 64 to 54 litres, thereby saving another 7 kilos; the installation of sports baccquet seats once again 12 times and five times with the light 19-inch traps.
Then, by abandoning the audio system CDR-30, six kilos less again and by exchanging the door handles, the missing kilo was reached by grips from the fabric.
Although it is also available with the PDK double-deployment gear, the sample gear was carried out with a vehicle with 6-hour hand gears, mainly on the smaller terrains of California, on mountain routes that were really very curved.
In his driving behaviour, you can only give him the notes without a taddel.
The reduction in its weight, however, has nothing to do with the fact that it would no longer be so safe on the Stravé.
It is rather the opposite of the case: for a long time we have no longer experienced such a small and light model, which at the same time also gives a feeling of great security at the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete to be able to make his muscles warm at a low pace in the necessary time until we give him the command to shave, slow, relax and then bring everything out of his engine again ...
He does everything you say to him. The car does everything we show him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to his drive, which is as communicative as precise as it is.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all taste directions
The sound of its V6 boxer with 320 PS (10 more than the Boxster S) is excellent and you can increase it with the 'sport' option as well as through a system that can change the engine noise, which has already been used for the first time in Panama.
The acceleration capacity is unimaginable brutal, regardless of whether it's out of the station or the renewed accelerator.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the land roads on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the impact holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire route; and though we found ice in some of these curves in the morning and roll break in the morning.
In summary, it can be said that it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pass, as it is probably more rare and has much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will come to the market in February 2010 and cost 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl.
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the Coco Cocoon cosmetic line and an opportunity star at the fashion scenes of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck stiffness as her pockets of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl" is a "Bag Girl".
The Basconia presents itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, an excellent triumph with 82-91 at his visit to the complicated football field of Maccabi Electra and thus comes to the first place within his group after Mirza Teletovic's massive performance, which was with eight triples of the best of his team (29 in the evaluation).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the major failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of use and teamwork, even if they were waiting for the bitter end of their victory.
The great hits out of the perimeter with 16 rated triples undoubtedly contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the Blaurotes, who from the beginning sat at the top on the display table.
Since the first four bodies of the team from Vitoria had already come out of the perimeter, one could already recognize that they had come to the field with well heated wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were primarily responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was almost different, only that the team from Álava decided to play an indoor game of Barac and to the game of Elijahhu, who was received on his return to the team with pipe and applause, which is his home to further expand its advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already started to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" evaluation of Splitter already indicated that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the obvious advantage in the break, the game was not yet decided for long, and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitoriars once again that not everyone wins on their field of play, and thanks to the ever-increasing "Hand of Elias" they returned to the game.
Eidson and Pnini strongly contributed to the "Gelben" turning the rudder (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured, but everything other than dead, had to prepare a few toy suits with meeting security to get air again and at one of them suddenly came the Mirza Teletovic's pistols, which with three almost consecutive trifles and with the support of English and Ribas, made sure that the display table again showed a refreshing distance of (54-67) that the host could be decorated with (57-67) at the end of the third quarter.
The Alaves were bluffed in the last quarter and already announced by English and San Emeterio (60-75) that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had earned in the first three and a half minutes.
Nevertheless, Pinni and Eidson, who did not do their best and tried to give their team power again by three points from the line (70-77).
However, and although splitter was set up due to fraud, Ivanovic’s team did not give up, it defended itself well and even though the Israelites were still up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time in this season.
Infringements prevented Unicaja from offering the bull
Unicaja lost a loud voice in Greece against Olympiacos and had to retreat the leader in Group B of the Euroliga, and that was in a game that was marked by the adventures of Unikajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the internal game, which made it easier for the Greeks to win.
The Málaga team was not afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship or of the enemy team, which may be one of the strongest Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their game offered in the first quarter, the Andalusian could begin to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the host turned 12-18 in the 9 minutes.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja era, even though the domestic team with an internal game between Bourouusis, Vujcic and Shortsanitis created that the ad in the 13th minute 22-20 showed their favor, the minute in which it would have come almost to battle between the two Americans Beverley and Williams, and therefore both were disqualified.
The Greek team began to become warm and its superiority over both parts of the game, while leaving England Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three mistakes caused by Carlos Jiménez's own fault left clear traces behind Unicaja.
Among its players in the inner field and Lithuanian predecessor Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their benefit in the 19th minute to 44-32.
An upholstery was impossible
The third game district was marked by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which proved to be superior despite his 19 losses and even managed to compensate for the difference in the game carried out in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn led the group to swing.
Unicaja tried to avoid the many accidents and the exclusion of Robert Archibald's wounded shots during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, in the 31 minute thanks to the springing and trifles of Cook and the use of Lewis, there was some hope again at 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was impossible to stop the Olympiacos once he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to raise the basket difference to 81-62 in the 37th minute and Unicaja had to beat himself and had to drop the lead on Olympiacos.
How much should you earn because of your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can now, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with most ads of properties, offers of jobs and cars in Spain, experience their value that they should earn because of their profile.
The "How much should you earn?" tool calculates the user's fees on the basis of more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. The user has a Facebook form that can enter their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
Just one week after the application was first available, the search engine found that the Spanish worker on average "slightly paid", explains Trovit, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spanish are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross amount of EUR 45.226 and a French 31.059, as opposed to EUR 24,000, which earns a Spanish.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net amount of 34.247 euros in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst work paid in Spain is that of a waiter with 11,592 euros net annually; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after places on the Internet in the last three months are a driver, lunch and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya’s stay in her message in Tegucigalpa.
The President of the Office shall leave diplomatic representation by 27 January 2010 at the latest when his mandate expires
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" woman had to leave before that date the message he had found since 21 September asylum.
"He is aware that he has to go on January 27th, as his mandate is going on this day and he has to look for a new accommodation."
The envoy also quoted the former presidents, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the appointed date: "My position is to go as soon as possible, logically with the government's recovery of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (with which Porfirio Lobo was the winner), Zelaya assured him that he would remain in the Brazilian message until January.
However, he tried to take refuge in Brazil this week.
This, however, failed to recognize Zelayas' refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeker who wanted to force him to "de facto" government under the chairmanship of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the last few days of the spring, in which the inflation of the assets was the dominant spirit on the markets, the uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is not surprising at all, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which the brokers make decisions about one of nature from an uncertain future.
The leverage used to stabilise the markets was to offset the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly to release the liquidity free hand at interest rates that were moving around zero in order to purchase the assets in this way.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are as good as finished and, without questioning their heterodox policy on liquidity, begin to pour something sand into the circulations, as the ECB has already seen with its annual increase next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox fertilisers, and we will be witnessing a change in the reduction of risk premiums.
The fluctuations of stock exchanges and the differences in company bonds are increasing again, even though they are still far away from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The States were forced to pay the private risks and the government's debt was rising again.
One is now re-establishing quality and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences in the eurozone countries in terms of Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability until now, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision below regarding the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not harm to bring the defenders of the moral risk to silence, who again tried to raise awareness with the world economic policy leaders of what they had caused, since they had interrupted the devastating effects of the restriction of loans to the loss of jobs when they had actually decided a new day to thank them.
Nonetheless, what has happened in Dubai is a tribal war between the Egyptians in order to restore power in the Emirates and development in Greece has already been foreseen.
A government that is deviating from public debt, elections and a new government that is drawing on the same line.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary will save from non-compliance with its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus a euro-member country will no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens with the need for over-ordinary measures in order to maintain the stability of government funds.
Yes, we are, as expected, before an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some delays on too high amounts, that would now be within the expected range.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt are increased at the same speed as European corporate bonds.
However, if European differences were to be reduced and the Spanish continued to increase, then this would be a special Spanish risk.
The standard & Poor's is a farce. While the above-mentioned indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to present their scenarios for recovery and to correct their scenario for 2011 above, including the OECD and the European Commission, which again comes with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this warning does not promise a long life.
Again, it seems that there is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although it is said in the moment "preview when driving".

The president of Iberdola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, met as the first yesterday before Parliament's sub-committee, where the strategy on the energy supply of Spain will be debated in the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán of the press gave some points about what he had put behind closed doors to the subcommittee.
According to the President of Iberdola, Spain must invest by 2020 50 billion Euro and another 60 billion from that date until 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this were not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60 billion but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdola believes that it should not be invested in increasing energy production capacity but in distribution networks and international associations.
The question will change from 2020 and performance should be increased.
Its proposal focuses both on gas and coal plants with facilities to capture carbon dioxide and, of course, on renewable energies.
In this case, it is assumed that 18,000 MW will be needed more, under which of course other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft law for a sustainable economy, which was just adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has called for, did not want to say anything against this law about how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be the opposite of all policy strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his view, "in the long term, it is clear that this direction, despite some "individual" practices, has been adopted, as described by the President of Iberdola.
As it is, Galán believes that decisions on investments, even if they are long-term, should already be made, as it will take some time and a stable compensation framework is needed to tackle them.
Ferrovial receives the "handling" from Aer Lingus on ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, the Swiss sport, is the preferred partner of the Irish Aer Lingus Flus company for the luggage service at ten European airports on which they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, to which no figures have been announced so far, shall be drawn up for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol yesterday to cooperate with the creation of an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The alliance plans investments of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to investigate energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Actiona competes with Hochtiv and Bouygues for its first road construction in Australia
Actiona fights for the approval of its first highway in Australia, a market on which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The building around it is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Supreme are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for actiona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and road operator.
The city administration wants to complete the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration for public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) had decided to run the project in accordance with a business plan set up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and wall management.
In view of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amount to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly from European construction companies, competing with each other in the last phase.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second with its seat in Italy, is one of the best construction specialists.
Against the team of Actiona, the Northern Direct consortium, formed from the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for the infrastructures and the French building group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium, which is in the closer choice, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Lightton (the subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtiv, which is also part of ACS), also the domestic building stone (in possession of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian market for infrastructure promises powerful construction and privatisations, however, has to overcome a hardness that it applies, as only through the purchase of a domestic construction company will you gain access.
A strategy which is followed by the above-mentioned companies, either high-end or high-end, in addition to Asian references, and which must only be followed by the Spanish construction agents.
Even ACS has gained access on this market only by its participation of 30% to the high level, owner of the mentioned Lighton.
Active Millions
Actiona is very important in this geographical area for the sector, where it is already well known for its activity as an energy supplier and in the discharge industry.
Among other assets, it has already grown its windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies that have been commissioned to build and manage Adelaide's discharge plant with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate itself in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the two areas of construction and infrastructure.
The underground road, supported by the Brisbane Infrastructure Office and being raised by Northern Link, has the purpose of connecting the western motorway in Toowong with the surrounding road in Kelvin Grove (see map) for a length of 5 kilometres through the tunnel. This is the rough road leading to the direction of the roads of Brisbane.
The roadmap issued by the city administration will provide the award for summer 2010 and start the construction work in December next year.
Even if this moustache is already to be opened for transport in the last months of 2014, it is expected that construction works will take place until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
He has two driving tracks in each direction, an electronic walling system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland participates in funding with 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million).
For Hochtifif, Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia is giving high priority, which yesterday signed a contract with the government of 154 million, and is still making significant orders.
The ACS subsidiary will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with glass fibre cable by means of its home subsidiary Lightton.
This improvement will create a fast internet access for 400,000 people and employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the King George Tower construction project with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction has not yet begun and has received 129 million for this.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investments amount to EUR 75 million.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has made use of its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometers long for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had received the grant for construction work to extend the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
This way, Alpine strengthens his experience in tunnel construction.
The start of construction work is planned for early 2010 and its implementation will take over 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore receives a range of ads from Renfe
Renfe has awarded the advertising and marketing services for the next two years by Mrs Rushmore over a sum of about three million euros a year, the railway company reported.
In this contract, there is also the possibility of two extensions of each 12 months. Ms. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies, who presented themselves to this competition awarded by Renfe, of which 4 came to the end, among them TBWA, who was responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be commissioned with the design and production of the campaigns.
Penalty over 63 million for France Télécom because of the suspension of competition.
France Télécom, the Regulatory Authority for Competition in France, has imposed a fine of more than EUR 63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to the Authority, telephone providers have restricted competition on fixed networks and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and trust programmes for consumers on the border of the regulation.
Together with this penalty, the former French monopoly and still state companies have collected more than EUR 560 million in fines since 1994 due to the disability of its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased, since the authority that is waiting for competition is of the opinion that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and has therefore become remiss.
Trade in application
On the other hand, the French company's subsidiary is following the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application page on the Internet to increase revenue from business that is not derived from the telephone connection.
In principle, this website is active by Orange in France and the United Kingdom.
Until 2010, we have to wait for this page to be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has introduced Madrid and Barça since the beginning of 476.4 million.
The Champions League has since its birth in 1992 developed a source of income for the football club.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476.4 million, which brings them the third and fifth place of the football club, which earned most of the money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The UEFA Champions League won, not only brings fame with it. It is also one of the main revenue sources of the major associations.
According to UEFA, up to EUR 5,362.5 million has been allocated to the 105 teams (of which 12 are Spanish) which have participated in this event since its establishment in the 1992/93 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The wife club is in third place in Europe, which earned most of the money through its participation and the only one who won the trophy three times next to the AC Milan.
The leading Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 is fifth.
The lists lead to Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also received most money through their participation in the last Champoins League.
And that, even though they lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only third of the countries that could take money through the champions, although it has more titles than all others (five, unlike four bis Italy, three with England and two with Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated payment allocation procedure used by UEFA.
In this financial year, the organisation, whose chairman, Michel Platini, has held, will receive 1,090 million by the Champions League.
From this money, UEFA 413.1 million is available for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the qualifying round (under the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Moreover, those who fought for participation received 3.8 million due to their blue presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they fought.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for an undecided (400,000 per team). The clubs that have arrived at the eight-finals each receive three million; the four who have arrived at the quarterfinals, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, in contrast to the second, which receives 5.2 million.
Thus, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and at most 31.2 million in fixed income.
Barça earned 2.5 million in August with his victory at the European Supercup.
However, the variable payments for which 337,8 million are provided are still available.
This money is given in proportion to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 allocated seats.
The master of last year receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third and 10% of the fourth.
The other part will be distributed depending on the number of games they play in this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The group of Nueva Rumasa yesterday had to ensure details of the purchase offer of shares with which it wanted to acquire a ceiling between 25 % and 29.9% of Sos capital.
A percentage that does not force it to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share, which is paid up to ten years and with an interest rate of 1% annually due to this shift.
Sos shares closed yesterday with EUR 1.85, which is why Nueva Rumasa evaluates the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects Sos's real rating again.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jeréz Group gives shareholders a period of 15 days to notify their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV ensured that it had not been informed about this offer, although Ruiz Mateo's company confirmed that it had contacted the Authority.
At the end, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, his management continues to be structured.
When trying to stay on the edge of possible purchase offers and the legal sources of his former manager, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as the head of the internal book examination.
A decision with which she becomes the first woman to hold a high position with the food company.
This is a newly created post, which is directly supported by the chairman of the group.
This is all other than free from polemik, because the company has developed into a judicial battle because of the suspicion of circumvention of more than 230 million sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos shifts further capital over the next few months.
With regard to Salazar's credit yesterday, the former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ágel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) arrived before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the movement of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves the public exclusion bid by the investment company Mer of Paterina
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public invitation to tender submitted by the investment company Mer for the exclusion of Federico Paterina on 9 October.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this invitation after it had been proved that the conditions of the law could be complied with and therefore the content of the document in question, as amended by the last 2 December, could be considered "adequate".
CNMV also announced that this offer for the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paterina at the price of 7.65 Euro per share, which is around 8.95 % of the company's capital, which consists of 6,142,786 Euros in the shares granted by Madrid and Bilbao.
Furthermore, it has been announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been set up which cannot be transferred in any way until the completion of the tender and whose price of Federico Paterina has been determined in accordance with the law.
New vehicle assessment programmes
In these days of disasters and accidents, not only do the KFZ workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles that have been created in an accident are dragged into workshops where a judge has to assess the damage caused and the cost of repair.
No single accident is the same and the calculation of the costs for the parts and hours of work can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between EUR 20,000 and EUR 30,000 per hand, including parts and hours of work, may take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest IT tools, it is a question of minutes
For this reason, almost 100 % of beneficiaries use these types of systems.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs shall collect the information they receive from the manufacturers to process them afterwards and offer their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American Group of Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all opinions are produced with their products.
The two other companies competing with the tool market for the evaluation and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is all but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales manager of Audatex, it is co-operated with 63 manufacturers and importers, each providing the information in a different format.
Moreover, the amount of data to be processed will grow to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have come into the market than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as a new car comes to the market, business starts.
It is a difficult task, as each of the thousands of vehicles must be catagolysed and their price entered.
In addition, each model creates a "intelligent" graphic image on which you can "click" various parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much sold model, work can be completed in one week if the procedure is in progress.
If it is a less useful car, it can take up to three or four months. At present, Auditex has 99.2% of the cars distributed in Spain with full information.
Among the exclusive models, for example, they have information about Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the road car park, it is more than 99%.
For the purposes of documentation work and the production of databases, Audatex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There more than a hundred technicians (usually experts for mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Auditex invests EUR 90 million each year in the development of these databases.
Each month they collect 2.5 million data and their customers get updates every second day.
The development of this huge flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and to offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are tools to manage scrap parts or to calculate the error or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about the value of the vehicles used in Spain is Eurotax.
Auditex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
In the review of the products offered by audatex, you can easily provide an overview of the type of support they provide to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, while the star of the AudaPlus products is a standard solution for the recovery of accidents for the audience.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
Above the cost of the parts, it contains the repair times or the painting prices estimated by the manufacturer.
This tool is paid according to the purpose of use, i.e. for each opinion.
Most expensive it will be for customers who rarely use it, up to ten times a month, namely 5,75 euros per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that manufactures thousands of opinions negotiates the price with auditex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it came from the mounting band.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle discs, and AudaSubbastas is an open-ended service on the Internet that can be offered for vehicles that have been declared totally damaged.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analysis or for obtaining information about differences in brand and model.
For example, it is possible to examine how many models of a particular car brand had to be put into the workshop or how many of them had been made into a serious accident within a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It operates among other Gt Estimate, which is also intended for customers and delivers digital images of the same type, access to shares or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group which was established in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, damage or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT leader for opinions is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 customers and 53 insurance companies.
In the last three years, its turnover has increased by 20% annually and by EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of the last year, they began to go to the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
On the other hand, audatex was founded in 1966 in Germany and was founded in 1979 in Spain.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business in Europe and the rest of the world are carried out, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work together with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.

Since 2007, they have been at the New York Stock Exchange and part of the Reference Index Standard & Poor.
Raising Car Accidents on the Internet
Last October, the Solara Autoonline group purchased a platform on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value-added services, allowing access to a huge international market.
This assessment and purchase service is exclusively used by industry professionals such as insurance companies, customers, car rental companies, workshops, scrapyards and car dealers who have to register before their activities.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of which alone in Germany.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 customers today.
Every day 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added on the Spanish market.
According to the Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose driving licence number has been registered must no longer be on the road, but certain undamaged parts may be used as spare parts.
On the other hand, cars with historical value may be allowed again even if they have been registered after difficult authorities.
Proposal for a workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost proposal in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for the spare part, creation and creation of a cost proposal.
The easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince older professionals who are normally more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 parking cars, 137 motorcycles, 78 small transporters and 44 trucks.
Of course you need a computer with Internet connection for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified by the vehicle identification number, a graph of the model will appear and then the required spare part will be selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for working hours, discounts or discounts and then he can print the bill and pass it on to his customers.
AudaTaller, however, is not a tool for evaluating such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that this does not include any estimated working hours targeted at the workshop.
The cost of use for this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can pay without further payment.
At the moment, the company Audatex is working to be able to offer these images in three-dimensional format as well.
This is an innovation that has been waiting for auto mechanics for a long time since you can choose a door with it for example and then completely turn the picture to look at the inside.
