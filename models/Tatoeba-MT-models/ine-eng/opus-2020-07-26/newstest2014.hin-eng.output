Black box in your car?
While America's road planners are struggling with the lack of wealth to improve the high-level system, there are many people looking at the solution in a small black box, which fits perfectly on your car's dashboard.
This device, which tracks every mile driven by the engine and communicates that information to the authorities, has been old enough to finance the major roads of today, and has been the subject of a controversial effort for Washington and the State Planning Office to reinstate the system.
In general, the hive plan has become a topic of deep debate and lifelong bonds, such as routine work.
The miles you drive, and possibly the locations you drive - and then the government have joined the libertarian environmental groups to allow you to use the black box.
The tea party's cool.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned by raising issues of confidentiality of different types.
While Congress could not agree to whether to proceed, many Kingdoms are not waiting.
They're looking for ways in which they can go in the next decade to pay for every mile on the road.
Thousands of motor drivers have already taken the black box for the test drive, some of which include GPS monitoring.
It's really a necessary thing for our country.
"This is not the subject of being chosen by us," says Hans Icharata, who is the executive director of the Southern California government, who is planning to start every mile that is set up by motorists in California by 2025.
There's going to be a change in the way we're paid.
It's professional to do that.
The main reason for this is that the country's high-trust fund has become almost a diaries, the cost of which is paid by U.S. citizens on the gas pump.
The Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Now the car runs more miles in a gallon gas.
There was no increase in federal tax in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Because of the high value of gas, politicians avoid even raising money in taxes.
Transport policy expert Lee Minich at the University of Minnesota says, "Gessing isn't really possible."
Their government has recently put a tracking device in 500 cars to test the anti-military payment system.
They say, "It will work as the most reasonable option in the long term."
The Wunks call it the Miles-based user shell.
It is not surprising that this idea is pleasing to urban donors, because it can be changed to make changes in the way in which to drive for example, which can help reduce steam and reduce greenhouse gas.
California's planners are looking forward to this system as they are developing strategies to meet the goals set by the state's leading Global Warming Laws.
But the president of the Home Transport Committee, Rap. Bill Schuster (A.P.A.), also considers the black box as the most durable long-lasting option.
Free sellers in the Regen Foundation are also on the side of the Mile payout by the driver.
Police chief Adrian Moore said, "This isn't the only thing that's going into the dark corner."
People are obviously paying more for what they're getting.
Two former U.S. transporters supported the campaign, who in 2011 preferred to move from Congress towards counter-mil payout in their report.
U.S. Senate approved a 90-million-dollar test project last year, involving 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of rural lawmakers, who were representing people who have a lot of time to go to work or go to the city, the leadership of Sadan concluded the proposal there.
Yet many kingdoms and cities are moving in this direction.
It has the most desirable Oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest use.
The drivers will soon pay the Miles Salk instead of the government.
Nevada has already completed the initial test.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Ilineis is testing with tracks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 group, which includes the 17 state transport departments with the previous cicboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), are studying how they can act on this change.
This idea was not supported in all places.
In Nevada, where some time ago 50 voluntary car drivers were fitted with this device, drivers were eager to think that the government could monitor their every move.
Alouddin Minn, who is leading the political and work-implementation management in the Nevada Transportation Department, says, "There was a major problem of concern about Big Brothers and other things of the same kind."
It's not what people wanted.
As the trial progressed, the A.C.L.U. of Nevada warned on its website: "To convert this device to a complete tracking device would be quite easy."
There is no need to develop a large, unregulated industrial framework-setting that needs to be expanded to keep each person's daily log of arrival.
Nevada is one of many states that is trying to get the same industry, with the help of the Kingdom to describe how many miles of cars are running every day, but not where and when it is going.
Khan said that if you can do that, people can feel more easily.
This researcher's research brought some government agencies to a small California Start-up called True Miles.
This form was not in the business of helping drivers by ruling in principle.
It was trying to get into a market that was going through the auto disease, where drivers had to pay for their mail.
But the device that it's testing was nice to the hive planners, because it doesn't use GPS and provides a lot of limited information, which is uploaded via modem at the given time.
"If you don't track people's speed and their place, they'll be more willing to take it."
There have been some major errors in these early Kingdom programs.
There are also very low cost and less cost-effective ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are using different options.
They can select a device from a GPS device or without a GPS device.
Or no one can choose to take the device again, but the average wage determined by the citizens of the state can choose to give on the basis of the average wage.
Other places hope that this burden can be sold to concerned citizens instead of providing less facilities in the device.
In New York City, transport authorities are trying to develop a taxiing device that will also provide a parking meter fee, "pay according to your drive" disease, and create a collection of real-time data from other drivers that can be used to avoid motor traffic.
The city's planning document states, "The motorists will be attracted to participation in this because of the benefits they receive from it."
Although some transport planners are surprised that the entire discussion on payment according to Miles is perhaps a big distraction.
The Metropolton Transport Agency in San Francisco has said that it is easy to deal with the problem of the Devil's High Trust Fund by increasing the Congress's gas tax.
The hybrid or other car drivers can also be fitted with one-time or one-year-olds, whose vehicles do not use much gas to pay for their proper share.
Randy Rentseller, director of the Foundation's Statements and Public Affairs, said, "When Esperin can work, what is required of the primary surgeon?"
If we do that, millions of car drivers will be concerned about their confidentiality and many other things.

The Indian team that was excited about the last match in the game last Saturday, when it will come down against Australia's seventh and last forest, will have to win with Syria.

Team India has achieved more than 350 goals in the series twice, and once again, the responsibility of the team will be on the bulbs.
The Indian bulb is now on the alert, and the biggest target is proving itself to be.
The constant beauty, the wind, the storm, the storm, and the great lion are in a strong form, but the young lion, Suresh Rana, and Ravindra Jadeja will also have special hopes for the team.
As a matter of opening, the team has received a greeting that makes it easy to use the rest of the bulbs as food and drink.
In Japur and Nagpur he had given the opportunity to play the game without any pressure, sharing in the opening.
On the third number, the Kohli has now been regarded as the true hope for the future as a reflection of what has been demonstrated.

Member of the Bozpa National Office and Chief Professor Dr. Zinthor Sinh said Pakistan is working on a new policy of alienating terrorists in the direction of this visible peace.

That's why he'll never be at peace on the border.
Pakistan is still on the verge of losing its position as a result of the collapse of the regime in Kashmir.
The leader, referring to Pakistani separatists' tour last year, said that ISA Chief Lieutenant General Zheir Ul Islam, the army, the Hafiz Seid and Seid Salahudin, believed that terrorism would be blown in 2014.
Pakistan has taken this promise seriously.
This is part of the policy of the suicide of soldiers in the border, of the sabbatical, and of the suicide attack in the city of Hiranah.
In such a situation, the leader, demanding the end of the army's privileges in the Kingdom, said that such words are not common until permanent peace in the Kingdom.
They get the opposite elements of the country.
They insisted that the military of the leaders should be held back from the emotional stories of the security forces.
Snow Dane is prepared to "share" with Germany on the U.S. Watch
Edward Snow Dane, the U.S. Secretary of State, has announced that Berlin is ready to travel to Germany for proof if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Kit Alexander fail to answer about their activities.
German M.P. Hans Christian Stro Belle met Mr. Snow Dan Seguruvar in Russia, where he was given a refuge to talk about the witness in Germany.
On Friday, a letter presented by Mr. Snowden, presented by the media in Berlin, said: "Although the results of my efforts are quite positive, my government believes that there is a change of heart, and there is no defence that seeks to criminalize the political speech with the accusations of crime."
Although speaking the truth is not an offence.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said that they believe that the international community can rule the US government to defend their criminal charges.
The U.S. Department of Justice is responsible for the theft of secrets and government assets.
Hans Peter Frederic, German Minister of Internal Affairs, told the online time: "Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to the German authorities, so we will find ways to make it possible."
The relationship between America and Germany is under pressure because NSA has claimed to have bugged Chancellor Angela Marcelle's phone.
Thomas Opperman, the members of the National Committee, keep secret information. He said that if Mr. Snow Dan Cossoon as a witness would be an opportunity to "debt the relationships with America completely and not bring them into danger," it should also be taken.
Mr. Belle, a member of the Green Party of Germany, posted a photo of himself with Mr. Snow Dan on Twitter.
He said that two German journalists were on their way to Russia.
Mr. Bellene said that, according to the former NSA's attorney, if they left Russia, they are not able to return Snow Den Russians.
If Snow Dan witnessed in Germany, he would be "safe" there, which would require assurances, Sarsad said.
Mr. Snow Dan said in his letter, "They had to face terrible and persistent efforts" and forced them to leave home.
Although he said that the world is happy and proud by the wide-ranging reactions "to his work of royal expression."
The United States and the United States, together with the world's citizens, have estimated the mystery of a vast public service overseer.
The letter expands a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities "when the problems of the human situation have been solved."
Frontier Airlines Cari - On Baggage
In Frontier Airlines, the plan is to charge $100 for equipment for passengers on your flight board.
Frontier Airlines is planning to start charges for $100 for a car - on-bag, and it'll put $2 for coffee or lunch, although Wednesday's announcement that travelers can keep a full deb.
The new Cari - On-Schulch Overhead is for bagging, so, the small bag below the seat will still be unplugged.
Frontier said that $25 would be charged if paid in Edvans, would wait $100 if the travelers waited to pay while they were at the gate.
Frontier Professor Kate O'Maili said that 100-feas travels have to get to care for the charge at Edvans.
"We don't want to charge," he said.
Airlines started the charge for the first and second check baggage in 2008.
Those who are trying to escape the storm fill as much as they can in Cari - On Baggage, which is in the overhead debbe, means that this debbe has a very low space.
There's a way to get less for travelers on the chess board.
O'malie said it wasn't really about adding the new charge money.
It's for the most loyal customers about Frontier that the search for overhead without has become very difficult to find.
This should not be allowed to allow visitors who buy tickets on their websites.
This means that the next person in the line can pay $100 for the same bag, while a traveler in the line on a frontier gate can get a bag free.
O'Milli said Frontier's website and check their processes are being changed to ensure that the travelers know it before they get to the gate.
The new Frontier won't start until the heat has been set, even if a date has not been set.
Travelers often reveal dissatisfaction with luggage and other bulkheads, but the air service likes them.
They argue that money is spent to manage the luggage, and those who want travel services should pay for it.
The baggies on Wall Street are looking at many as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
Most of them don't even have a carie-on-bag bag.
Spirit Airlines Inc. began the first three years ago, and his partner Allegiant Air later.
There is also Wizz Air of Other Airlines in Hungary, which Airlines consultant Sorensen said, and who tracks Add-on Faces.
He said that the Spirit's career costs $50 million in a year that was estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former middle-west airliner, recently flew into the Spirit and the travelers had to face an unusual bag of fish on the gate.
"The boarding process that I had seen in my airline career was easy," he said.
I was hoping to look out at the toothbrush and a battle gate.
"It was filled with candles and they said it was lyckety-split."
Frontier's also following coffee, tea, loose, or two sets of Spirits for Juice.
Frontier's good that any traveler who leaves, or Jus takes, can keep the whole debs, and this free coffee will only give for once.
It'll still remove the water.
The US Air Force tried to charge for drinking substances in 2008, but after seven months after the travel complaint, they withdrew and followed any other main airline there.
The travelers of Frontier's if they don't buy directly from Airlines, this step of Frontier's to charge customers to their own website is its recent effort to operate customers.
Airline pays an online Trawl vendor for a fee of $10 to $25 for every stolen ticket.
That's why all airlines have been encouraged to operate travels directly from those people rather than going through an online travel agency.
Frontier though, has gone ahead in this area.
In September, many air carriers began to spend half the distance of miles for customers who were bought from an online travel agency from these people.
On Wednesday, it reduced the Miles Ward to 25 percent of Trip Mile.
So an on-line travel agency purchased from a thousand miles of Frontier Trip would require 250 miles away.
It's also that they allow Frontier to choose their seat in advance for only travelers directly on purchase from the website.
There's a loyal customer base in the Denver of Frontier's home city, but it's getting less trade and it's losing money.
The decline of 9 percent in the kingdom and its capacity to fly has decreased by about 13 percent in the first trimester, according to the financial results of the Corporate Parent Republic Airways Holdings Ink.
Trying to set Frontier's money as part of the sales of the Republican Airlines.
N.S.A. accused of being a website crashing instead of hackers on "Internal Error"
Secret National Security Agency told Friday that our website had been closed for a few hours because of some technical deficiencies, not because of the hackers, as some people have claimed online.
The secret agency said in an e-mail address, "Today the night was not in reach for several hours of NSA.gov, which was due to an internal error that occurred during the pre-specified update."
Tonight will solve this problem.
It's not true that this obstacle was caused by the widespread denial of service [D.D.S.] due to the attack.
On-line server trackers found that the NFS website was closed for at least six hours, and for some users the site is not yet available.
N.S.A. spokesperson told the B.C. News that Agency's internal, sensitive network "was not fully understood."
The speaker said that no classified information is in danger.
At least one octavist group has claimed online that they are responsible for blocking the website of the NFS by the CDS attack.
The D.D.S. attack is designed to send traffic to the target website so much more until the site is closed because the server is overloaded.
This cyber policy is unexpected and the target of attacks does not differ from the internal network of the target system.
Formerly extremely secret N.S., which has never been called "No Agency", has been the subject of discussions and discussion among the general public about the events of foreign and domestic jazz events in recent months, which have resulted in a total breakdown of the former N.S.A. by the contributor Edward Snowden, after the destruction of the N.S.A. files from the Agency and after the release.
As a result of such a growing argument about Agency, such arrests have been made after the night event that the event was the result of a marked cyber operation.
At the age of two and today's contexts, a beautiful expression was presented according to the statement 'one and one'.
It has been shown that in today's debate, which links a teacher to the wrong path.
The concert’s tribute to the St. Joseph Inter College’s participant, the chief defiant master Walmick, the deputy director of the camp Aksid Road, the German Consul, and the power of the lion, joined together.
The drama showed the similarity of the violence of the Age of the Age and the conditions of a professor of Arvind at present.

Dropping into Bombardier's defence as an air dealer, crashing into commands
Canada's Airship and Train Meker Bombardier Inc informed Thursday of a 15 percent decrease in net profit, in its third trimester in its railway unit and less flight command and maintenance at points of access.
The Montreal-based Bombardier also completed its major program on no flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft from the release or the next September to the commercial service.
Almost one and a half months after the first flight of the test plane, it's only been blown three times, the question is whether or not the test phase is on track.
The result is lower than expected and has been sent to the Share Toronto Stock Exchange for more than 8 percent of the slide.
Cameroon Dorsen, with the National Bank Financiel, a analyst, has reduced his rating for the "area exhibition" on Thursday by one or two weeks.
"The major airlines were expecting more, we're clearly disappointed with margin' display in transport," Dorsen said in a client note.
We'll get a new command for Bombardier CSeries as the pilot program progresses.
Although, if no new commands are announced in the coming months, the market program is likely to be suspicious.
Bombardier is expected to be able to cut it at least at the end of Boing and Airbus' workshop market.
The first test was unveiled in March and the first flight took place for the first time in September after the latter month.
Possible Croatian New Jetliners wait for the results of a flight test to accept the company's claims about the south and potential cost savings, but such as the firm order for CSeries is up to 177.
There are 403 full orders and resistances available with 15 customers and operators.
The chief official Pierre Bodoin believed that Bombardier would meet his 300-year-old order target from the time he first used the jet.
The authorities assured analysts and teachers that the program was running according to the list.
"The test aircraft was on the ground for a long time," Bodoin said in a conference call, adding it to the ground test and software update interval.
Each creator makes a different schedule.
We decided to fly a first flight and an update period and said what we did.
That's why the flight program will be all over.
The rest of the five-test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, the company said.
Yet, analysts believe that customers are doubting that a CSeries aircraft can start operating after their first flight within 12 months.
Bombardier said that the service list (EIS) was appreciated and would provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow rate of flight testing -- although with Bombardier's internal index line -- confirms our idea that the service will be pushed into Q1/15," Dorsen said.
On September 30, for the third quarter, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million a year ago, or one sharer 8 cent, $172 million, or one sharer 9 cent.
The share is unchanged at 9 cents per share.
Royalty $4.2 billion from $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected to receive 10 per cent of the Sharer Cent, according to Thompson Reuters I/B/E/S, and $4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world said that a year ago, 45 aircraft were submerged from below 57 during the trim
The clean order fell from 83 to 26 flights.
The Eurospace division had $32.9 billion on the backlog on September 30th, no change since December 31.
"Eurospace, the results were on the line with our guidance, but the market situation was becoming a disappointment in terms of sales and sales, as a whole," Bodoin said.
A drop of 13 percent in the Eurospace state of 2 billion dollars.
Bombardier said the world's largest train manufacturer, the dollar 2.1 billion in the state, had increased by about 11 percent.
Commands in the transport unit were backloged for $32.6 billion, almost 30 September, from December 31, to December 31.
The transport department’s margine was also influenced by execution points in some major facilities.
The officials said that the new direction would be given in the fourth trim.
In the ranks of Bombardier, where Google Inc's chief financial officer announced that the Patrick Pichetboard was included, Thursday was also at $4.33 per cent below in the middle of the afternoon business.
Brazil's Embryer S.A., the third world's largest aircraft manufacturer, and Bombardier's closest opponent, informed Thursday of a 10% fall in profit.
New research has shown that we work with full honesty and dedication in the morning.
They don't lie to anyone, and they don't consider stealing or lying.
But in the evening, we change our mind, and we start acting against the rules.
Researchers have given a number of interesting facts in this research of the University of Harvard and Utu School of Business.
According to the research, we prefer moral values without working in the morning, but in the evening, fatigue or more pressure reduces honesty.
The resources used two for it.
He told some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people had to tell that the point is more to the left or the right.
Those who participated were told that if they answered correctly, they would be given money.
The experiment showed that the people used between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistakes and answered correctly.
There it was when people were used between noon and noon at 6:00 p.m. to keep their principles in mind and give a wrong answer.
The research has proved that the desire for money in the morning doesn't make any difference to our honesty, but in the evening we stop giving morale.
This research is published in the latest magazine on Cyological Science.

Mr. Bigg, the chief attorney of the Cocos, who has classified the police investigation.
42 - year - old ditta was reporting to the criminal Neal Scarboro in the kitchen
The president thought that people could find out about his secret cure.
Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison
The chief of the guard, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, because he was afraid of his secret medical condition, will be reported to the public for three years.
After the 42-year-old Drašta ditta broke down her choconine latrine, the cookie criminal Nile Skarboro provided sensitive confidential information on the examination of her sensitive drug-related activities.
He was arrested from his home in 2011, after a police surveillance operation in Skarboro, which he had represented in the last Narcotics Trail, which was named "Bish" and was praised by the criminals as "Top Brief".
The authorities saw Skarboro 32-year-old in Blackburn, Lukashier, holding three bags of cocaine in the courthouse, while he was out with his colleagues for the Lo Society diner.
After receiving the poison of cocaine in his teeth, his boots, and his credit cards, he found that teeth of category A drugs were "regular users".
During the eight-month period between August 2011 and January 2011, he tried to obtain incorrect information about the arrest of two people by Scarboro and his associate.
Lingashier, Cumbria, Mercesid, Berkshier and West Yorkshire were then being monitored by the police as part of the main investigation of the Heroin and Coconut Group.
There were 32 other people who were sent to heroin and cocaine at 1.5 million pounds during several printing operations by the police, and 200,000 pounds after the imprisonment.
The 42-year-old did inform the criminals, because he was afraid that people would not know about his cocaine leak.
The state law firm in Blackbank was facing a failure in two cases in Liverpool Crown Court after the trial for three weeks after the trial in the Liverpool Crown Court.
He had agreed to keep cocaine in his previous hearing.
The bad time of the lawyer began when the police found out when scarboro was checking that he was regularly on the phone with Dita since February 2011.
Two geese followed and saw him coming to the dentist's house and holding more than 60 percent of the fine treatment under the suit's ban in Black Golf Glove.
After the treatment was given, he was regularly on the phone with Scarboro Detta, who went out for dinner at the Blackr Rovers Football Stadium, in the Evod Park.
When the lawyer came home, he found out that there was a cure there, and there was a conversation between them nine times.
The court heard that he had found a "regular user" of cocaine in an examination of a class A class drug on dental hair, butua and credit cards.
Detta was subsequently arrested, but he refused to use cocaine and said that he was talking to the affected dealer, because he was his client and said that their discussion was about "medical privileges".
During his arrest, Detta tried to remove her wallet and many credit cards, but they were arrested, and her hair was sampled.
In police testimony, he said he was running his office with his place of work, and his clients were calling on his house for medical matters.
After telling the chief prisoners what Joshua knew about them, it was reported in the court hearing that the dentist was calling people of the supply chain, some of whom he had first presented.
On the side of the accession, Annie White said: "The criminal must be best known not to break the law."
As an offender on Mr. Dent, he is charged with using his position to connect more with his specific client.
We're not talking about the general drug dealer, we're not talking about the dealer who's supplying his drug to his lawyer.
Their words shall surely be established, because he is a judge.
But he's out of his range of legal clients.
As much as possible, he forced the police to remain able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Dentistry was not the honor of his business, but of shame.
He made more close to certain clients than some particular clients, especially Scarboro, and he granted permission to compromise his freedom.
Detta denied any wrongs and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to inform Mr. Scarboro, I would not wait for 15 hours, but I would do it right away.
But after the hearing, Lingashier Police Superintendent Lee Hallstead said: "When Mr. Detta began to get a cure from organized criminals, they turned themselves into a criminal criminal."
Because of their choconne's laity, they took up too much disagreement and became much weaker for the purposes of members of the organized criminal groups, who used it to obtain important information related to police investigation.
Residents must maintain the highest standard of faithfulness, and have faith and self-confidence in people.
Mr. Dent has deceived with this faith and tried to save his career.
The Lukashier's serious and organized crime unit examined Mr. Detta, in which they were held in Cocos and now found guilty of three cases of imprisoning the path of justice, which demonstrates our resistance to bring criminals to justice.
This thing must serve as a warning to the criminals, that no one is far from the law.
We'll find you and present you to the court.
Scarboro was sentenced to 14 years after he was convicted of offering heroin, cocaine and bungalow.
Fifty other members of the group were sent to Karavas for a total of 153 years for drug crimes.
On his website, Detta gave questions and answers about herself, in which he said that his fantasy job would be to become a lawyer for the death penalty client in America, to be their diner guest, and to be motivated by incompatibility for their work.
The press of Kenya on the disputed media law is acquiesced
The press letter challenged the lawyer as an illegality, saying, "This is a terrible place, and it is valid to ask: What is to prevent the lawyer's freedom from getting out of custody in the next morning?"
The Capitol Group - the most respected free radio station in Kenya and the news website’s company, the director Sires Kamau said, “This is law cruel and very repugnant, and we reject it.”
He said the new media court "will remain respectful, because it is part of the government" and said that banning content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
They said, “I hope the governor will listen to us, and we will persuade them to send the divineman back.”
According to The Star Newspaper, the new legislature will provide "hard control over the media", while The Standard said that the freedom of the public and speech in Kenya has been "intimidated" and cruelly told the lawyer.
This editor, in September, is being passed on as a means of strengthening national security after the attack by the Islamic Armed Forces in Westgate Shopping Mall.
The Kenyan media had released security camera footage, which showed them that they had stolen the floor in the south, and the authorities were angry with the Kenyan media.
Police chief David Kimayo sent two journalists and media activists to ask questions, even though the same was taken back after the media hacked.
In the midst of the new editor, Kenyan Shilling and various journalists can be sentenced to ten million Kenyan Shilling and, in addition to their "removed from the list" or the official press approval, will continue to be extradited.
The judge also has the right to exact the offender's property if the sentence is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "the majority of FM stations are sufficient to move the ground. "
He also said that these measures could have the destructive effect that Kenya is described as the "living blogosphere".
Politicians know that they can do their own thing by stopping the media.
Journalist Mutuma Matthew Kenyai describes the nation's public life as the main source of control and balance "no one will ever know."
They said, "When the kings are abandoned, they will certainly bring us back to life in a world filled with animals and birds."

The U.N. has set a new target for dealing with poverty
The United Nations is about to start work on a new target group, which will replace the development goals that were launched 12 years ago to deal with global poverty.
To replace M.D.D. in 2015, the Australian politician first played an important role in advancing the "Scienced Development Goals" that began in Rio de Janeiro during the night.
They were included in the final format of the document, which will be supported by the world leaders during the summit, along with the Swiss Gilead.
U.N. Major Ben Ki-moon said at a night summit that the time has come to "get up from national interests".
He said, "I am very pleased that member countries have agreed to start and take ownership of the process to establish the Global Sustainable Development Goals."
These S.D.G. will be based on our development within development goals, and will be part of the overall development framework after 2015.
I will try every possible effort to implement the mandate given to me by our member countries to meet our remote development goals based on the success of MDG.
Mozambique’s security concerns are fueled by individuals as a snare
With the image of President Samora of Mozambique, who was staring down at them, thousands gathered in Central Maputo for peace in a sad public demonstration.

The conflict between government forces and Ray Nomo has been reported almost daily for two weeks, more than 20 years after a peace dispute.
Ra Nomo was once a part of the efforts to overthrow the country's free government as a part of his efforts to eradicate the white government of Rhodesia and the colourful movement supported by the government of South Africa.
After the peace treaty in 1992, it became a refugee party.
Analysts believe it is not possible to return to the country's entire developed conflict, but recent events have encouraged foreign inputs and local people.
The dams are rising rapidly for the economy that can bring more than $50bn from some of the companies with Eni next year from the search for the vast nuclear gas storage and coal storage.
Since 1975, hundreds of Freelimo parties have blamed each other for the main political power, and Ray Nomo's pressure.
Ranom says that on October 17th, the government launched the latest attack on its members in the Sofa province, a traditional nomo fortress.
On the rise of the former rebels, the government forces attacked Renomo's sites and told Fonso Dhaka Ma, group leader, Fernando Manang, Financial Times to try to kill Renomo's publisher.
The government blames Renom for the trigger, charging the attack on the soldiers.
President Armando Gibuza has called for a lack of appreciation for the concerns about instability.
Mr. Gibuzan told the French news agency that Mr. Dhakama had seen himself as a "serious" "anyone who tries to prove to his troops that they can apply their own decision to the government."
Free Limo and Rea Nomo insist that they want to avoid war.
Mr. Manang was quoted as saying that Ree Nomo had abolished the peace dispute in 1992 but later became a matter of concern.
They're telling FT what the conflict is not being respected by Free Limo.
Our eyes must come back for the conversation, but seriously," said Mr. Mangane.
The last conversation between the two sides did nothing to reduce the six-string tension of this year's conflict.
"It's about two big men fighting together," Joseph Han of London said in an explanation and a Mozambiqueian expert at the University of London.
Some of them aren't good speakers, and some of them don't have to be ready to create the kind of puzzles.
Re Nomo, insisting on the election for improvements, said about the expulsion of the city's corporate elections in November.
President and presidential election are set for next year.
Some commentators have explained their use of force as a patient's attempt to win the government's profits and economic losses.
Ree Nomo's membership in Tedan is falling since 1992, while a new party, a former Ree Nomo member, is expected to improve its display in the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) in elections.
Mr. Manang says Mr. Gibuzanko -- who left office at the end of his second term -- wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want a multicultural democracy, he doesn't want to leave the presidency because he doesn't want peace, he doesn't want a transparent choice," said Mr. Manang.
The capacity of Ree Nomo has not been clarified, but it's a major one on the south highway of the police stations and vehicles that they've been doing around hot and running.
The majority of the bats are located in the province of Nea, at a distance of hundreds of kilometres north of Jomaputo, which has a host beer port that trusts to export coal with Rio Tinto and the valley.
After threatening to attack the Renom line, the Russians suspended their use for about a week in June.
Renom would have doubled this risk or not was Mr. Mangovine on almost being questioned.

Children should be taught "as a model for a way of writing life" by myths and myths.
The stories of the Great One could show "The Crusades are no match for all the tricks," while the importance of a dream in the Cherian continents is evident.
Many of the myths will also not be useful for teaching "disgusting far away even in Vanuatu and in some cases in sexual and academic matters," Cross Lee Holland said a "warning choice" of age.
"I think it's amazing, in the United States, that myth and democracy are already part of the area of education," he said.
I'm defending it as a plan for twenty years.
He told the authors and the teachers "major," and it's "a new turn" for the children, as well as "presenting the messages in entertaining stories."
Cross Lee Holland, who translated from Anglo-Saxon, Biowulf, together with Norwegian myths and British people wrote the Penguins' stories, said: "Your intentions may be very much, but it would be better to keep it out of sight."

Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
People can argue that the New York City is the birthplace of the Standup comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, Hashi filmmaker Frank Fe, who worked as a festival master in the Pales Theatre, began to hear the crowd’s conversation in a straight tone.
Fae's search has expanded over the years, at the latest, in the New York Comedy Fostival.
This year's 10th anniversary, which included more than six shows in small clubs and big theaters, was celebrated and celebrated by Caroline Harsh, the founder of the Standard Up Organisation called Carolines.
Harsh says, "Most of them were seen in headliners in Carolines, and they became very successful, to the extent that they became very large to be played at the club."
We created this celebration as a way to continue working with them.
This year's program includes the presence of Wanda Sykes, Katie Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the annual music and comedy benefits for military service in Madison Square Garden, "Stand Up for Heir", which included other artists including Bruce Springstein, John Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.
The world of comedy has expanded as well as the expansion of the celebration.
Many who participate in this year's celebration have come from non-traditional comedians, such as comedy Central, F.X., and Spyk, coming to a small network.
Nick Kroll, from the DP Cable Sitcom (F.X.X., by contrast, ranchi fantasy-football theme, "The League", and now their own comedy central ski show.
Jenny Slate is a member of the "Saturde Night Live" and "Parks and Recovery", although they are best known for their Various Video Series "Marsel The Shell Wid Shuez On."
Other young comedians, including Crowd and Slate, who have different voices, are the products of American comedy.
Among the main attractions of the celebration will be a witness: Talking to Larry David of David Stinburg:
Stinburg had started working as a Standup comedian, but they have become nominal TV and film directors, as well as illegal comedy historians.
From 2005 to 2007, they hosted a show called "Site Down Comedy Vid David Steinberg" on the TV Land.
This meeting will be in the center of Manhattan, Town Hall.
Stinberg said, "The city is definitely in the comedy of all the activities of Larry, N.A.."

Oil fell to $96 per barrel
A report on the cost of oil continued to fall on Friday as a matter of concern, where the hunger for power building is being strengthened in China.
For December, Benchmark, the United States of America, was down 14 cents in electronic trading on New York Mercantile Exchange in Europe late in the morning at 96.24 a.m. on Berlin.
5.8 percent down for the month of October, Thursday fell 39 cents.
Sufficient supplies of crude oil are at the price in recent weeks.
The energy department told Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week
Over five weeks, the supply has increased by over 25 million barrels.
But one suggestion of strong demand has been made by the expert that two reports on China's construction have come Friday.
This shows that Kiwikas can continue to strengthen China's economic recovery after a drop in 7.8 percent in the third trimester of the last trimester.
Brand Crud also dropped $208.58 from 26 cents per barrel to a Benchmark for international hot oil used by American refiners in London.
The court has blocked the operation of the New York Police Department on the break and the crida policy
On Thursday, a United Court of Appeal ordered a judge to suspend the New York Police Department and remove the judge from the case.
The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal Judge Shara Shindler said the judge's decisions would be delayed by an appeal by the city.
In the city of the judge, the people were informed of the violation of the Constitution in August of stopping and questioning.
The city's police department has also decided to assign a supervisor to help with its policy and related training program changes, its conclusion and its therapeutic order.
The court heard the arguments on Tuesday’s appeal.
The Court has said that since he disputed the need for a judge to avoid the presence of partiality in part of a series of media testimonies and that he should be removed from the case of the judge from different behavioural practices by the US judges, the public should be held accountable to the Court of Justice.
The judge made a decision, even though police officers wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people with their pauses and play shows, focusing on black and Spanish men.
He has set up an external monitor to monitor major changes in nurturing, training and surveillance with financial improvements, and he is most shut down where in some areas he has ordered a pilot program to test body cams in some areas.
In August, New York City agreed to complete the custom of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases had been interrupted by a police officer.
A verbal argument on the city's appeal is indicated for some time after March 14, 2014.
A break and play device has been discussed with citizens' rights.
The break and the cricket policy has been in some way around the decades, but most black and Spanish men, 684330 to 2011, under the administration of Free Mayor Michael Bloomberg, have been marked by a dramatic increase.
A trial of four men was conducted by all minors in 2004 and a class action became a case.
The support for change in NYPD's break and play program has said that inappropriate behaviour will end with another more reliable and effective police force impacting and may influence the use of police in other police departments.
Opponents say the changes will reduce police mobility, but crime, money and not corruption will solve a major problem of police force after the earthquake by thousands of officials over the last decade.
The judge has noted that the pause and play had not ended, which is logical, but had improved the implementation of NYPD's stop.
Many of the participants in the training included Goddess, Pacula, Jamshedpur, wealth, thousands of dollars, and the fourth of the year.
During seven days, all participants were informed of several schools, including Tint Pitching, Flag Pole.
Dr. Aushus Kumar Rhy and Jesus, with the cooperation of the profession of training.
All participants are sharing the feelings of unity, joining in prayer.
The mayor of the camp, Vipin Kumar, is giving his special cooperation with the training of the state.
Collins used phone hacking to confirm secret information
The former editor of the News of the World has been accused of using "phone hacking, surveillance and Amman-samana" in an attempt to confirm their habitual relations while keeping Charles Clark's house safe.
The organizer Andrew Addis C told Old Bally that News of the World heard a misdemeanour in May 2005 that Clark was meeting with his "tractive Special Adviser" Hannah Polby.
The court said that the newspaper appointed private investigator Glen Malcolm to hack the Polish Voyssmal and "keep watch", but Colson also called and left his Voyssmal.
Mr. Addis  , "The suggestion of the accession party is that Mr. Colson, who is currently the editor of the N.O.T.Blu, is not known to stand outside the people's home to watch them, but they have articles in front of people, to see how people react to it."
They said that N.O.T.D.Blu used three ways to check cases: phone hacking, surveillance and Amman-Samana.
In the third generation, the editors themselves were.
Obviously, he knew other ways, namely surveillance, he certainly knew.
What about the first?
Did he know about phone hacking?
They say, no, we say, "Yes, they did."
Afavou about clarak's relationship with the U.T.D.Blu's Facebook desk was presented for the first time when a source that was popular in Sushi Polby said: "Don't waste your time, he's with Charles."
In August 2006, at least three times the tape of Voyssmal was taken from the home from Malkier, the phone of Sushi Polby.
Researchers also found entries in the personal investigator's computer, which included the name "Project" for Sushi Polby and their sister.
During the time that they were being tested, a missing name was called about them by Sushi Polby's grandfather.
During this time, the former chief reporter Nevili Steurlbach and former reporter James Wenderup saw the monitoring of the arrival of Sussar Polby.
On June 18, 2005, Colson told them through a Voysmel: "I've got a story that we're planning to do tomorrow, which I'm sure I'll talk to Charles about."
Mr. Addis said that colson's involvement in this matter is only in the other important parties, such as the former house, namely the famous David Blancett.
The judge told the teacher that Colson had talked to Mi. Blancett about the relationship with a married woman, while he was seeing the case of co-terrorist Rebecca Brooks who were married at the time.
Colson and Brooks refused to contact others to make phone calls between October 3 200 and August 9, 2006.
Malcolm, Sturlbach and Weatherup have accepted phone hacking.

Under the direction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German Home Agency, the mission was to take a picture of the cover of the United States, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundisbank.
The German media told BfV to hope to identify the presence of Licensing Anthony and signaled an exchange between the German Foreign Ministry in the United States and Berlin.
James Claper, director of the U.S. National Café, stressed that America was able to steal the secrets of its foreign Café's trading capabilities and to increase international competition or to increase their line below." Then don't use them in September.
But since Edward Snowden, a poet who has become a Wesblover, began to tell the U.S. supervisors of his secrets, the leaders of the European government and the business world are no longer certain that the director is not going to keep his word.
According to the U.S. National Security Agency, Brazil’s oil company Petrobras was raided and our clown suppliers Google and Yahu and Yahu feared the government’s official oversight.
The last thing happened when it was discovered that Chancellor Angela Marcel was bugged, probably a decade ago.
If Europe's most powerful people can be noticed, trade world leaders are definitely also targeting potential targets.
Snodon has made extensive cooperation between US Secret Services and companies transparent.
I think it would be a procedure to use these data for mutual benefit.
Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, says that "German must be awake," representing small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published in July by the German companies, the United States has now become almost a major target, such as China, when it comes to industrial fraud and data theft.
In all the documents by Mr. Snowden, there is, however, no evidence to date that America went to the mystery of foreign business for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern about the lack of Internet capabilities of the European Union, and it should try to reduce its dependence on America.
Trade world leaders are doubting this.
Someone in German parliament said we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
Haso Plattner, president of the German Business Software Company SAP, said, "This is no way,"
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, he would not have died 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany comes from coal, cars, and kerosene.
But the IT industry is everything.
The United States of America has proved to be an attack on some companies openly exposed to US technical improvements and jazz arrivals, which are at the greatest risk of being considered to be the most vigilant.
A major change is taking place in the Cloud computing area, where the European authorities are more vigilant that data stored in the United States is subject to that jurisdiction and are therefore likely to become sensitive.
According to a survey conducted by a trade agency, some 10 non-EU members cancelled their plan to use a US-based cloud provider after opening a Data Prime Crime Program.
Jim Snabe, chief executives with SAP, say, "We saw a new question that did not come to customers a year ago -- that is - my data is stored?
Many German authorities argue that the latest reports are just confirming whether they already knew: the powerful government wants to steal their most secure secrets and data, and that should be watched at all costs.
It's not a wonder that economics is a joke.
It's always happened.
"This is a subject for many years, and through the original current discussion, nothing has changed," says Kurt Bock, the chief executive of the chemical manufacturer BASF.
We are being hunted at the commercial and industrial level, and so do we, because it's in national favour to protect our business.
Corporate leaders are generally reluctant to protect the system and are a benefit to the attacker.
For large companies, the message has been being recorded for a long time, although it is not clear whether to leave a shop in the house by taking usb stick, or to leave a laptop bepanah in a hotel room, it is not clear to say at least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of the car manufacturer's audio, says that this is a year old system to collect mobile phones before board meetings because their use could not be as remote audio devices
Germany's BfV operatives, while smart phones are coercing about gambling abroad, advises to consider using a simple pre-paid mobile.
Prepaid mobile phone was dropped later.
Although small and medium-sized companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring it is a matter of concern.
In Germany, it's a number of companies in the global market in a special place.
"Small and medium-sized companies often have a lack of experience, workers and financial resources to effectively protect the secret of the corporation," BfV warns in a report.
The United States has warned of the economic downturn of its own companies through other countries.
According to France The Washington Post, the name of the U.S. National Chufia in February with Russia and Israel, which is named after China's financial disclosure, is in another tank of related crimes in hacking.
According to a German blue chip company board member when it comes to making money, "French is the worst
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the Internal Secret Agency DCRI, says in the testimony: "Services know that all countries are well united in a non-extreme war, and are emboldening their partners."
We are being hunted at the commercial and industrial level, and so do we, because it's in national favour to protect our business.
No one makes a fool.
The parents of Georgia's child killed in a "great accident" believe that their son was killed
A young man in Georgia whose dead body was found trapped in his high school gym in the restaurant mat, believed that their son had been killed, the family leader said to Thursday.
Valdosta, J.A., Kendrick Johnson was arrested on January 11 in front of his high school gym in Blichers.
London County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson was dead in a 'unique accident' but the family of 17-year-old boys refused to do so.
Benjamin Rape, representing Kenneth and Jaklin Johnson, said to Fox News Dot Com: "They must fully believe that their son has been killed."
They don't trust death in the way that Sheriff told them.
Rape said, "They believe that this is a matter of physical law and common sense."
They believe that this conclusion is a guarantee for the death of their son or for the protection of the people.
They said, “He sent his son with a book, and he went back to his bag.”
U.S. Prime Minister Michael Mulder told Thursday that he was investigating an official on Johnson's death, seeing that many important questions were answered.
What was the cause of death?
Did his murder result from a crime?
Mora said these words to Thursday at a newspaper conference.
I'll follow the facts, they'll take us anywhere.
My purpose is to bring forth the truth.
They said: "I think that there is an environment in which to test."
Mure told the reporter that the initial blood test indicates that Johnson's death resulted from "static sensitising".
According to Mure, a second corpse was found to be a different cause of death."
They said: "There are many questions which must be answered or which must be confirmed."
Mure also said that if he finds sufficient witnesses to challenge or investigate civil rights in Johnson's death case, he will ask the FBI to do so.
On Thursday, no representatives from the London County Sheriff's office were available immediately for comments.
On Wednesday, South Georgia's judge ordered the authorities, the investigators, to release all surveillance videos.
The boy's parents say they're hoping that some of the video footage will show how his death occurred.
C.C. issued children's URI index for schools
On Wednesday, disease control and prevention center issued guidelines to control children's food allergy at school.
The U.S. government has issued such guidance for the first time, as the number of children who go to school is increasing.
Now one child in 20 in the U.S. has food allergy.
C.D.C. found that between 1997 and 2007, children had increased 18 percent in food allergy cases.
This guidance informs students how teachers and workers should be informed about the food allergy of children, and how to handle it in the event of an allergic reaction.
Students have also been advised to keep the stocks of epinephrine to cope with potentially fatal enphylaxis, which is the auto-injector of the Epinen Brand, which is most commonly used.
The state parliament has recently updated the rules, making it easier for schools to keep the stocks of Epiphany in stock as much as possible.
This report also contains a list of common symptoms reported by children with an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "Something seems to be happening in my tongue," "It seems to be that my tongue has hair," or, "It's happening in my tongue."
Parents of intersex kids can choose their children's 'undefined' line
Germany has become the first European Union country that has approved the third sex for children born with indistinct genes.
The new children will no longer be repeatedly specified by men or women.
According to the new law, parents do not need to announce sex for such children, this law allows them to declare sex "unspecified" or "unspecified" on the child's birth certificate.
The purpose of the new law is to reduce the pressure on parents who can make decisions regarding sex-specificity for newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex children.
According to B.B.C., an intersex person said years later, "I'm neither a man nor a woman."
I'm going to be a pain in the ass made by doctors.
According to estimates, there is a child in every two thousand every year who is neither male nor female.
They're intersex, part of a group of nearly 60 situations, which comes within the testing of sexual development disorders, this is a common word that is used for unusual characteristics, genetics (individuals or growth), or unusually developed sex.
Maybe Vallis Simpson is still intersex.
Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in United States believe that when sex cannot be determined, the best use of the best information available to specify sex is to be used and to check the psychological and physical development of the child before such a change occurs.
New York City psychologist Dr. Jack Dresser, who is a specialist in sex science, said the new German law "seems good."
Intersex children create moral inconsistencies.
They said: "There are some people who are in a state of great distress, and who are in need of health, but most of them are not with children."
You can only specify a string without a line-check, and then see how identification is developed.
The science of knowing how to develop a sex in a child is not very accurate.
No one can answer correctly why this is happening.
It's a kind of puzzle why people are homosexual.
In 2011, the report submitted to the European Commission describes intersex people as being different from those who are transsexual or transgender, because their situation is not related to sex, but is related to their life structure, which is neither clearly male nor female, but is either in a complex form or is not clearly defined by either.
These characteristics can show themselves a secondary sexual image, such as the weight of the muscles, the distribution of the hair, the breast and the length; primary sexual image such as reproductive limbs and genital mutilation; or qualitative design and hormones.
This report provides insight into the discrimination faced by Intersex and Transgender people in the labour field, as well as about oppression, violence and respect for crimes.
Now there are special camps for non-sex boys.
Australia and Nepal have already been allowed to mark older people on their official documents as men, women or "third sex".
In June, 52-year-old Australian Nori Me-Walby became the first certified "lingless" person in the world after winning the "unspecified" sex class.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, there will be a third specification for persons other than M or F in German passports as X.
According to the news report on France 24, the neighbouring country still has issues related to sex in France.
In 2011, French law-makers signed letters from this strictly Catholic country to go back to Jachika from the school's books.
The website of the U.S. Catholic Online has also opposed this German law, saying, "while the world is going to be in a situation where the sex itself is chosen, but not the youth activism, we are taking two and more columns in the opposite direction."
In Maryland, the mother of a newborn baby, also told Babe Jon that she would like to see the babysitters designated at birth.
He said on the website, "The upbringing is very stressful without limits, especially if you don't even know what your child's sex is."
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both males and females were called Hermaphrodites (Ubaillingi), a beautiful Greek goddess named twice.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered the sex to be a slat that could be deleted and rewritten.
But now many people are challenging the morality of breast-feeding, they understand that sex-pregnancy is complex, and sometimes even doctors may fail, who don't know how they will feel about their sex specification when they grow up.
Drescher says, "In the middle of the 20th century, it was called "Monorog" in the fall of the 20th century.
When these children were born, you didn't call the mentalist, you called the Shely-Chiticist.
The current principle on the treatment of indiscriminate genital mutilation was presented by Dr. John Mani of John Hupkins University, who considered sex to be acceptable.
They also argued how social and environmental signs raise the child - parents - interact with the child's genes and hormones to determine how to identify him as a man or a woman.
But in a 1966 case, which is known as "John/Joan", the principles became controversial.
They advised a child whose mother-in-law had been in an accident during the sex-extinguishment (Circamsession) that they should complete the child's custody and be like a red-and-white girl.
The Dresser said: "Manny presented the matter as a matter of success, but it did not happen."
At 15 years of age, the child turned back as a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Dresser said some doctors are still "watching the same image".
But in the years since 1990, with the arrival of the Internet, these sex-shaly-kirkitsa people began to face "not happy with the environment".
That was the case with 36-year-old author Jim Bruce of Montana, who was born with X.Vai.
The doctors did not clearly understand that his sex was small, or his brother-in-law was big, but they were sure that he could never live as a "satisfied life" as a man.
Therefore, shortly after his birth in 1976, the breast and breast-feeding were released from the womb of Bruce and his teenage daughter.
She was given a female hormone at 12 years of age.
He said to ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl."
I wasn't happy, but it was very difficult to question.
At 18 years of age, he was going to be Vizinoplasty with him.
But feeling uneasy and some confusion, he asked for medical records.
This made him aware of the terrible truth.
When I was born, I was bound -- and nobody ever told me.
Bruce was born with a D.S.D., which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone, causing his genes to fail to develop properly.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, he took a testosterone meal and removed his breast.
He's been hanged because of Shel-Cyktytsa.
Today, he explains to people about intersex people in the Interface Project organization to make their own ideas normal.
However, the California-based media group Advockets for Information Services, the president of Ani Tamer-Matis, is concerned that the German law "invites Chipie and Kalek."
They say, "Many activists think that the German law will move the mother-to-father to make a quick decision and the child to define "unspecified."
We are afraid that this will encourage action.
We think it's better to specify a man or a woman's sex than to wait.
But we don't know how law works, so we can only assume.
Tammer-Matis says their organization supports Australian law because "it allows the elderly to be identified in the third sex."
They said, "Let the elderly be able to decide for themselves what is right and what is wrong with them."
The law of Germany relates to specifying it at the time of its birth.
It's not a war fought by new children at this time.
When they grow up, they can make their own body-related decisions.
But Pittsburgh's breast radiologist Dr. Erlin Baratz, whose daughter has a side effect, and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that German law would "give both parents and children power."
Baratti's daughter was born with male characteristics, but she had a complete androgen insensitivity address known as D.S.D.
Since his androsion was a crime in the country, women's favorites developed in Katy.
His body is Jonah, but there's no pregnancy or depression.
Now 29-year-old Katy is married, and she is a resident of the Child Psychology Department at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she's pregnant, she expects to become a mother through oral or oral surgery.
Baratz said, "This is a law which enjoins parents not to make a decision upon themselves.
It provides them with a proper understanding and time by some tests before writing 'man' or 'woman'.
So, you're okay -- raise the child, love the child.
You have a love child and enjoy it.
We don't need to do any slicing in a hurry that can't be returned.
They said, "This will be a decision that will bring children to life and free them from harm to their parents, because they do not believe that they are doing right."
Finally, the child will determine which sex he is easier with -- and it will be a very good thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.
A legal wake-up camp was organized in the Central College of Ramangar, in the chairmanship of all judges of the Shahil Legal Szisez Committee, Cheerman and Ramangar.
In which students and others were informed about the law for the right of education and the economic welfare of the backward people.
In the camp, Edvocket Emil Kupta, Rohin India, and Sarpuch woke up the people talking about the subject.
A large number of villagers were present in the program.
Report: Think of the Biden dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to New York Times, president Barack Obama’s closest advisors secretly considered Hillary Clinton’s position as deputy president, Kelly Beden, for 2012.
The most remarkable threat is that Mark Halperin and John Helman, expected by 2012 campaign Tom, "Double Down: Change Game 2012."
Times received a copy of the following book, and Thursday night told the president's top advisors what would help Obama to find out in the fall of the election hope that he would be able to help dump bidins to organize "wide-group sessions and late 2011".
According to National Political Secretary Jonathan Martin, the book explains the full extent of the efforts made by the Chief Officers and the billing of the head of the White House staff for the name of the former White House staff to know what the change from the vice president of the former state has to do with the pole.
The likely switch was a very secure secret between the basic roofs of the Chicago campaign and the Oval Office.
Only half of the president's closest advisors – including former Obama campaign leader Jim Massina, and former White House top consultants David Axlerod and David Paluffe – were aware of the changes.
"Dublin" claims that the trap tried to change Biden despite their personal agreement before finally making a decision as to when their information was being disclosed would not improve the situation in Obama's client's ticket.
In a witness with Martin, Date has confirmed that the administration had actually considered the location of Clinton with Biden.
"He told me to keep an eye on the whole video, and one of them put it on," he said to the newspaper.
Do you remember that the president was in danger at that time, and we were in a state like this, "Holy Christ, what more shall we do?"
While the drop told the research as "warning", Martin told the CNN's Anderson Cooper again the election campaign took an important step towards finding how much this claim would cost Paul.
"Mission like money don't spend attention on focus groups until they're seriously thinking about something," Martin said at AC360.
It's unclear, recent, whether Obama knew their team was looking for a change.
Martin told CNN that he asked if their boss knew about the possible change?
While he said they didn't think the president knew about the possible changes," former Chief of Staff admitted it was "possible" that Obama knew.
"Dubble Down" is certain: won't answer whether the politician checked and came to Obama's desk? Martin further said.
Cooper asked Martin if he didn't know about Obama's serious dumping ticket inquiry.
"Probably," said Martin.
Is Glo-in-Dark Ice Cream Preferred?
A British author has used the world's first Glo-in-D-D-Dark Ice Cream-Jelifish.
Charlie Francis has made the most of the marine animals to develop a better destruction.
He came up with this idea after reading a search letter on Jalyfish, and China's convinced scientists made use of chemical light to relight the protein.
This cream, which the eaters will react to in the language, will increase the PH level of the protein and the icescreen will shine.
Chris says icecream is brighter with a warm response to the mouth, which means more hits, it'll be so brighter.
Lic M.M. Dellicius Izcream Company's founder, Charlie, said: "This is incredible, but the production of the early days will get me about 2 grams of stuff from £200."
The protein we're using in icescreen will react with a neutral pash in the language.
As hot as the face is, the protein pash will increase and the ice cream will shine.
We've been experimenting for the past few months and it's looking perfectly right to share it with Halloween because it's a wonderful light.
It's probably the most important ice cream that's made by me because the light of the celery is four times as high as gold.
The cost of each shoe comes to me about 140 pounds.
Although taste is very good.
The commercial company, based in Bristol of Charlie, is famous for its apne flavor, with beer, cheese, meat and gold card.
But its next design is more important to prove.
They said, "Indeed, I wanted to develop an invisible crime."
It's a natural impossibility because of ice crystals that make the inversion over ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
This cream is used as a mirror of a gelifish, which has been studied by Chinese scientists
The king's garden market was full of customers.
The last thing was that people had to wait 15 to 20 minutes to buy cargo.
This was the news of the Hungarians, the Indians, the Indians, the Nanarpurs, the Ashok Museum of Central Markets, and the Pacific City of Central Markets.
Some of these were also found at the Serrafa shops in Model Town, Pimpura, Ashok City.
These also bought for the money, and for the treasures of gold, and of silver, and of silver, of silver, of gold.
That's why I'm stuck in other markets with an external ring wheel.
Although it took hours to get home from the office.

The dream of the stockbrokers to trade in the market in transport Aria has not been realized.
The cops are trapped in fun after Heicourt's orders.
Neither can they now trade in the temporary stock market created in Reggat Avenue, nor have they been issued a license to trade in Transport Ireland.
The Commission, composed by Penjab and Haryanana Heicourt, announced the temporary flagship market during its tour.
And there he laid the guilt of ten thousand pieces of silver to the officer of the guard, because there was no proper provision.
Heicourt, in his order, has called into question the administrative authorities of the Mortar, saying that a task that has not been able to solve a problem for nine years was not solved.
They could not be found in the correct location in the city.
The shipowners were then asked to issue a licence for trade in the shipping market.
After the order, the shopkeepers were happy, but the police returned the water on Friday.
The real license of the police came to the market and sold the farm on the counter.
It was impossible to meet the conditions that were given to them in one day.

In one mine, a firefight was called to save a lost pup at the top of a catastrophic mountain
Cooker Spaniel Ruby was parted after arriving in a small street corner
He was seen three days later by a dog Walker in the trench.
Fireworkers sent down a part of the stone to protect the dog from death
After being captured by the pope from somewhere on the ground on 50 feet above a catastrophic mountain, he was given a life of favor by being called fire workers.
For nine months, the cook's Spanish Ruby had fled to a street on Sunday afternoon, and three days before being rescued from the desert.
Their master Scott Elderson, 25, and their girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, Denhom, were in the flepite desert in the western Yorkshire, and they have blessed the West Yorkshire fire and the rescue service.
After a small accident, they had been searching for their lost dog like madmen, and had been posted on social networking sites.
On Wednesday afternoon at 2.15 p.m., a fast - looking Dock Walker saw Ruby, at the height of 50 feet from the ground on the hill.
A technical rescue team from the Calcutta Fire Station came to the scene and came down by Russia to save Ruby and used a pet tube to bring him down from the rock.
Technical Defence Officer Andy Clayton said: 'It was in a dire situation.
It was in the middle of the front of the rock, above and below 50 feet.
He did no mighty work in the days of his deliverance: he was made a stone.
But now he's good.
After that, she was eating biscuits.
It was an unusual aid call.
In fact, it's unbelievable to see a dog.
Special Defence Officer Peter Loe said: "Ruby has survived in a positive way."
It was possible to be seriously injured or worsened.
Ruby was taken to an animal doctor to test, where she was found to be better than fatigue and disillusionment.
From Halifax, West Yorkshire, Miss Hall said, "It was horrible to see the work"
At first I couldn't believe how she got there.
It's amazing to get him back in your hands.
The animal doctor said that if she were too tired and falling, she would certainly fall down.
The fire department did a lot of good work.
What they did is really very brave.
We are grateful to them, and they were all better.
Mr. Elderson also said, "We were afraid she might fall, but she was there."
The fire department did a great job.
I can't believe how she got there.
Mike Jagger says that when Katy was 18 years old, they didn't attack her.
This week, during a witness with Australian radio show, Pon Star said he was singing back vocals for the 2004 song "Old Habits Day Hard".
Perry said he had dinered with the top rocker, and "When I was 18, they beat me."
They said, “This is an old age, and they have treated me kindly.”
The 70-year-old Jagger's representative said to Thursday in a statement that he "never clearly refuses to attack Katie Pari."
The representative also said, "Perhaps Pari is talking about them in the misunderstanding of another person."
Parry was one of the guests coming as a guest on Rolling Stone's tour this year.
Their new album "Prizem" reached the top of the week.

The port controls on Bervik and the walls of Hadrian indicate stories about the boundary of the contilla star.
It is true that the Strathclid Paper described the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, although it has not been described in - expected - headslines.
Neither did anyone describe that U.S. members spend most of their time changing their administrative rules according to their needs.
Since Scotland is no longer a ski area, so Brussels will actually be free to get whatever it takes from Scotland instead of constantly non-filling Brussels.
So, then, A-Kahani.
And the thing that's been stuck for so long has come together. First, I heard the "freedom means passport control" of Bananad, almost 40 years ago.
Yet this wonder of the old tale is lost.
Why should we expect to build Europe from Scotland as well?
Why should London's Jok be sold for Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: Europe's great, war-after-war plan has finally stopped.
With the Euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
The dedicated groups are being strengthened to oppose or close the U.S. in the entire e.U.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptil Alternetive Form German Party -- which has been set up this year -- suddenly received about five million votes in the September election, and thus effectively expelled Free Democrats (the equivalent of our free demos) from the Bundestag.
The EU's plans to build Europe are always in conflict.
However, the current economic crisis has proved to be a fundamental variable.
In addition to the harsh rules imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, many people are thinking that the European project has gone a long way because of the obstacles imposed on national economies.
There was not much role to Euro's disaster in the excessive budget loss of national governments - that was true only in the case of Greece.
In fact, the Euro system has established the exchange rate for its members in favour of German exporters - things that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of underestimation of domestic currency, South Europe finds itself in an inherently damaging situation of production compared to Germany.
The only way is to reduce the scale and public policy - encouraged by Berlin.
Current budgets and money problems are facing a serious European producer.
In order to free French and German energy companies under user law - as a result of the "silver" energy losses imposed by Brussels, European industry pays four times for electricity and gas compared to the United Nations.
It's a payback damage, which we've already seen in Grandmouth.
Even if all payments are frozen in the world, the European Petrochemicals industry cannot avoid being influenced by S.S. Shell Gas.
As a result, the feeling of rebellion in the people, especially in France, has been praising the U.S. chief.
After the war, the top politicians of France saw the E.U. as a tool to control Germany, and Paris as a tool for providing equal payouts in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy, and it has applied its own financial policies to Europe, which is why France's economy is dwindling.
Result: Marin Le Pen's Southern Party, U.S. Anti-National Front has won a third-place ruling socialist in the recent subordination.
At this time, France has the most popular group with 24 percent vote -- this is a timely warning for the British lab that they cannot believe that the left-hand operation will be of benefit to the right.
What is Le Pene French cows doing with their new reputation among the working class?
The group wants to use the e.g. options that will be used next year in the European Parliament to create the antiquities, the most expensive currency.
If, as far as possible, these options allow, the opposite groups to display good e.g. their appearance, then the same group can first influence the European context.
My view is that soon, in Europe, the E.U. and the most precious currency will put an end to the anti-fraud feeling of Euro.
Euro won't be completely over, but it will come back in a way that will be supported by General De Goll, like "Europe of Nations (the Lord's)".
Germany and some of its implications may keep Euros, but France and South Europe will restart their currency.
I expect the U.S. to keep itself away from this project, hoping to increase its proximity to the U.S.
However, the increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland’s last?
We can choose to continue to build the Little England area (usually).
Or we can protect our own financial interests -- which includes telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better in the long European law, provided we keep our own money.
It will be easy to work together with other similar countries in Europe of non-governmental nations.
Otherwise, we should consider keeping our financial freedom on the path to Norway.
In Scotland, the S.N.P. government - remarkablely - is the most successful media-opposing political campaign in Europe, which won an amazing majority in 2011 on the basis of the Tori-Lib Dem Group.
It would be pointless to vote for freedom at this time for Scotland, because in that situation it will be subject to the rules of the constitution imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Young People Ask — How Can I Get Involved?
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls get younger than their teenage girls.
Physical changes do not mean that youth is near
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals can be blamed.
Experts believe that obesity can be a cause of youth in a low age.
Young people in pre - Christian times may not be so effective
In the early years of C.N.N., communication experts are experts in child health and family issues.
Should the mother be concerned if the development of breast development and the birth of the genitalia begin in her daughter at age 7 or 8?
This week, in Orlando, Florida, U.S. Children's Medical Academy, Child Doctors Andocrynologist Dr. Paul Caplovitz explained that this initial physical change is common in American girls, they show new behaviour.
Caplovitz says, "I spend a lot of time trusting the investors - that it usually doesn't show rapid progress in the direction of full youth."
The apparent signs of development, such as the enigma of the stems, the genitals and the ribs, and the body's mucous membranes, appear before time.
But in the last four decades, there has been a significant change in the age of Revelation (first month).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in 1970.
"When the breast begins to develop, the first generation seems to be at least two or three years old," says Caplovitz, who are also the authors of the "time-to-time youth in girls: the guidance needed to deal with this common problem."
The most accurate test of youth development is time.
Young people argue about what is beginning, but when they grow up with breast development before they're eight years old, they call it "baby-growth."
In most cases this process will be slowed down or stopped - the child can be monitored by doctors.
In the event of more rapid progress, the endochronologist may need to be checked to remove the possibility of serious problems such as tumors or systems.
Time-before month-laws and other outcomes are treatments to delay: time-earning age of seconds, which can result in regular growth and age.
Constitutions for drugs or hormones depend on child's age, development rate, growth rate, and emotional age.
Psychological aspects are also important.
There are reports of caplovitz drugs, but they admit, "Youth can increase pressure on business issues, and girls can feel different from their peers."
Another major problem can be understood: the parents don't just want their youngest daughter to have a month and a half.
Caplovitz said, "They're worried about the pregnancy, or how they'll keep it clean."
A woman whose daughter had started monthly religion at the age of 10 remembers, "It was a shock."
Although there were signs of this and we were talking about mass religion, it wasn't emotionally prepared.
She was afraid of her school and returned troubled that she had started the first monthly religion in her companions.
There are many popular principles about the causes of somatic youth.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones, chemicals, or media may be charged with minor messages in milk or other foods.
Boys - like girls - are getting younger in the past.
Caplovitz states that the main reason for this is the anger of neutrality.
She helped to conduct a study on girls from 6 to 9 years of age in 2001, which adds body weight to youth.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors contributing to it.
In this country, African-American and Spanish girls tend to get young before their teenage daughters.
There are many explanations of this.
On a global level, the representation of time-before youth, from economic situations to weather and genes, seems affected by all things.
Other puzzles: Although boys are getting their faces and genital mutilation at a low age, the behavior of young girls is completely unclear.
Other physicians attending the A.P. assembly supported the complexity of the subject.
Even to the children and to the children is the sight of the womb and of the offspring.
In Morristown, New Jersey, the Balearic Anthologist, Dr. Lawrence Silverman, says, "We need to be careful about how we recognize the real beginning of youth."
The parents should not be ashamed to take the lead from their child doctor in order to think about it.
Caplovitz advised, "This may mean talking before the expected time."
If you stay calm, your child will usually answer correctly.
Pre-development girls need to be assured that even though this is going ahead of time, it's part of normal life.
The temperature dropped 3.1 degrees Celsius on Tuesday.
And it came to pass on the morrow, that the rain and the cold fell upon the people.
And it came to pass on the morrow, that they went out into the markets and country to their own possession.
The first rain of the cold has also been brought to light.
And in the morning, when the people saw the smoke, they rejoiced.
When the weather changes, the heat and the disease will provide a lot of relief, but then the smoke will continue to cover the cloud all day long.
The children also came to school wearing sweaters.
There, according to the Airfors Weather Department, the maximum temperature of 25.1 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature of 13.7 degrees Celsius remained on Tuesday.
While 7.8 millimetres of rain has been measured.
The clouds will remain above the sky, according to the weather section.
For the width of the seat, there is a dispute on the large orders of the jet manufacturers.
There has been a conflict establishing a dispute law for sub-months between air carriers for long distance flights to the width of the passenger-class seats
On long flight, the argument focuses on the width of the Economie class’s seat, as always, not as given by Airlines, but whose designated position has claimed to be the key to the latest jet Airbus SAS and Boing company.
Erbes has this week set at least 18 inches (46 cm) in an economic cabin, but it should be determined by the Airlines by its main-priority Boing.
The argument maker comes between when a large version of the engine that is connected to the long-range Arcraft was sold after the event of 17-21.
How's the last section of the plane built - especially if the seat is 9 or 10 equal to the more capacity dimensions are being designed to take into account the design of the mini-jambo jets?
Boing says it's "777 X" that will keep 406 people 17 in a row and 10 people in a single section.
Airbus says that fighting A350 will take 350 people to the 18th in the left-over 9th in the seat.
Air DGG often trades on technical matters through advertising in the commercial press.
Now, there is hope for more than 100 warrants in Dubai with Airbus 777 X, which is going to appeal to the public.
Recently it's seen that there's nothing going on at the beginning of the war, and will you accept this by showing this to Finnsero together in a restaurant?
Airbus Business Chief John Lehei said that "Booing is also offering long-distance flights to complexes from Boing Regional Terbo".
As a change, people are getting better, but there's no change in the way they sit.
According to data from the U.S. Department of Health, in the 1970 ’ s, Boing 747 gembo ne modern - day travel was defined as tha, and the average age of 40 - 49 - year - old U.S. nose ke weight increased by 10 percent.
According to U.S. Health Statistics, the average man in the 21st century is 39.7 in the United States.
Airbus says it's rivaled by a 1950 sit-in when the new name was the average work of the "jet set",
Airbus says they have set up a research commission to suggest improvements to the quality of sleep in an additional 53-festide seat.
Boing argued on the figures of the Airbus seat scale, saying that it does not depend on the decision of the manufacturers how to rent airlines and balance the facilities.
It's also said that the research is based on the experience of more cabins than the width of a seat.
Boing Kabin expert Kent Craver said, "It actually tells the airline how to provide the liner and the things they believe they need to do to be successful."
"They don't want to tell us who they benefit."
They know their business better than anyone else.
It's about the kitchen room for Flyers, but it's a quick point for the customers that this can affect the ice.
At least 700 billion dollars of trade behind this dispute is estimated to be sufficient for the US and European export levels to be reported in the coming decades.
The writer's report was first reported on July, which is what the battle is between the new jet planes in fact.
Airbus and Boing claimed 20 per cent of their new related engine design was the leader of the section, 365-Cit Boing 777-300.
Boing claims to depend on the 10th of a 777 - x - van base of 9th of a 777th of a design.
The unit profit is now used to compare 10 to the profit.
Kevin Kenston, Europe's Airbus Traveller's head says, "It's Boing's flying to create more competition with our products, and more seats."
On the other hand, analysts say that the entire 10-seat cabin for the current 777 S suggests that many passengers are on the side of the denser layout, which can also be rented with rest.
The cabin interior expert, my basket, the organizer and editor's Runwe Girl Network, said, "It's going to be a lot better for 18 Inchi's seat width travels, but the reality is that the Airbus's trading point is powered by the threat of 777"
Airbus and Boing do not provide seats, but provide a list of providers to choose for Airlines.
The world's jet salesman also carefully advises us to check out this layout competition.
As a result, all the buildings are also providing high-density readings for low-cost flight services and regional travel.
Airbus is giving a 10 equal A350 but they say it's not sold yet.
But recently, Airbus stressed some of its jet planes on large cabin seats to require more cabin facilities.
It is not possible to fly to a new industry standard without the support of other manufacturers of modern jet planes, but it can be derailed by 777 X sales.
New anti-Nicotine vaccines can end the joy of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-Nicotine vaccine that can end the fun of smoking.
The same poison of the vaccine, the rats were able to protect themselves from nicotin's latrine for life.
Prior to the initiation of human trials, and the need for trials, which may take several years, but in New York, Professor Ronald Crystal of Will Cornell Medical College said the physical signs are positive.
Professor Cornell said, "We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine policy can ultimately help millions of smokers who have tried to quit smoking using all the current methods in the market today, but they found that nicotine is much more powerful than these current methods."
There's a lost virus in the new vaccine that's prepared to get native information for the purpose of creating anti-nicotin antibiotics.
This virus, selectively inhibits the built-in cell, which then begins to form a permanent stream of antibiotics.
Antibodies are looking for any nicotine in the blood, and prevents nicotine from rising from within the smoker before reaching the brain.
In the test, the vaccine was given to those who were later given nicotine, and they continued their normal activity.
The researchers say that but the non-vaccinated kiss was "well", which was a sign that Nicotine had reached his brain.
This use was described in the journal Science Translucency Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines had failed because they had antibiotics.
It had to feed on the regular interval to maintain the level of the antibiotic, but it proved to be important and uninhabitable.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be high, because it will make the built-in cell an antibiotic factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the human vaccine of the future remained completely safe, it could be given to children before the craving for smoking, which could save them from nicotine.
But it will probably be used by smokers to quit smoking.
They said, "They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not find any pleasure in smoking because of nicotine's vaccine, which can help to save their habit.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but warned of the need for more research.
Even after Postmartm, the real cause of Baghin's death could not be hidden.
The forest department is naturally describing the death of the first visible garden in response to this.
On Thursday night, the forest of Ramangar Forest in the plains of the valley of Regerv, near the river Regerv, was struck by a garden.
There was no sign of any harm or injury on him, except all the parts of the garden were secure.
On Friday, the Sakt Bodola, the vice-president of the CTR, DFO Dhaksha Nimim, the SDO GS Carki, was postulated by the Hema Rattar of the Baghin animal in the presence of CTR medically loaded and the Kotabag animal.
According to sources, the interior noise of the garden is reported to be bad during postmartem.
This did not reveal the causes of the real death of the garden.
The district officials were responding to the death of the Bahin.
However, the interior parts of the garden have been sent to IVIRI Brazil to confirm the sea.
The Wand protector's western councilman Panda explained that the death of the garden can be said to be natural.
There's no sign of the garden.
However, it is also sending Bisra tests to confirm the ship, as well as to search the surrounding area.
Tripodi Obied rejects us from being influenced by us.
The former NSW Labour Minister will be checked by State Carpson Watchdog on JA Tripod.
Former NSW Labour Minister JA Tripod's maritime records that the conflict of policy has refused to appeal to his political master A.D.O.O.D., former New South Wales defender A.O.D., whose government-controlled role was hidden in three roles.
On Friday, the IACC checked that, what, Mr. Obid has violated several government ministers for violations of the protocol of the Patriarchate Policy? Where are the two restaurants and coffee owned by Obid, after the end of its reign in August 2005 without the tender.
Lin Ashpole, after the testimony given by the former Chief of Staff on Thursday, knew the secret self of Mr. Tripodi of the charge, Mr. Obid?
During the 2005 discussions, the government had pressured public tenders to be launched for flags.
The prisoners were against it, and they wanted more time.
In 2009, Obied’s company for boards, which earned $2.5 million a year, was renovated without board tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as door ministers from February 2006 to November 2009, were initially on the side of the public tender.
But they refused to change at Mr. Obid's request, Mr. Tripodi called for a change in government policy.
A photo of Mr. Obid and Mr. Tripod and Mr. Steve Dun in ICA on a phone call in August and September 2007, a senior official who came to the task of Mr. Obed after the construction of the port ministry
Assistant Anthony Wheely asked Mr. Tripodi. "Was the development of a policy on the matter being discussed on the telephone?"
"No," replied Mr. Tripody.
I couldn't remember what I was discussing, but it was definitely not.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obid.
Sirio says that Israeli warplanes shouted in Syria.
The Israeli warplanes set the goal of the city of Latakia at the port of Syria on Thursday night, a senior administrative officer confirmed the fact that Fox News.
The authorities didn't tell us what the plan was, but there was at least one goal.
The report of the Associated Press reports that the target Russian missile was SA-125.
Israel has attacked missiles in Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign workers can pass a "validity" test on 457 Vja
The government is considering a "validity" test for foreign workers on 457 Vja, as it aims to expand a tough activity.
If adopted, this test will be carried out by means of a mandate of 457 family and friends who will be used in order to fulfil or expand their unique roles in Australia.
Today, a government discussion letter was issued, criticizing the government's vocabulary about foreign workers, M.P. Maxine Mackow today said it could offend the neighbouring countries of Australia.
Today, he told the American Indian Institute that "foreigners are arriving at the end of the race" and that "Australians have been forced to work before" at a time when the Unions have demanded a safe labour market."
Historically, it was the wish that white workers should be protected -- and I would not be surprised if some people in the area had seen the response of that historical witness.
The discussion letter shows the outline of 12 plans, previously considered by Minister Chris Bowen.
Minister Brendan O'Conner, who was in Sri Lanka that morning, where he met with officials about the people who were spreading, has implemented five changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the "Authentication" mandate is adopted, the test of the Vija applicant can be made that "the name is true in situations where the person named, the owner or the personal associate of the person designing the Vija is a person."
Employers may need to count the number of 457 third-party holders, because the first businessman who wanted to organize fewer workers had hundreds of people at work.
During this time, 35-year-old Sri Lankan refugee died of a heart attack after a refugee on Christmas Island.
And he was with him on the way, about nine years old, when he came into Australia: and on the morrow after the death of his father a certain old brother bound him, which was in his father's house.
The Australian authorities brought him to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The British government has announced a study for growth in the benefits of the HS2 rail project in Scotland.
Work by HS2 encourages high-speed services in the northern part of Scotland and England, which will soon begin with the first step in 2026.
Transport Minister Barones Kremer said the project would be "British One".
Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said they are very "encouraged" by working with the British government on the project.
New high-speed rail lines will be included between London and West Midlands in the first step.
When the second step is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Lids.
In June, the government revised the cost of building a high-speed link between London and Northern England to £327.7 billion and revised £42.6 billion.
The British government, which was talking to Scotland transport, instructed HS2 to consider the ability and the time of the train for northern England and Scotland and the possibilities for making better travel.
It includes three hours or less of possible travel from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Byrones Kremer: "Our goal for HS2 is a real national network that will bring the Yukon and its cities closer."
We're moving forward with HS2, because it's going to be a lot more profit.
Without it, we will face problems related to the ability of our rail network.
But it's also about the connectivity of 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be linked to HS2.
According to Scotish Crewlist: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed for "clear" back to Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "Scotland is likely to benefit heavily from high-speed rails, but this will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in the case of high-speed rails throughout Britain.
Therefore, we are encouraged to work in the British government's participation so that we can check options to bring high speed rails in Scotland, create benefits for all and complete the Glasgow-Edinburg line, which the Scottish government is already planning.
I am ready to review the investigation report with the British government ministers next year and to take decisions together on the follow-up.
Air Power Tools Laws will now be effective in Australia
In spite of the mild steps taken in device management in the United States, Australia's air travel and air travel must continue to close its tablets and smartphones when they fly.
The U.S. Air Force has left open the option to change U.S. air service companies' processes so that they can read, view video or play games on their device during important flight steps, depending on the "Vivian" mode.
Travelers can do so during many flights now, but many people do not like to be able to access their e-book when they fly and fly.
Australian air service companies are considering this decision, according to which the US air service companies will have much work to do to meet this need, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plan to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said that it is considering the announcement, but stressed that the ban on the use of power equipment is still effective in important flight steps in Australia.
"In the present case, CASA has no special arrangement to control the use of electricity in the aircraft," the journal said, "this is within the administrations, which ensures that air service companies are always fully equipped with the security system, and that passengers are required to follow the security instructions given by the members of the driver group."
Virgin, who is already talking to CASA about expanding the use of her in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but she said to move on to the direction of Winnipeg.
The speaker said, "We will welcome the review by CASA in the case of the use of power devices, because we really think it will give customers a better experience, because we now have (wireless in-air entertainment) in our aircraft.
Quantas said it will now comply with the current rules.
He said, "We can't use electric devices when we're flying and landing according to our current policy, and we don't have an immediate plan to change it."
FAA decisions apply to U.S. airline lines.
So, we're always interested in scientific developments that can benefit the travelers and we'll definitely consider the decisions of the FAA and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision, each U.S. air service company will be different and will depend on the age of their flight.
The air service companies will need to confirm that their aircraft can tolerate radio execution by mobile devices, as well as they will have to investigate their rules in providing brochures, training materials, car-on luggage programs and travel details.
FAA said, "After the airline's approval of their flight's tolerance, he will allow passengers to use light-weight electric devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones on all heights."
In low visibility cases, the operator will command the passengers to stop their devices when they land.
The group has also suggested that heavy equipment be placed safely below the seat or in the upper decks while filling and landing.
Ponbrokers’ money because of the hard feelings of the middle class in Singapore
In Singapore, Bendemir Shopping Center, Panshop, Janny Amirthalinga is taking a bribe to pay her daughter's school fees to pay for her gold coins, rings, and stamps.
She said, “My husband and I have recently purchased a house, so our money has been trapped.”
They say, although they earn 3,000 Singapore dollars (U.S. $2,400) as an Administr, and their husband also works, but the family's monthly income is not enough.
In fact, in parts of South-East Asia, the same demand -- where the domestic loan is growing -- was made the third panshop on Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
It is not the only way to keep a low profile -- 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Sussar Amirthaling -- but almost unsecured bank loon.
In Singapore, Ponbroker usually pays 17 per cent annually, which is slightly more than 15.4 per cent of the United Overcrowding Bank, which has a local loan in the same shopping center.
However, ponbrokers have no benefit from the need for a credit check or a maturity, and they can make loans faster than the bank.
Millions of people in this area are developing a pan-shop due to the increasing cost of living by families and households and consumers.
Up to five years after the global financial disaster, strong growth in developed economies, and because of simple moral policy, the low- and middle-aged families are developing panshops to meet their needs.
This week's rating agency, the Standards Ange Powers, has reported on the growing domestic benefits due to the Mortgage, which are being used to monitor the borrowing of Asian banks.
He said that in Asia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore, there is the highest share of household income.
Malaysia is at the highest with 80 percent GDP, while in 2008 it was 60 percent.
Economics in Thailand are concerned about the high levels of consumer lending, which has been light-headed this week.
On Thursday, the data have been reduced in constant export volumes and users demand.
The Malaysian Bank of C.I.M.B., economist Song Song Won, said, "The key point is that with increased prices, people coming into the lower class will try to increase their income in every way possible."
In the past two years, high values of gold have historically led people to lose their personal property because they are taking advantage of the opportunity to lose the value of their family's possessions.
In Singapore, 70 percent of the gold seized in the 200 per cent of the city's population is gold.
People say, "Sone's feeling is good, let's keep Grandpa's mother's gold chain down, and they'll take it back next month.
The largest panshop operator in Thailand, Ejimney, has seen 20 percent of customers using their outage in recent months.
There is such an increase in the decline business that in Bendimire, the director of the Outlet, and in Singapore, 15 others, not only in their neighbors, are planning to expand in Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also planning to expand outside Asia, the executive director of the Valumex says Yah Le Ching.
The company will use $66 million of Singapore's $60 per cent on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week's listing.
While some discount landers have been investigated due to high interest rates, Sushi Yah says that lowering other borrowers is not only a constant rate, but it does not increase clearly in borrowing.
They say, "The buyers trap things that they already have, and they don't increase the loss of personal property in the home loan.
The social acceptance of ponbroking is increasing for short-term and secure financial assistance.
It's not that ponbrokers only use a poor person financially.
The wealthy in Singapore also use the Villemax outlet, which they hold down gold bars or watches so that they can pay up to 60 percent of their purchase value.
We have customers of all classes of society.
Suri Yah says, "These include rich people who need to borrow for a short time for practical activities or investments, or small businesses who need to meet their retail needs."
Sometimes they need only very little time.
India's largest businessman Mukash Imbani is banning Wif Nitta Imbani on November 1, 2013 on his 50th birthday.
Wisdom is not in Mumbai, but in Mumbai.
They organized a huge party on this occasion.
Many big stars from Bolivia arrived to join this party. On the evening of October 31, several large stars were seen picking up the plane at Mumbai Airport.
These are the stars of Keshma Kupur, and the song of Bozrah, and the song of Vinod Kangna, and the song of their poets, and the anointing of Kupur, and the king of Maktim Kupur, and the king's chamberlains, and the name of Rahul Boss Adi.
It is obvious how big a name you can count when you join the party.
325 million dollars for Tagie’s health
The U.S. government has stressed that 325 million dollars in health care is also linked to a tough package that will ensure that the government could not destroy the government's debt.
United Health Minister Tanya Plibersec has announced that the National Assembly, the island's old population, the high rate of genetic diseases, and the system's boundaries are "quick action" to address the current crisis.
The decision to provide financial support for four years was followed by government counseling with Andru Wilki, the independent army of Tasmania.
Ms. Plibersec said today, "The government has brought an emergency relief package, which we believe will meet the specific challenges facing the government.
The 325 million-dollar package includes the 31 million-dollar alternative surgery plan.
With orthopaedic and magnetic surgery, 2,600 additional operations, will help to address the latest collected cases.
This includes better care, training of medical experts, mental health services, and personal electronic health records to be launched in Hobart and Lansession.
Ms. Plibersek said, "These interventions are in line with the best ways I've been told to improve the health system in Tasmania by the petitioners."
The minister insisted that the government of Tasmania will face severe reporting and responsible government.
The government must maintain the current level of financial supply to obtain national funds, and report monthly where additional duties are being carried out.
Three members will be organized to ensure that the service is provided in an equally effective and efficient manner by the government.
Mr. Wilke said that 325 million dollars would not be much more, "until real improvements are made to the public health system of Tasmania at more reasonable levels."
Yet, they praised the government for responding to their urgent request for help, which they brought before the prime minister at the beginning of May."
Mr. Wilke said, "I hope that the Union's assistance package will be very helpful in separating the state's public health system from the crisis list."
According to the government, these additional alternative processes will mainly reverse recent generations.
But the U.S. Air Force believes that today's announcement is "band-ed resolution."
He said to the B.C.T.V., "We're here because the Lab State government has taken $430 million in its health system.
You can't believe that nearly half an billion dollars are taken by the government and that 300 million dollars are given by the National Assembly as a good news day.
Mr. Dutton asked that Ms. Plibersek should guarantee that no dollar will be spent on any of the rescue packages.

Observers said Syria has destroyed its ability to build its chemical weapons
The group monitoring Thursday said that Syria has destroyed important equipment for building chemical weapons and nuclear gas war materials, while a major conflict in northern Syria arose, which is very close to the location where the dedicated agents are considered to be held.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian Adolescent Group said that about three years ago, about 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the Syrian home war.
This announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before the end of November 1.
The Hege-based organization determined Damascus to destroy or "make unaffected" the machinery used to produce all chemical weapons and chemical gases and fill in war materials.
The main completion of the initial phase of the destruction is the stone of the resource mill in this major event, designed to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
Destroying the device means that Syria can no longer create a new chemical weapon.
Although Damascus still has to destroy the existing weapons and collections.
Syria is said to have now 1000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including Master Gas and Norwegian Agent Sirine.
The British situation in the Syrian observatory for Human Rights reported that this announcement occurred when Thursday grew up in the conflict in Sapphira, which experts believe is the chemical weapon production unit and also the storage centre.
On Thursday, a group describing the number of deaths from the Andolon network in Syria said that 120,296 people have died.
He said that of these 6,365 children are 61,067 ordinary citizens.
According to the government, 29.954 President Bashar is a member of the army of Asad, 18,678 fighters on the part of the government and 187 Lebanese Hizbollah aggressives.
He also said there are 2,202 troops in the dead and about 5,375 refugees, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the U.N. estimated that nearly 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
It hasn't updated the data since.
Because of this conflict, nearly 20 million people are forced to leave the country.
Assad's army was fighting rebels in Sapphira for weeks, many of which were related to al-Qaeda groups.
On Thursday, Obstetrics said people were killed on both sides, but clearly nothing said.
This war represents the threat faced by the arms inspectors, who have a very limited time-limit, a mission to end deadly weapons in Syria during the ongoing war at home.
In a statement to O.P.D.Blu, working with the United Nations, it was said that its group "is now satisfied and confirmed - and has seen all the important production and mixing/filling devices declared by Syria - destroyed."
He also said, "There is no monitoring plan anymore."
At the beginning of this week, observers said they had gone to 21 of the 23 centres announced by Damascus and completed the first step of the confirmation work.
The observers said they were unable to go to two centres for security reasons.
On Friday, O.P.D.Blu said those two centres, according to Syria, were "refused and... the chemical weapons products that were stored there were brought to other declared centres, which have been monitored."
It was not immediately apparent that the unit in Sapphira, one of the two centres where O.P.C.D. was not able to be monitored.
Syria has proposed a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved by the O.P.D.Blu's operational committee next month.
UHMAT UZUMKU, senior leader of the group, who has been monitoring the O.P.C.D.Blu, said, "I greet the strength and courage you have shown by people in carrying out the most challenging mission that this organization has ever done."
This house war has been going on for three years, mainly by the government of Asad and its security forces, including members of the Alaviet Church, and the rebellion is a conflict between Sunny Muslims.
In another event, Rami Abdurrahman, chief of the observatory, said that Wednesday had been severely exploded in Syria's coastal area of Latvia in the Air Defense Center.
He said that the cause of this explosion is not yet known.
The police have taken photos of the network records, the network stamps, the laptops and the web records.
Moti City Police has filed charges against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Demagitat Singh Gil reported that in the arrest warrants, the royal head of the city of Haboval, the city of Moon, included gold in Guggi, and gold in the temple.
The register office (former) has been run by a blizzard lion.
According to the police, Clarke and Recordwriter at the Registry were taking papers from the records of empty and old land and then buying new stamps and making online registers on them.
That's not what the real registry was going to do after.
After that, they sold the land for millions of pieces of money on the net.
There, they were taking lead on these papers.
After that, the real owner of the land was being harassed by police and administration.
The complainants of the network registry were especially interested in NRAIG lands.
Because there's no one in charge of NRAIG's land.
So it's easy to sell these land registers.
Police Commissioner Gill reported that the accused reported in the questionnaire that they have prepared a network of about 150 registered records so far.
According to the police, fraud and theft were the first insurrections against the political group.
A Cry for the Bomber’s Explosion
In 2002, the relatives and relatives of 202 people who were killed in the bomb attack in 2002 cried out to the bomb bomber's executioner's executioner, saying that amer fart should face the firing team.
Fate, who was running away as one of the most wanted in South-East Asia for nearly 10 years, was announced a 20-year sentence in the design of the explosive device used in the bomb explosion.
He can be released in 15 years if he is given the password.
A 45-year-old, who was attacked in two nightclubs in the famous Kuta resort, was convicted of mass murder, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of many other charges related to terrorism, including the serial bomb explosion in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The organizers had asked for the execution of Agenival Karavov, although they could also demand that this man, who was known as the master bomber, be put to death as a coward.
This decision renewed the painful memories of a woman who lives in Porta, June Cortini, who lost her 39-year-old daughter in the devastating attack by her allies a decade ago.
By stopping their hopes, they said that the execution of the executionist should have been carried out.
I really feel that he should have been punished just like other bombers.
Ms. Cortin said to the A.P., "He should be set up in front of the firing team."
I have to live without my family and my daughters every day.
On 12 October 2002, after 11 hours of night, the club was removed after the explosion of the bomb released outside The All Club.
Peter Hughes, a bagpack full of explosives by suicide attackers, was in the PD bar 20 seconds before the explosion.
As a result of this bomb explosion, they went to a long coma for a month and were "dead" three times while living on life-saving devices.
Mr. Hughes said that the executions should have been the same as those of the three other members of the group, who were responsible for this flood, Jammah Islamia, who had been killed four years ago.
In fact, this person must be executed before someone else dies.
There is no reason for him to keep alive.
After killing 202 people and punishing countless people, 20 years of punishment is not enough.
Packet, the last one to be punished by the Bali bomb blasters.
He was trying to avoid being arrested for nearly a decade, but eventually in January 2011, he was arrested in the Abtabad of Pakistan, where the U.S. Army had recently killed Chief Osama Bin Laden within four months.
During the trial, F.B.I. Agents submitted evidence that the report revealed that the South-East Asian terrorist groups and the recent attempt to re-establish contact with Bill Laden was in Pakistan to meet.
Sister Cortin says, "He didn't commit himself."
Even today, he is not really suffering from so much mental pain.
This decision came before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
She said, "This year there will be a lot of tears."
He can still appeal against his sentence.
F.A.: Air travel can now use gases in the air (but can't call the cell phone)
From entering the airway gate to reading, working, playing games, watching movies, listening to music, using their electronic device - but they can't talk to their cellphone - such a teacher continues to be part of the most anticipated new directional directions by the United Air Administration.
But travellers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference in F.A., administrator Michael Huarta said that how fast these changes are implemented would be different in each line.
Airlines will have to show how their aircraft, new directional directions, and how to update the training books and the rules for collecting the drivers' team members to show directional directions.
F.A. has said that it has already received plans from some airlines to extend the use of portable electronic devices on the plane.
Delta and Zetblu are among those who have already presented plans.
F.A. said in a statement, "On the basis of the state of the plan, we can accept the extended use of the electronic device very soon.
In the meantime, passengers need to close their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the air is closed.
They are expected not to proceed until they reach the altitude of 10,000 feet of the plane and are permitted by the Captain.
Travelers are expected to stop their device again when they land on the plane, and do not start until the plane is completely down.
F.A. said, New directional lines that are fully secure from electronic means can allow their passengers to fly by air, fly by air, and use the device during taxiing.
Most new airline companies and other aircraft that have been revised so that passengers can use a higher rate of wifi are expected to comply with these commands.
The president of the Association of Professional Flight Agents, Laura Glading, has welcomed these changes.
Glading said in a statement, "When the policy is safely implemented -- and we'll work with airlines to do that -- it'll be a win-win for both sides."
When it comes to this point, we've been snooping like Hall Monitors.
Agency said, however, that connecting to the Internet at less than 10,000 feet, providing e-mail, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data will still be prohibited.
Travelers will be told to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in an airplane mode.
So there can still be no conversation with friends, such as the online Scrible game, which is related to the famous event that when Acter Elek Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while the air was parked at the door in 2011, American Airlines dropped them off when they refused to stop the device.
And heavy equipment like laptops will still be collected because they'll be worried about hurting someone else in the cabin.
The phone call will continue to be blocked during the flight.
The administrative authority related to the phone call is near the communication foundation, not the F.A.
F.A. can remove restrictions on some electronic devices when flying and landing.
Last month, Mark Rojken, of the National Transportation Safety Unit, who is a national security expert at the B.B.S. News, said the cell phone is still being stolen.
Rožanker said, "The cell phone is really a serious issue, not just because they can possibly produce regulation in the navigation-related device, but also because they can produce regulation in the cell phone towers when they are in the air.
In order to examine this issue, the World Advisory Committee, organized by the F.A., established last month that the government should allow more use of personal electronic devices.
F.A. is increasing pressure in recent years to reduce restrictions on their use.
Mr. Claire McSchilk, like D-Mo, has said that there is no valid security reason for the ban.
These restrictions are becoming more difficult because the use of the device is widespread.
Some studies also show that almost three passengers forget or ignore orders to stop their device.
F.A. began banning the use of electronic devices by travelers in 1996, when the F.M. radio and the high-tech gadgets of the time were reported in navigation and communication devices.
New Airlines companies are more dependent on the electrical system than the last generation of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved to resist electronic intervention by the F.A.
Airlines has been proposing the use of wi-fi on cruise heights for years.
The revised aircraft for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to interference.
Huarta said that most airlines should be able to meet the requirements for more use of the electronic device within the new direction.
Today’s electronic device emits a very low-power radio transmission compared to the last generation electronic device.
For example, e-readers transmit the total number when the page is flipped.
But the transmission is powerful when downloading or sending data from the device.
Amazon.com is also one of the parties to the restriction of using the device by travellers.
In 2011, the company's authorities loaded their entire control e-readers into Airlines and sent him to investigate problems but no one found such a problem.
The F.A.A. Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the use of the device.
The Dagles Kid of the National Air Travel Association said that they believe that the device is real, even though it's a nomadic device.
Other members of the committee said that only pilot reports are described by pilots, most of which are very old, in support of decommissioned devices in the Aircraft system.
However, committee members suggested that the F.A.P.L. allow pilots to order the flight to stop the device when they are low in visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed changes and they are said to be a common feature of the knowledge of the people who travel in the most recent period of the industry.
U.S. Trawl Association C.I. Roger Doe said that we are pleased that the F.A. has recognized that a joyful traveler is not immune to safety, safety and safety.
Learning from the terrorist threats on the board, Utt Police has been able to find a room for quick reaction to the Meddenzer Divali's security, and during the time of the emergency.
All the major cities in the city of 1,800 will be patrolling and foot patrolling vehicles in all major cities, crowds of markets and other places.
These young people will include P.R.R., women with traffic units.
The city's hotels, guest houses, and other places with PGI will also be screened by police workers and commands on Twitter with caution.
THANA SCHO has been instructed to organize a special investment team (SIT) for the investigation of cases.
In addition, DSP with Jima Inspector has been assigned to check markets, malls and other locations with the city's VIP sectors.
In the wake of an emergency and a gala holiday, senior officials have also set a tweet for additional police workers in the people's welfare police control.
The police have been told to maintain a high level of seniority in addition to the administration of GMSH and 32 GMSH, as well as the staff of other dissidents, including the principal director and DHS.
In order to teach minds, the regional authorities have now put the others, including women police workers, in charge of Engio, named 'Anti Guda Staff' on Twitter.
The Anti Guda Staff team will be able to hold the minds of people in simple police clothes, including marketplaces.
All SCHOs have been ordered to put 44 noses in the inner areas of the city on the dial.
At the city's borders, 38 Naka points will also be stationed by police workers.
Birds were abandoned by air transport to the forest for security from the North Sea.
The birds found on the North C Oil Ridge are left behind by air transport to the forest.
The bird named this road train was sent by the Scottish SPCA before he was restored to his Eloa Rescue Center by Helicopter.
Central Administrator Colin Sedan said: "This road rail was probably a winter bird in northern Europe, which hit the wind in the north."
Looks like the bird was tired and he took refuge in the Oil Reg.
They said, “He was unable to fly again, so we were called to help.”
The road was healthy and healthy before leaving.
Is Europe ready to deal with Britain?
In April, Business For Britain was launched and the business was promised to bring together and determine what changes we want to see in our relationship with the U.K. journalist and the prospering U.K.
For him, we asked them what they thought about the business of Britain with the U.S. by organizing the largest and most extensive surveys of the business leaders in Britain.
U-Gov is responsible for the thinking of 1000 business leaders, representing the size of Britain's business, areas and places.
The conclusion of this survey may be surprising to many.
We found that a large proportion of businesses now want to export out of Europe, and that they want to focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while the EU member countries are running out of pace.
They want the government to give priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than to the long and bad process of reforming the U.S. mysteries.
When asked about specific policy areas such as the one-stop shop management, most business leaders believed that the control of these decisive capabilities should return to Westminster.
The single market could easily be seen as a source of unhappiness, the businessmen say that the cost of Brussels's administration is far more than the benefits of becoming part of Europe's trading area - even large businesses that were traditionally part of European companies, 40 percent of them agreed on this.
In the end, and most clearly, our investigation of practical leaders found that, a large part clearly wants Britain to move forward on the path of trade-based relations and changes in terms of trade with the U.S.
This conclusion, which was seen in the levels of the main business groups, showed that the operators are moving towards a "factory change" that would give the U.S. its lost power back.
It's a very high price - a 16 percent change in terms of terms for Britain and a better deal in non-collection, not on the side of staying in the U.S.
The prime minister should not be in any doubt: it is a condition that British businessmen support their plan to talk about British membership conditions in the U.S.
It also showed that businessmen expect to re-report a source change to the current power balance in the US side.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming mandatory very quickly, because the Eurozone, the prosperous economy and the political union are moving forward.
Priority must be employment and growth in Britain, as the conclusions of our survey show that it means a new central focus on trade and a change based on the management process of Brussels.
Alexi Miler of Gazprom told Pipeline in Bulgaria that a new era had begun
The Gazprom chief said that the start of the construction of the South Stream Pipeline in Bulgaria marked the start of Europe's largest energy projects.
"Today there has been a historic event: the construction of the Bulgarian part of the South Stream Gas Pipeline, which is the largest and most important project in Europe," Alexi Miler, president of Gazprom, said in a statement to Thursday.
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream will provide diversity in Russian export routes in Europe.
The authorities said that Ukraine, where the majority of Russia's gas for Europe is part of the gas, presents a judicious dialogue between the Gasprom Counterparter and the Gasprom.
Miler said that a member of the European Union means a direct connection to Bulgaria, ending the combined "for the past" with the countries of Pergamum.
After the whole project has started in 2015, Bulgarian customers will receive gas at the rates released from the South Stream.
Gazeprom said that the contraction should begin in other Downstream countries by the end of the year.
This pipeline is designed for the annual capacity of the 2.2 trillion cubic feet of nachoreal gas.

Prior to the accusations against Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission reported on two employees of the U.S.A.
Prior to the charge against Jonathan Lord, in 2011, caringbah was charged with the crimes of two employees of the U.S.S.D.Blu.
But in his statement to the Foundation, he said that it "has never been the case of child abuse within his organization," the Foundation was told.
Chief officer Philip Greene was asked about the case in which a member of the U.S.A. was charged with child pornography crimes and another case in which the U.S.C. Caringbah Jim Intruder was charged with child abuse against children living in his home in 1991.
Mr. Harre said they knew about the first case, but they didn't know about the second case.
They also admitted that the U.M.S.A.'s statement that "the outside of the U.S.A. has been tested and that they have found the U.S.A. to be the first in the field of child protection" is not true.
With respect to the foundation, it is evidence that WI.M.A. was notified, and this year it received a second rating in four possible ratings in education and community department quality audits in August.
Mi. Hare, who is associated with W.M.S.A. at the age of 21, admitted that the "self-with-me" arrangement has failed to appoint Lord, and it failed to ensure that workers were clearly aware of their duties related to informing child security policy violations.
In the beginning of this year, Lord, was convicted of juvenile crimes with 12 children during the two-year term in the U.S.A.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in Carabah.
But Mr. Greene refused the suggestion that there was a cultural problem in the U.S.A., which caused the workers not to report a violation of child protection by the Lord.
The workers gave what they saw about the violation, to the Witnesses who spent their time alone with the children by Lord, to make them selfless, to sit in their seats, to tell them that he loves them and to let them play on their mobile phone.
Daniel Oquell, who was in the custody of Lord, and he was speaking for the training of the Child Security, because he was concerned about his behavior, testified that the W.I.A., who was watching Lord's service with Caringba, was "hard to find the most threatening and time".
C.I. said he did not accept the witness of the workers that they were not easy to inform their manager.
He said, but their friendship with Lord has misled their decision to inform about him.
Mr. Harre said that he had given the W.M.S.A.N.S.D.Blu's opinion to the Assembly that the text for the organization "not to be informed" was from the "John Lord event".
Mr. Harre said that shortly after the charges were brought, the decision to sign a secret agreement was made by the Child Service Manager Liam Whitley.
He said it was intended to avoid interference with the witness, but it was not "enthusiast" and was not executed properly.
Professor Stephen Smallbon of the University of Griffith said that during the 2099s, the work of Jonathan Lord was not a safe organization during the 2099s.
He said the appointments, surveys, access, training and surveillance were "critical problems".
The hearing has been suspended for 20 December.
Blier says they want Britain back.
Tony Blair said they'd want to be Britain's prime minister again -- but they believe there's no way back.
On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of their education by the Prime Minister's office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various household nanites.
After leaving office as leader after a decade in June 2007, most of his comments on foreign affairs and the role of peacemakers in the Middle Group limited Mr. Blair's role to much avoid discussing British politics.
When asked if they would like to return to the Prime Minister's position, Mr. Blair was presented by the London standard evaning newspaper, saying, "Yes, yes, but it's not possible, so..."
They urged the leaders not to ignore the commercial community after the financial crisis.
When a crowd of experts were gathered to show the horse for the greatest horse in Cardiff, they knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not yet went to school and for a few months away from taking their first step, this little kid and his palate Sattland's Tutu Tafi easily completed three steps and won the top prize - he left behind his 30-year-old rivals.
In the annual contest organised by the Saniback Equestrian Center in the vicinity of Cardiff, a couple who could not be separated - who have long - were greatly praised for their appearance, behavior and style.
In front of men and women dressed in beautiful baller hats, he pushed his flat top on a bead and ringed his two-year-old tophy.
The decision-makers commended Fenton for his natural ability to control his age.
And Tofi got the highest score for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was given to Toffi as a gift on his third birthday last March, and since then he has studied with this tattoo in everyday Scotland.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Tony are a wonderful couple."
They had to face all expectations, but they both won gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time he was involved in a competition with Toffi, and we are all very happy to win it.
The most different in this color, he seemed so wonderful to everyone that they wanted to take pictures with him.
Eb Well, near Nantiglo village of South Wales, this young child is walking on his aunt Sharon Howells' tracks that have been showing horses for more than 10 years.
Mr. Howells said: "The whole place was filled with excitement, and everyone was enjoying himself and playing."
He was running to and fro in all the field, and did extraordinary things in spite of the appearance of his eyes.
Fenton's wild animals -- he's very fond of horses, tractors and fields, and he's got two birds he's taking care of.
As he started, he would be the greatest horse in the year long -- and I trust he would be very good at showing.
The speaker for the annual horse show said, "Fenton's life is only three years, but he's coming to control his bow."
They're very good together.
The decision-makers gave the figures in the presentation of Fenton and Toffi and their presentation in the show ring.
He saw good team work between Tatu and his riders - the best in the Fenton and Tofi ring in the case.
I fully believe that Fenton's loving clothes helped him, he was really looking very different.
The Chinese newspaper that argues will be a "declaration"
A Chinese newspaper, which had an appeal on the front page to leave Manhani's guilt, will be rescinded, said a press leader.
The New Express of Guangzhou provided a real public argument for the release of journalist Chen Yongjo.
But after that, Mr. Chen agreed on TV that he had agreed to write a thorough report on the company's share of the government.
Winyamk said that the new expression now has to go through "full improvement".
The "sweet" command came from the publication, radio, film and television administration of Guangdong Press.
"A primary test showed that the New Express of the Younging Evanning News Group had published many false news about the Listed Company Jumloin in the mid-September 2012 period.
Winyamk said in a statement "The editorial arrangement of the new expression was unorganized."
He said he decided to punish an administrative penalty by canceling the licence of Chen Yongjo's reporter.
He directed the "Engang Evening News Group to complete a reform of the new expression, to investigate responsible people in the new expression and to immediately investigate the leadership of the new expression."
Mr. Chen wrote many articles condemning financial irregularities in a company called Jomloin.
After they were released, their newspaper published two headlines for their release, and said that he supported Mr. Chen's journalism.
But after that, Mr. Chen agreed to write and publish false stories about money on Kingdom TV.
He told C.C.T.V.: "In this case, I have damaged the ability to win the entire news media industry and people's faith."
I did this mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I've become aware of my mistakes.
After Mr. Chen's apology, New Express continued to apologize, saying it had failed to check their report correctly.
In recent years, many high-profile individuals have adopted widespread misconceptions about TV.
Experts say that time-to-time convictions are strongly accepted, although a law in the north of this year prohibited authorities from forcing a person to blame themselves.
From 23 November to 23 November, Mr. Hanman will text the anti-terrorist president of the National Anti-Front Front in the text of Mr. Handragit Singh Bbita with 10 thousand children in the Dana People's Parliament.

They praised Mr. Hindu justice's efforts to unite children with everlasting culture.
He said that children also need to be taught religious teachings with worldly education for the unity and infinity of the country.
The U.S.-Mexico drug mine found its own rails in a mine.
One of the most complex drugs in Mexico, U.S.A., has been found with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U.S. officials have described four feet of property as one of the most complex secret ways of searching for three feet.
The funnel is about six feet long, which connects Tijuana, close to Mexico and San Diego, U.S.S.A.
This area is filled with a kind of good, which makes it easy to hide a drug-filled truck.
The authorities said that it had been closed before a drug was released from the mine.
According to the court's records, the authorities have imposed eight hundred and forty-eight tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine on the search of the mine.
Three people, about whom the authorities reported that they were operating as drivers, were charged with being placed in Marijuana and Cookin for distribution.
If they are guilty, they may be punished from 10 years of age until they die.

The British police sent an offer note to Asanze
The British police sent a letter to Julian Asanze, the founder of Wiklix, today, who has taken refuge in the embassy of Ecuador in London and applied for refuge.
Scotland Yard said that he sent 40-year-old Australian Assay a "dedication note", which would require them to attend the police station, and said that if they failed to do so, they would themselves be responsible for being arrested.
As well, young offenders are facing a surrender in Sweden, as well as their options under British law ended at the time when the Supreme Court rejected their appeal against the surrender at the beginning of this month.
Stokhom would send them to the U.S., with this fear they called from the South American country for political refuge, had applied for refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London on June 19th.
One speaker said that Scotland Yard sent "40-year-old Asanze a suicide note that required them to attend the police station on the date and time they were chosen for."
They are in violation of the conditions of their strength.
The authorities refused to comment on the submission of police notices.
Asanje is afraid that United States will be asked to deal with possible YS-accidents in Sweden, due to the release of over 250,000 political cables on a confidential website called Wiklix.

The College Master's Court of Justice has accepted the undertaking to drive in vain.
They added seven points to their license, which has resulted in a six-month restriction on driving.
Hovi was also ordered to charge 90 pounds (£90) and 100 pounds (£100).
Performing foreign property on owners, will end London's operational position
The financial department has calculated the C.G.T. plans preferably, but is awaiting the final decision from Mr. Osborn, who presented seven percent of the stamp tweets for the 2012 budget of 2 million pounds, as well as the person who prefers to have a home in a company instead of a different person.
In 2012/13, there were 708 million pounds of stamps from residential property in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, which are already more than the combined sum of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, North West and Yorkshire and Hamber.
Mr. Cook said: "After an increase in the stamp duty of high-value houses and an Association of Anti-Avoidance statement has been presented, it is very difficult to argue that there is less tax on the high-value component, which is not related to the effects of the system since it was old.
They added, "But this step can make some foreign immigrants reluctant to buy wealth in London and to sell existing owners."
The top 5 to 10 percent of the housing market in rich South-West London, which is spread from Fulham to Vimbledon, has increased 11.8 percent last year's record.
According to the search for Seville, the values of Central London continued to increase regularly at 5.6 per cent each year, but there was a slight increase compared to the "home market" because the city's southern west, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent).
Scientists have also shed light on the relationship between the dog's bird's activities and its mud.
Recent research has shown that happy dogs move their tail more to the right (from the point of view), while bechan dogs move their tail more mainly to the right.
But now scientists have said that partners can identify and respond to this narrow secret of dogs.
This study has been published in the Journal of the Court of Justice.
From the University of Trento, neuroscientist Professor Georgia Wellertigara said: "People know that the left and right parts of the brain are different from that which produces positive or negative emotions."
We've tried to see it here in other nations as well.
They told him, "The right hand of the skull was responsible for the work of the left hand, and for the reverse. The two tails of the harts played different roles in their emotions."
To learn more about how dogs react to each other's movements through other dogs, the investigators looked at animals in the movies of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the native dogs and analyzed their behavior.
We probably won't take more time to understand why their tail ever moves to the other side.
Proo. Wellertigara said: "We presented dogs with dog movies - in a shadow-image to deal with other points that were being presented in the exactist version or in the confusion, and we could see the work of the bird and present the bird on the left or on the right."
And when the beasts saw that they moved upon their tails, then they were at ease.
But when they saw the bird shifting to the left, their hearts were lifted up, and they were calm.
According to Pro. Wellertigar, they don't think dogs were communicating with each other through these things.
Instead, they believe that dogs have learned from their experience what activity they should be concerned about and not about.
They said, "If you have found other dogs, and if they keep on moving their wings, it is more likely that they will have a relationship with you, and the right hand will have a lower degree of friendship than you have, and you will respond by the same experience."
Researchers say that these conclusions can provide better information about animal emotions to owners, animal physicians and trainers.
John Bradshaw, an expert in dog behavior at the University of Bristol School of Veterinary Sciences, said that it is not the first study to examine whether the left or right part of the dog is important.
Last year, a team at the University of Linking found that when dogs look at a ferocious dog, they turn their heads to the left and turn their heads to the right when they see the happy dog.
In another search for the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "In contrast to Italian study - when the robot dog was moved to the left of the bird's right, it was more likely that the dog would be ill rather than near it."
He said that this was because dogs in various studies didn't fully understand dogs in animal movies or robots.
They explained that this could help to study how dogs react to real dogs.
"Since the various stems have found enough evidence that the two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more information is still available - and there are no dog exceptions in this case," he said.
Although, in view of the ease with which their conduct can be recorded, we may not think that we will have more time to understand why their two sometimes move to each other.
Because of Alex Turner’s illness, Arctic Manchus stopped Glasgo Giga
Rock Bank, the Arctic Manchiz, has stopped Giga in Glasgow after being beaten by his main singer.
On Friday, the Sheffield Group program was set to show on the Hidro site in the city.
But their leading singer Alex Turner's disease forced them to redefine the date of the show.
The announcement of the band came at the time when they were obliged on Thursday to stop Giga in LG Erina in Burma in the same way.
In commenting on his official website, Arctic Manchus said: After taking medical advice tonight, after the decision to stop showing in Bermuda LG Erina, Arctic Manchus must also be stopped at Glasgo Hydro on Friday.
"Alex Turner was found upset in the junk, and they're hardly capable of displaying."
The show will be held in LG Erina in Burma on 20 November now, and the exhibition will be held on 21 November in Glasgo Hydro.
All tickets will be accepted for this show.
We're sorry for any inconvenience that's going to happen to all the ticket-holders.

Pope Francis will announce the name of the first Cardinal in February
Vatican has announced Thursday that Pope Francis will create a new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his work on February 22.
Cardinals, in the Catholic Church, have the highest-ranking clergy, their position only goes down from the pope, and they choose the pope, so France will select the first group of their people, who will eventually help them choose their successor.
Now there are 201 cardinals.
Similarly, after 80 years of age, Cardinal is not allowed to participate in the pop election - it comes in a group of 120 "cardinal electors".
In a speech announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Fedrico Lombardi said that before the New Cardinals are proposed, meetings of all current Cardinals, called the Pope, will be held.
Lombardy said, "Pop Francis has decided to announce his decision to organise the February Pop-Farvary, so as to make it easier to make plans for other meetings involving Cardinals from different countries in the world."
Jack Valero of Catholic Voyage said it was possible to decrease the number of cardinal electors by February.
He said that the pope generally proclaims the number of cardinal electors less than 120, as Cardinals, and as they wish, more than 80 years of age.
Valero said that the next year's Pope's meeting would be important, because this year, after the election of France, this will be the first Pope's meeting.
At present, Europe and especially Italy have a kind of prejudice.
He said, "It'll be interesting to see if the new pope, the other cardinals, are thinking about rebalancing the balance.
There are forty percent of Roman Catholics in South America, but their number in Cardinals is very low.
Cardinals by France - a group of eight cardinals from all over the world whose work seeks to improve the way of the church, will also be the first cardinals to be selected after the establishment.
Before that, the pope made all the decisions of his own.
Valero said, "Now France has chosen these eight cardinals to help themselves."
He said it's "possible" to seek advice from the French Cardinals.
But we're not in this situation first - it's completely new.
Valero said that the pope usually appoints the bishop of large places as cardinals, but France "were quite surprising -- so we don't know who they're going to name."
In order to fix Seatback, gm has called back to the U.S.
On Friday, according to a report by the U.S. Auto Security Managers, the General Motors Company, has called back about 19,000 tracks in a hand-circuited seat in Shiverle Silvado and G.M.C. to correct a decrease in the number of tracks.
Some tracks may be lost in the front seat rotation system.
As a result, the Union has failed to comply with the safety standards for sitbacks.
According to a report from the National Police Department on the Security Administration website, "If the vehicle is hit from the rear, it may not be able to protect the headrest, the driver's proper way of protecting the driver, which will increase the injury."
Callback models were created between 1 August and 10 September.
This represents the most important Wahan Launch for the US Automecar after the 2009 update.
G.M. told the trok masters about this charge in October.

G.M. told Friday that the sales of Silvado and Sierra Track, which had been redesigned for the 2014 model year, were 20 percent in the previous 10 months.
In October, G.M. sold 42,660 Silverade and 16,503 Sira pickup tracks.
Friday afternoon in New York Stock Exchange had a 1.4 percent increase in the GM share.
The Discouragement of Obama’s Thoughts
I gave Obama twice as much as I expected.
They say the U.S.P. policy has forced Obama's great efforts to stop him.
Obamacaire’s policy can’t alleviate the suffering of the website, drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 Campen Memorial reminds us of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris Harvard Medical School is a second-year student.
I'm reading very painful books today.
It's a book that I think this second year will boost my enthusiasm and give me hope.
Its name is "the courage to live", and it is a commemoration of the 2008 presidential election campaign by Barak Obama.
When I get up at night with the doctors of my disease and go to bed, this book takes me to a time where politics has driven millions of people and the talk could stop your breath.
The election proved to be a one-off, and news speakers took a break to show the historical significance of the time.
The tears of joy were in the eyes of my companions; and my father and my mother kept the letter of every one that was received.
A group of young remote people were going to the White House, and the whole country was ready to change.
In 2008, they had 82 percent of their license ratings as President of Obama.
Then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, like returning from the world of dreams.
It is hard to remember those days of hope: they seem to be a long way off, a painful memory of lost occasions.
I actually changed the first time I got married.
Just say, none of this could have imagined.
I thank Obama for his many resources, from the Afordable Cairo Act to the return of our army from Iraq, "Don't ask," to end the killing of Osama Bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that the principle of anti-punity has prevented many efforts to move forward in our country: including public access to non-viable improvements, public access to health services, the closure of Guantanamo Bay, and others.
But the many times I've been taking the side of Obama's administration with my colleagues and colleagues, and I've got the answer that I can give them.
I have reached the point of political disillusionment.
The opposition of the Republican policy is not the answer to the harassment of foreign leaders, nor is it the answer to drone attacks on children in foreign countries.
This national security agency cannot answer the data about the personal life of US citizens nor can it answer the business of people who expose the wrong actions of the government.
It can't explain why American citizen Unver El was killed without a trip, nor the public and civil limits were reduced during the President's campaign.
It cannot answer the conclusions of the report, which says that the efforts to silence the media by the White House have been the most shocking since the Nixon administration.
And lastly, it cannot help designing a simple website even after three years of being signed in the law of Afordable Cairo Act.
I don't know if I expected it.
If, at 18 years of age, I should have assumed that the regime could break the political campaign that led it forward.
It is clear that the outstanding office is not a prelude, because opposing political parties and commemorative events such as the Newtown Homicide will give the size of our public discussion.
However, as many examples I have given above, they seem mostly chosen by the administration.
This is the most disturbing thing you've ever had to do.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was curious about his hope.
Mit Romani presented a liberator and an unspecified option that did not seem to determine their motives or position.
I thought that there would be another work for Obama, which would be free from the pressure of future choices, to fulfill the hopes that we have been listening to for a long time.
However, while Obama's permit rating is less than 45 per cent this week, it has become very difficult to return from the book in 2008.
I can see him and remember their promises.
He was reading a portion of the book this week, which described the way in which Clinton was damaged by Obama in the Pennsylvania Prime Minister.
In a post-martam campaign meeting, he told his subordinate workers that they needed to return to the panel, and that they needed to remain faithful to their goals.
He said, "I want my mojo back."
We must remember who we are.'
Five years later, I cannot agree with you anymore.
The thoughts expressed in this comment are of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claimed that P.M. Tony Abbot's best fight about the planet's vacation plan.
Arabpet M.P. Clive Pamer said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott's fight about the Patriotic Holiday Plan is good because their daughters can get pregnant and can benefit from it.
The mayor of the crime area, who has charged 6 million dollars to Bill's payout, has claimed to be in dispute, while he has tried to answer questions about the conflict.
The Pomer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which can be important to determining the reduction of carbon and fossil fuels.
But Mr. Palmer has claimed that only the good fight between ministers can be, and said that the girls of Mr. Abbott can benefit personally from the fates.
Mr. Pammer said, "They may have a major good fight in the matter of parental leave, because if any of them were pregnant, they would have a clear right to be given leave or not."
Two months after the election, the election foundation officially declared Mr. Pamer to be the winner of the Sunshine Cost Seat of the Firefax.
Mr. Pamer asked for the election to move forward quickly.
Toni Aut's daughters, French and Bridget.
Should the outcome of the choice be two months after we have been judged?
They said, "We must have a better system."
Why can't we have a system in which we fill our computer distributions, immediately vote, and have results at 6:30 p.m.
Mr. Pamer also examined the use of pencils to mark the fingerprints.
For if a man doesn't like him, can he destroy him?
The use of pencils today seems totally useless.
The selection foundation, is studying options for electronic analysis, and has recently issued an integrated browser letter with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Pamer said their findings included the creation of an international air stop for Sunshine Coast, and they would take their new work "very seriously".
Public office is for public service.
They said: "We have been granted the bounties of history, so that we may serve the people at a time that is not far off from us."
The same was made to err in the matter of them that contended.
Addressing the meeting on this occasion, the Association president Ramesh Singh Negi voiced a strong appeal to the corrupt law system in the country.
He said, "The leaders and their families are quick to attack, and the criminals have become fearless."
They have no fear of the police and the administrative system.
He recently mentioned such events in different places, saying that when the president's society is not safe, the security of the common man can be easily calculated.
RBS suspended two forext trades
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign currency exchange department, the information received from two scientists from the case, another indication that the global speed of testing is moving ahead at the global speed of the money market's benchmark.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Dush Banks and RBS, have confirmed that the world's largest financial market in which $5.3 trillion is donated daily, is being co-operated with investors.
These two traders will be the first employees of RBS, who have been suspended by a review of the situation that appears to be a repetition of the liberator interface.
Bank has refused to comment on Nialmbun and has confirmed that the bank has received a request for information from policymakers this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank said, "We've been investigating this case, and we're fully cooperating with FCA and other investors."
Last month, the case scientists said that RBS sent the former trader and sent the e-mails and rapid messages to the UK Legal, Financial Behavioral License.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010, and is believed to have been released from this current position by the European leader of Forex Spot Trading in J.P.M.
Rohan Ramodani, head of the European Spot Trading in City last week, was suspended by the Standard Charter in Barclayz and UBS.
None of these traders have been charged with wrongdoing.
From the case, scientists have reported that M.E.'s rapid message group includes Barclayz and Sitigrup's banks.
UBS said that, after being told by Swiss Williams that she is investigating foreign currency market benchmarks in many Swiss backpacks, she has been working against some of her employees this week.
At least six publications at global level - the European Foundation, the Film Foundation, the Swiss Competition Office, the Justice Department at FCA, and the Hong Kong Medical Office - are investigating allegations of abuse in order to secure their proper disposal in the money market.
The case has been reported by known people that HSBC, Citigrup, J.P.Morgan, and Credit Switzerland have also been subjected to internal checks, or have received requests for information from policymakers.
Banks are checking for speedy messages and e-mails for several years in search of a bad deal.
The report on the exams has given rise to confusion in trades in areas that have been among the most profitable in the trading unit of admission banks over the past several years, but they are facing this year's challenge, because of the low-strength in Corncez.
Some bankers have tried to push the case into saying that it is impossible to transfer very large and too much liquid foreign currency to the exchange market, but top traders say it doesn't have to be true.
Supreme Trader said that foreign currency distribution between the different trading platform and the increasing use of its own platform by banks means that "you can start to influence the market at a low price."
The news came the same day that Credit Swiss announced his Exchange Traded Funds from the desk in London that he had announced this week's service, which had lost nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank has immediately announced consistent authorisations and is cooperating with its investors.
Credit Switzerland said, "We believe that the trader has worked alone and has been controlled."

The Supreme Court upheld Obama’s health service law
As a major victory for Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared the Health Service Law on behalf of Barak Obama.
From 5 to 4 opinions, the judges decided on the basis of a separate order of the Health Security and the National Care Act - which would require citizens to buy or punish health diseases before 2014, that it was in a position to notify the government.
Chief Justice John Robert supported four other members of the Court of Justice, while other judges were inconvenient.
The court has also supported the rest of the paragraphs of this law by the 2700 pages, and said that the health service law is not partially affected by the condition that the state medicine will increase or that all the federal medical funds will be fed.
It was brought by the U.S. of 26 states, as well as the National Free Trade Association, to stop this law.
During the opening session of 2012, the law was opposed by all major Republican Presidents, including project-designated people, Mitt Romaniani.

Believe in the first president elected freely in Egypt
Muhammad Morsi has taken an oath of office, but his day of victory in Egypt may have ended the political struggle.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised "New Egypt" when he promised to take office as the first independent president of the country to take over Hosni Mubarak, 16 months ago.
In front of the Supreme Constitutional Court on its official establishment, Morsi Arab has become the fifth national president of Egypt, the independent first Islamic president of the world, and nearly 60 years ago.
And they took an oath of the oath by the hand of the 18 judges who had lied to the black men of the court at their courses, beside the river Nile, which was as the ancient Egyptian temple.
Morsi said during a live performance on national television: "We are looking forward to a better future, new Egypt and the other republic."
The terrorist group Muslim Bradredwood, who has spent 84 years as an illegal organization since its establishment, and who is on the mark of previous governments, U.S.A. trained engineer 60-year-old Morsi, said that "Egyptians today have laid the foundation of a new life - complete freedom, true democracy and stability."
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen protected the building and, according to local time, came to Morsi's small car cafe shortly after 11 o'clock.
Only a few hundred supporters have been gathered outside the court to conjure up the president's smoke-off from the President's office since March, even for a short time, so that their engines can leave the busy road, which connects the city centre to its southern suburbs.
In the personal dignity of Morsi, who was ridiculed as a non-Critical "tairs" of Bradhead, they increased greatly after winning, and on Friday, their speech presented them not only as an Islamist but as a hope for all those who want to carry out the task of the 2011 Revolution against the Tsunish March.
Morsi, dressed in a blue-colored business suit and red-coloured tai, took a stand against judges sitting in the wooden panelroom, saying that today Egypt is a national, moral, and modern nation.
After that, they went to the University of Morsi Cairo, where they had to give their opening talk.
The military band played national smoke and welcomed their officials while they were standing in the currency of the warning.
Military governor Field Marshall Husan Tantavi was also present.
On their arrival, hundreds of people in the Chamber of Understanding at the University welcomed the call "the army and the people are one hand".
Founded in 1908 as the foundation of independent education, Cairo University later became the foundation of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath in Tahrir Squier, which is the origin of the province, which ended the Tanasha regime of Bucharest last year, and pledged to take back the powers of the President who had been removed from their position by the military coup last year.
But by agreeing to take a legally binding oath to the court rather than to accept a legally binding oath, they have succumbed to the will of the army, which indicates that the struggle for the government will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Squier was filled with dramatic popular coins.

Welcome to the Cabinette meeting.
At the end of the meeting, the lion praised Nerendra Modi's speech for responding to the attack by the chief minister.
He also said about his speech that they have no other feelings.
They want the party to be strong.
To meet new challenges.
The main minister's face also felt that they had taken the lion's speech in a positive way.
It is known that the lion urged the officials to honor and protect them from the persecution of the officers in the Sintan camp.
Although they were also told that they were ready to speak to the Ministry.
Similarly, after the opinion of the Minten Chamber, there is the hope of new thinking in the matter of putting workers on government positions.
In the camp, district Jadiu President Naraina lion said that the action will soon be announced by the activists in the 20-story committees.
Their signal was that the list is almost ready.
The news is that the Prime Minister is now measuring the list from his own level.
They'll also check if the idea of divorcées-sancists has been made up to form the list.
If required, sizes of the list will be changed to replace the old and the changed operators.
The general charge of fugitives is that they were not taken into account in the establishment of the Mandonion List.
The names of the people who came from other groups have been included in the list of people who have been active since the days of the party.
Some people are born with silver, and some by their labors make life a model, and they are inspired by them.
There is also a name for self-patience in the same personalities.
A small village in Gujarat was born on December 28, 1932, the third son of Hirrachand Goverdadas Imbani, a teacher at a school in the village of Storovad.
The patience of the five brothers was the third.
The five sons of the family include Ramanikal, Netter red, patience, and two sisters, trilling and the like.
Because of economic hardship, tolerance had to be abandoned only after high school.
Patience had begun to help the house financially in childhood.
At that time, they were building a temple store near the valley, limited to the number of visitors coming here.
Talking about the first job of patience, they arrived at Eden, Yemen, from the ship called Kabota, in 1949.
Their older brother Ramnikal had kept all the laws for them here, so they had no trouble finding a job abroad.
But there was something else going on in the mind of patience.
So in 1954 they returned to the estate.
In 1955, Mumbai received 500 dollars of money in the pocket.
And this is where their practical journey began.
The patience of Embani increased so much that he never looked back again.
Their name was not a nation, but a people for many nations.
Persuasive Imbani was released from the world on July 6, 2002.
At the time, they owned 62000 million dollars.
Their sons, Mukash, are now taking care of their kingdom.
Like Father today, the names of these two brothers are numbered in international business.
Who Today Do Not Know the Immaculate Family?
Patience, Kokilaben, two sons, Mukash and Anil Imbani, and their wives, Naita Imbani and Tina Imbani.

The Awakening Bureau, Sri Lankar: The police have removed the security of the former minister slave Hasan Minan, who joined the Peoples Democratic Party in Congress.
Khan told the government responsible for this that they have been removed from political security for political reasons.
It is noted that the Ministry of Public Health, who won the election in 2002, was included in the Ministry of Public Health, which was the head minister of the Department of Public Health.
Slave Hanson Khan said I've had a security quota since 1996.
I live in the caves of terrors.
I had a security hand on my house with CRPF in charge of all the inspectors.
I've got guards with me, but last night all my security was taken right away.
When the security hand was leaving my house, I spoke to the devout and the devout.
But instead of restoring security, he just said he'd check the case.
In this context, however, when IGP Abdul Gani Mir of Kashmir was contacted, he denied the information of the case that it was a sensitive matter.
I will examine myself how a former minister and senior leader's security has finally been removed.
The country Congress Chief Pro. Safudin Soz said that I know nothing about it.
It's very serious if you've been compromised with the security of the smile.
I'm in the Jammu at this time, and I'm coming in the next two days.
I will discuss this issue with the related administration.
According to this report, the U.S. government has spent $8.5 million over the last four years to tackle the problem of the master panel.
In contrast to Modi's claims, no announcement was issued by the government over the panel during the period between 1999 and 2004.
On Thursday, Modi, holding the image 'Stau of Unity' of 182 meters high of the main panel in Gujarat, said, 'before that there was no announcement on the occasion of the directors' panels.
While the DVD record reports that the US has spent $30 million in 2009-10, €4.10 million in 2010-11, €2.7 million in 2011-12, and €1.4 million in 2012-13.
When central information was asked about Modi's claims by Minister Manicht Tivari, he said that he does not speak on the basis of the PM candidate facts of Bzepi.
The U.S.A. did not receive a notice on the panel in 2008.
Tivari said it was because of the financial crisis that year.
Although the fees spent on the announcements of the chief panel are far less than the fees spent on members of the Neo-Song family each year.
DVP was spent on print advertisements for 33 million for the glory and dignity of the Grand Duchy, 21 million for the East PAM, 14.5 million for the Indira, and $9.38 million for the Red Neuru.
When Manich Tivari asked him about this distance, he said, "It should not be seen in the light of the cost of advertising."
Because the price of advertising depends on a number of things, including the size of the advertising or the rate of advertising for that year, etc.
The real thing is that this shows our dedication, which the opponents are trying to maintain without going about it to a great leader's legacy.
This day shall they meet the families of the men that were slain in the field, on the other side of the valley, on the last day.
Just a week after the attack, Narendra Modi's return to the security force was attacked.

Advances from soil, rivers, and forests to provide free medical services
Dr. Georges Welle is serving in rural Cameroon
Wells and their gangs see hundreds of diseases every week
There are not many doctors in West African countries; only 5,000 people have one doctor.
Put your vote here or use your cell phone
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 leaders of the N.N. in 2013.
You can vote for them or for someone in the top 10 to make the N.N. of the year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen his sick father come to mind and faint, going to the hospital, who were not adequately equipped to help them.
Jamel Welle was injured in a car accident near Cameroon’s capital, Cameroon, in 1981.
At first, their hands were only broken, but an infection increased that spread to their brains, and he created blood clots that affected their rest of their lives.
Georges Well says, "There was no neurosurgery in Cameroon."
If we had the money, we'd take our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Val took her father, and many multitudes of clinicians and hospitals, and all they could get.
He said, “It is not easy.”
You leave the house five o'clock in the morning, hoping you'll be the first person to reach the hospital, but that's not the case.
There's a lot of disease there.
Some men can wait for death.
There have been few changes in the situation since the death of Val's father in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one physician for every 5,000 people.
If you compare, there's a doctor for every 413 people in United States.
And if they be there, there shall no more be that many of the inhabitants of Cameroon be able to spend.
Two out of five people live below the poor line, and about two thirds of the land's health care is private.
Well says, "Their only problem is poverty."
And because they are poor, they cannot make their lives glad.
And when he saw the affliction of his father, and of his kindred, he took counsel to do after it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have cured 700 free blood cells last year.
They became doctors themselves, and began working as a student surgeon at the Center Hospital of Yonde.
And they started a non-profit organisation, Escowim, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical services.
Since 2008, he and his volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday they and almost 30 people sit in the baths, the doctors take care of the victims and go to rural areas where people need to be treated.
They don't even have the kind.
They push more than once into the river, and out of the dust they push forward.
But when they arrive, they are truly given the greatest privilege: the best home to be offered by the poets, the singer, the dancer, and the community.
In these villages, free medical services are actually the cause of hell, and wells - with their great smile and endless energy - are happy to be included.
The next morning, their group starts meeting hundreds of patients.
He said, "We are meeting 500 people on each trip."
They come from the village about 60 miles (60 km) away, and they come on foot.
They provide clinical services of a variety of types throughout the week.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, diabetes, diabetes, and chronic diseases.
Others can get a certificate of Bishkek, a gifted glass or a free birth -- the school needs this document, but many poor families cannot afford it.
The team just checks with local communications in the evening.
The operation usually takes place at the school's house, the Town Hall or the house; after the process, the disease goes to the recovery site, and makes room for the next person.
The group publishes sanitary devices in the operating room, and wakes up in the morning and the rest of the week.
It's a drumming speed, but the village musicians usually help to keep the band moving.
He said, "They are making fun of us all night long to keep us alive and to keep us busy."
Their company returns to the city on Sunday. They are weary, but they are proud for their work.
This group -- including Cameroon's medical and foreign medical students -- has cured 700 non-free medical doctors last year, and they know that their help can change the world of those they help.
One person said that because of being treated with non-pregnant Hernia, he would be able to go back to work.
He said, “This is what my future holds, and the future of my family.”
In addition to running clinics and operating as salutary surgeons in the hospital during the week, they also work in private medical clinics around the clock at night.
They said this is their second job, which pays 60 percent of their worthless work; the rest is paid by private donations.
In Philadelphia, Drexel University's second year medical student and volunteer at the Well Group said, "I don't know when they're asleep."
They're always in the hospital, or they're trying to make money for their organization, to keep doing these exercises.
This is a useful opportunity for medical students and nurses who come from United States and Europe to join the Wall campaign, such as O'Malley, to join their country.
O'Malley said, "We help in medicine for Dr. Well or in cleaning blood clots, we're able to gain useful experience in them."
You will never be able to do that as a second-year medical student in America.
Voluntary students usually work on their own to get to Cameroon, and they often come with donations.
But after the years are come, their habitation shall be desolate, and their dwelling places shall be desolate.
O'Millions say, "There is no doubt that they are heroes."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help Cameroon's people is never over.
For Well, it's not a burden, it's not a burden.
To help others to live a happy life, to fulfill the promise of their Father, these are things that bring them great joy.
Well says, "I'm very happy to do this."
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, reduce their pain.

You're not sure, but it's true.

Modi was clearly responding to Sibble, who said in Delhi that Modi wanted their controlling environment where they gave their speech and did not speak to them to avoid questions from journalists.
