Bosnia protests Croatia's plans for the storage of radioactive waste
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in northern and western Bosnia in protest against the neighbouring plans of Croatia for the storage of part of the only nuclear power plant in the region near the border with Bosnia and the main river known as natural beauty.
Demonstrators in the Bosnian city of Novi Grad demanded that Croatia charge plans to build waste storage in former military barracks in the town of Trgovska Gora and declared the war against the project.
The facility would contain waste from Krško nuclear power plant.
The Bosnians, holding banners with the words "I want a healthy future" and "Stop – (river) Una needs us," said that the storage of radioactive waste can endanger the Union's river and the lives of about 250,000 inhabitants.
We don't have to say,
He told the crowd Miroslav Drljac, mayor of the village of Novi Grad.
We have to fight to protect our way of life and our Union.
Located in Slovenia, the Krško power plant built in the 1980s is also for Croatia.
The representatives of both countries will meet next week to discuss additional waste storage issues.
The Croatian public television HRT said on Friday that it was not yet decided in Croatia whether to build waste storage on its own or to pay for the storage of part of the waste in a new facility built by Slovenia.
Croatian Minister of Environment and Energy Tomislav Coric told reporters that Croatia also has a problem with the use of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons and hopes for a comprehensive solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents on each side of the country's ethnic division insisted that Croatia find another location in part of the country closer to the power plant.
"Why does Croatia throughout its territory claim that this is the best place in Bosnia?" asked Drljac.
We can't let them down!

US Congress agreed to sell Poland 32 F-35 aircraft
The Congress of the United States, for a period of 15 days after approval by the Department of the State of Any Purchase by Poland, did not object to this transaction, which means that the last condition was met before the start of the procurement negotiations.
The Congress decision, although it was not unexpected, is of great political importance.
"After approval of the sale by the State Department, and now by Congress, I see no major obstacles," said John V. Venable, the Senior Council of Defence Policy of the Washington, a conservative think of the Heritage Foundation tank.
The expert explained that under the 1976 Law on the Control of Arms Exports, the federal government, represented by the Department of State, must notify Congress of any planned arms sales abroad 15 days before signing the contract if the value of such a transaction, in the case of the sale of arms to the NATO Member State, exceeds 50 million dollars.
The value of the proposed purchase of 32 F-35 fishermen by Poland is estimated at 6.5 billion dollars. This amount includes technical and logistical assistance, auxiliary equipment and pilot training.
The main supplier of F-35 - if this transaction is finally finalized - will be the US armed group Lockheed Martin, and its subcontractor is the manufacturer of engines for F-35A fishermen of Pratt and Whitney.
The proposals for the purchase of American fishermen of the fifth generation F-35, on behalf of the Polish authorities, have been made by the Minister of Defence Mariusz Blaszzak in May.
The Polish offer was discussed in June of the current year at the meeting of President Andrzej Dudy and President Donald Trump in the White House.
If the agreement is finalised, the representatives of the Pentagon will be held under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) programme.
As part of the FMS programme Poland has already acquired, among other things, the Patriot anti-racite system.
The price of one F-35 fisherman at the time of the purchase offered by Poland was – without arms and technical assistance – approximately 89.2 million dollars.
As the US military experts who wanted to maintain anonymity informed the PAP, the price given in the preliminary negotiations was "a maximum price, much higher than the price to be negotiated".
"The prices are falling violently, the price of one F-35 is now less than $80 million, much less than Eurofighter, who does not have the benefits of F-35," said Venable.
The PAP spokespersons hoped that the final negotiations on the purchase of US aircraft by Poland would end this year.
The possible participation of Polish subcontractors in this transaction, i.e. offset, will be addressed directly to the US F-35 fishermen producers.
What is the deputy Münchhausen team, referred to in the series "The Payton Hobart Choices" on the Netflix platform?
Caregivers and parents with the above disorder seem to be ill with their healthy child.
The "Payton Hobart's Choices" series is on the Netflix platform today.
He tells the story of Payton Hobart, who wants to become president of the United States, but first he has to become president of the academic self-government in his high school.
In Ryan Murphy's series, authors "American Horror Story" and "Glee", we'll see Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Platta and Lucy Boynton.
Without revealing too many details for those who have not yet had the opportunity to see the show, he is moving on the subject of the Münchhausen team, a mental illness occurring in caregivers, as if the health person concerned had been affected by a physical or mental illness.
There are different types of this disorder, such as the Munich team that is responsible for causing symptoms of the disease.
The Münchhausen team is based on the simulation that the person who remains under our care has certain concerns.
It is also called a invented and caused disease, and it is treated as violence against the child.
It's a rare disorder that usually involves a parent who's taking over symptoms or causing symptoms, so it looks like his child's sick.
What are the symptoms of the Münchhausen team?
The symptoms of this disease may vary, but NHS points to the following examples of behaviour:
Medical personnel believe, however, that a healthy child feels bad.
Relieve or develop symptoms.
Fake the results that the child is considered ill, e.g. glucose being given to a urine sample, to look like the child has diabetes.
The onset of symptoms of the disease, e.g. giving children the necessary medicines and other substances.
How often does the Münchhausen team take place?
It is difficult to estimate how often this disorder occurs, as many cases of the disease are not reported.
The study published in 2000 showed that 89 cases of this disorder occurred in more than two years.
What should be done if a child is suspected to be in danger?
Contact the local special services department or call the NSPCC child protection infoline with the number 0808 800 5000.
Nigeria: Police raid to school in Kadunia, evacuation 300 children
Kaduna – Kaduna State Police Station in Kadun conducted a raid yesterday at Imam Ahmad Bn Hambal School, located in Layin Maidubun Tsumma, Riga, Igabi's government district, arrested seven teachers and evacuated about 300 children.
The police said that the children were in a highly dehumanizing condition, and the school authorities objected to this claim.
“ They don’t tell the truth, ” said a Witness in school, “because all the children were there in agreement with their parents.
Before they took children to school, the parents signed the form.
Parents brought their children daily food and knew what conditions they were in.
We were extremely surprised by the arrival of the police and the evacuation of the children, as well as the removal of the whole food of the students provided by the parents before the school was closed.
That's not right, because parents can tell if their children are in bad shape, as the police say.
He added that previous Commissioner of Police Abdurrahman, who once visited school to check the level of child care, never had any reservations.
He claimed that the children were studying the Koran and nothing else.
However, an expert at the Post Office of the Public Relations Police, Yakubu Sabo, believed that after the government had passed on the status of children, they would join their parents.
‘They shall be kept under dehumanising conditions in the name of submission or acquisition of Korean knowledge.
Many of them had twins on their backs, which proves they're bito.
That's why we're studying school to get to know her owner," he added.
Foreign talent important for China's development
Guangdong is the leader in the country in terms of attracting foreign talents largely because of the Pasa and Szaku Initiative (BRI), the Great Gulf Area (GBA) Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao and the new role of Shenzhen as a pilot demonstration area.

Born from Singapore Yash, born in 2010, during the Asian Games in Guangzhou, he said he would like to realize his dream of becoming a scientist and making a doctorate in Guangzhou.
Nikita Nikandrow, a Russian-Chinese student at Shenzhen MSU-BIT, said: "Thanks to the initiative, Russian students can study with Chinese students.
We can create new concepts and new ventures together.
Rachel Rommeswinkel from the United States began her career as a blogger on the subject of hate in Dongguan and has more than a million fans at Bilbili and Weibo.
She said she would continue to share information about Chinese traditions, culture and technology in her films.
Leticia de Lassus of France, head of JJB International Montessori AMI Centre in Guangzhou, agrees that “the education of children is like a cutting-edge.
If you turn the first button off wrong, the rest of you will never get to your right place.
The American of Chinese origin Henry Xiao believes that in the very centre of the GBA area, his company can enjoy many privileges with regard to new principles, government policies and capital resources, and in particular talents.
The cook of the "Nanta Show" program Sean Choi from South Korea said that Guangdong's cuisine was known worldwide and the introduction of the "Nanta Show" program in Guangdong was a good decision.
Stephan Mohler, from Switzerland, who works at the post of Technical Director of Quality at Pearl River Pianos, believes that the secret of high quality is based on the proper performance of simple work.
To his surprise, many talented young people in China like to work, learn to make good products, and strive persistently for better results.
Survey: The Poles Want Banasis
Most Poles want the smoke of the Chief of the Supreme Chamber of Control Marian Banasi – the result of the Cantar survey for TVN.
On the question "Should you think the chief of NIK Marian Banas should give up smoking", 55% replied "yes" – including 34% marked the option "yes" and 21% "yes".

Following disclosure of the material, Banas ordered that a free leave be granted on 27 September until the expiry of the verification of its claims by the CBA.
The telephone survey Kantar was conducted on 25-26 September 2019 on a total Polish representative sample of 1005 people over 18 years of age.

Seimonika: Tusk or Kidawa-Blonski will be president
"I believe that Donald Tusk and Malgorzat Kidawa-Blonski have the chance to win the election with President Andrej Dud," says Thomas Seimonik.
Vice-Chairman Tomasz Seimonik spoke at Polsat News about the affair with chief NIK.
“This case is discriminating for Marian Banasi.
He may be the minister of culture from some entertainment, not the chief of the NIK or the minister of finance.
No one who's responsible for billions, for taxes," he said.
"This is a very serious state crisis," he added.
Seimonak also spoke of the candidate Claudia Jachiry.
‘Antoni Macierewicz is on the PiS list.
A man who wasn't just saying things, he was just doing them.
He has appointed former SKW leaders to spy on Russia, destroy their lives, destroy their families.
Why doesn't anyone appeal that Antonie Macerewicz is not on the list?" he asked.
“People of us young people have different aesthetics.
I think Jachira, who has already apologized for one of these things, also feels that sometimes she's overreacting.
Let's not do this campaigning problem," he added.

"Adolescent" masked child rapist from Central Coast forced to look at his victim in court
Dressed in a masquerade, a man caught a 12-year-old from the back of school and dragged her into dense growth in Central Coast in May 2017.
Then he tied her to the tree and raped her.
Soon after the arrest, a search warrant was carried out in his home, where officers detained a number of important items for the investigation.
The man was found guilty of seven charges relating to the attack and three other charges relating to the presence and use of another girl, aged 11 years, between August 2016 and August 2017.
The 12-year-old victim walked by the road, and when she looked behind her, she saw that she had suddenly left her arms armed with a large fork and a knife.
When she prayed "stop, stop, stop," she grabbed her neck and forced her into adulthood.
The man said: “Don’t cry.
Don't yell, because I'm gonna have to hurt you."
Holding a knife in his right hand, he tied his hands and legs with cables, and then he tied it to a tree and raped it for almost an hour.
When he cut it off, the girl ran to school with a hysterical scream.
The man got to work around 9.30 without answering a few text messages and connections from his colleagues.
His clothes were dirty and had traces of grass and wood, and he himself claimed to have been involved in a road rage attack, where he chased another driver in the bushes and fell off the cliff.
The next man's case will take place on Tuesday.
The Pope calls on the executive directors of technology companies to use artificial intelligence for common good
On Friday, Franciszek warned executive directors of technology companies, diplomats and financiers that, with the pursuit of artificial intelligence and other forms of digital achievement, there is a risk of increasing social inequalities, unless the common good is taken into account in its ethical approach.
Pope Francisk delivered those words at the Vatican conference, where government envoys and representatives of Facebook and Google, as well as philosophers, physicists and ethics, participated.
A small group of scholars and bishops of the Catholic Church gathered participants at the conference "The Common Good in the Digital Age".
This one-day event is the latest evidence that the Vatican is interested in the debate on the prospects and dangers of artificial intelligence.
They discussed the technological achievements in war art and the future of work, which will play an increasingly important role in the machine industry, and discussed the case of a study investigating the murder in Christchurch in New Zealand and the decisions taken by companies owned by the social media in connection with the expansion of the film recording the massacre.
During his talk at the Pope's conference, Franciszek praised the potential for technological progress, noting that the machinery at the beginning of the industrial revolution saved workers from dangerous and monotonous work.
He warned, however, that increasing dependence on robotics in order to achieve profits is the risk of losing people’s dignity as a result of work.
"If technological progress would become the cause of increasingly visible inequalities, it would not be real and real progress," he warned.
If so-called technological progress of humanity were to become an enemy of the common good, it would lead to an unwanted insomnia of some kind of barbarity under the most powerful law.
The conference organisers hoped to use the expertise of experts and identify potential future advisers of the Catholic Church in high-tech matters.

Is this the punishment of God?
What does the Church say about suffering?
Cataclysm, serious illness, child's death.
It's dramas that cause a lot of suffering and it's hard to understand.
We're asking, "Why?"
Sometimes we also hear that "God did so."
Is this the Creator sending us misfortunes and diseases?

When Nick Vujicic was born 36 years ago, his father was terrified to escape the hall.
"My son has no arm or leg!" he cried to the doctor.
The parents didn't know that their child was suffering from an incurable disease that left them without a limb.
At first, they couldn't accept the boy.
But they prayed, and after four months, Nick's mother felt that God had a plan for their child.
She decided to love her son with all her heart.
Today, Vujicic is a world-famous evangelizer and a motivational speaker, making many people turn around.

We're looking for a reason.
We ask, "Why did this happen to us?"
If we believe that God rules the whole world and directs our lives, the question naturally arises whether he has sent us sickness, misfortune...".

The crimes you've committed, they're talking about themselves.
The murder of two children.
Trying to kill four kids and all of them to get rid of them.
I am practically convinced that each of you will be sentenced to several life imprisonments at the appropriate time."
This court will decide whether it will be a penalty for an indiscriminate release without the possibility of conditional release.
The verdict will fall on November 12.
Poseł PO Krzysztof Brejza is a guest of Caesar Gmyz
"As a result of the campaign of written lies, I am making a call to Caesar Gmyz," said Krzysztof Brejz on Twitter.
The reason for the call is a statement by publicist Cesar Gmyz on the TVP screen.
One of the leading leaders of SokomzBuraka is Krzysztof Breiz, who has a lot of experience in the hate department.
“People who are perfectly familiar with Marius Kozaka-Zagozda – the founder of the “heterski” profile – are Kyerwiński, Budka and Guertych,” Gmyz said.
SokzBuraka are social pages and profiles with members and jokes related to politics.
As the Networks say, the profile of this title is based on Mariusz Kozak-Zagozda.
"We have been able to find out that since April, Mr. Mariusz Kozak-Zagozda has been employed in the Warsaw City Office, in the marketing office," he wrote a week.

Boris Johnson addressed to the police authority in connection with the close relationship with businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
The IOPC's independent police authority shall examine the possibility of initiating an investigation to explain whether, during the administration of the public authority as Mayor of London, it was allowed to commit a criminal offence.
The Council of Great London (GLA) stated in a statement that its supervisory inspector registered the Prime Minister's "procedure issue" in connection with the charges of preferential treatment of Arcuri arising from their close acquaintance.
"The matter related to the proceedings can be referred to when information indicating the possibility of committing a crime appears," he said.
That doesn't mean it's proven in a way.
IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to examine this matter.
The issue was addressed to the IOPC, which deals with complaints against members of police services in England and Wales.
She was transferred to the police department because Johnson was then acting as the appropriate police commissioner and criminal commissioner.
Johnson objected to his close relationship with Arcuri as if it had caused any irregularities.
He said earlier that he would apply to the London City Council's order and provide details on his relationship with Arcuri, but he relied on the Council's being "accompanied by the wrong problem".
The order is followed by the report "The Sunday Times", that Arcuri, an American who moved to London seven years ago, received 126,000 pounds of budgetary money, and privileged access to three foreign trade missions, which were then the head of Mayor Johnson.
As a result of this report, the government has frozen a grant of £100,000 for the Hacker House company of Arcuri.
The government is waiting for difficult questions on the verification procedure carried out before the grant of the funds.
Mr. Matt Warman said in the Gmin Chamber that his department's employees "usually maintained proper care" and that the company had a British phone number.
According to numerous reports, however, connections with the number were transferred to the office in California, where the 34-year-old Arcuri is now to live.
The close relationship of the Prime Minister with businesswoman "was a secret police staff."
The GLA's decision to refer the matter to the independent IOPC police department met with dissatisfaction at 10 Downing Street.
According to the source of the higher rank of government representative, it is "a politically motivated attack", and its term, prior to the Conference of the Conservative Party, is "publicly political".
"The supervisory inspector did not present any evidence confirming the charges and the prime minister did not receive the opportunity to respond before the press release late Friday evening," said the source.
Neither citizens nor the media will be able to rely on such a clear political statute.
Today, in the early hours of the “The Standard” journals said that the close relationship between Johnson and the businesswoman from California, who was assisted by the London Tourism and Promotion Agency, was for employees as “the secret police”.
London & Partners (L&P) said that Arcuri was given a place during Johnson's foreign trade trips as mayor, despite the fact that her company was then not considered "trustworthy".
Third accused of drug offences in connection with Mac Miller's death
LOS ANGELES (AP) – As a result of the last year's death of rapper Mac Miller, a third man was arrested and charged with committing drug offences.
According to court documents, Stephen Walter is suspected of selling fake fentanyl-treated oxycodone pills that Miller had in his possession before his death in September last year as a result of accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, that is, a strong opioid responsible for “epidemia”, which buried several thousand human beings in the United States.
Walter accuses himself of supplying pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.
The court documents sealed Tuesday reveal that Petttit received drugs from Walter all August.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havasu City in Arizona, is suspected of playing the "curier" role of Walter, who delivered the pills to Petito.
Neither man was directly accused of causing Miller's death, nor did any of them present defense lines in his case.
Walter, who was subject to a 2005 drug waiver, was arrested and was further sentenced to five months' imprisonment for violating the conditions of release.
Prosecutors who are dealing with the case, which they first brought on Thursday's website dedicated to the TMZ Celebrates, demand that Walter remain in custody awaiting trial, claiming that there is a serious risk of the accused's escape.
The reply to the message left on the automatic secretary of his lawyer did not come immediately.
Pettito was put on trial at the Federal Court on 4 September, and his defendant refused to comment.
The word of the rhymed songs Miller is a sincere talk about his depression and the use of drugs, so he won fans among the biggest hip-hop stars.
Coming from Pittsburgh Miller, who was really called Malcolm James Myers McCormick, for two years he was left behind in connection with the songmaker Ariana Grande finished earlier in 2018.
After his death in the Instagram portal, she published an exciting film with the participation of Miller and the creation of "Thank U Next", in which she mentions him with love.
Miller is one of the musicians whose death has been linked to the abuse of opioids in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, a guitarist from 3 Doors Down team, also died as a result of overdose in 2016, and his body identified the presence of fentanyl and hydrocodone.
This Article has been amended: the correct writing by Walter is "Stephen", not "Steven".
9-year-old Nigerian creates more than 30 games on mobile devices
9-year-old creates a game of fun in the hidden with free Scratch 2 programming application.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations and stories in online or offline mode.
So far, Basil has generated more than 30 games on mobile devices.
Today there is a battalion in the game, which is hidden under the programme.
The player gets a point every time he grabs a bat who gets out of the hideout.
I've learned to make games in a fast-paced course.
"Now I make them when I'm bored," Basil CNN said.
In March, Dad wrote it on a five-day accelerated course for children between the ages of 5 and 15.
The course, organized by Codefest International, aimed at providing children such as Basil, access to new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
The boy's father, Basil Okpara senior, claims Basil played a lot of games on mobile devices.
“When he was 4 years old, I bought him a tablet because he always picked up the phone and played on it.
He played a lot in Candy Crush and Temple Run," said CNN father.
But Basil's interest in the creation of games grew when he was 7 years old and received a scholarship to spend all the time on the game.
"One day he played on the table as usual, and he was so hungry that I was upset," said his father.
In anger I said, "You're still just playing, can't you think about creating your own games so they can play it for others?"
Speaking those words, I was upset and didn't think he'd take them seriously," he added.
Since then Basil has shown an active interest in the science of creating his own games, has attracted parents to the purchase of a laptop and has written it on a course where he knew the basis of the creation of games.
Basil, who in the future wants to be a scientist, gives his own thunder a title based on their contents.
One of his games, "Mosquito mash", is available on Google play store.
Africa has the largest population of young people in the world and, like Basil, this population includes leadership in innovation on the continent.
Two Nigerian 12-year-olds have recently been praised for using codes to create robots that distribute their work at home.
In May, the Acrobot team from the middle of the female school in Ghana won the Robofest 2019 competition for the programming of boxes.
And thanks to the growing investment of giants in the field of technology, such as Google and Microsoft, in Africa, Basil and its distributors are on their way to a career of coding stars.
Former President of the Republican Party in the North Carolina Admits a Lie on Corruption
It follows from the submissions made on Friday in court that the president of the Republican Party in the North Kingdom has given in court that he has lied to federal agents investigating the corruption of the main political donor.
According to the novel Robin Hayes, he's going to admit himself to guilt on the next Wednesday.
From a document containing a factual basis prepared under the defense agreement and signed by Lawyer Hayes, Hayes knew that he was making a false statement to FBI agents investigating corruption in 2018.
The defense agreement has been awarded, and there is no real basis for the allegations Hayes has made.
Initially, he was accused of verbal abuse, corruption, and false testimony.
The prosecutors accused former Congressman Hayes of participating in the plan of the insurance company's authorities, which is in charge of the campaign, to the head of the insurance market regulator in exchange for special treatment.
Director Greg Lindberg and his two associates were accused of trying to bribe the State Commissioner for Insurance Mike Causey.
Lindberg is the founder of the insurance and investment company, which has been one of the main political donors in recent years, who has been handing over over over $5 million to national and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He mainly supported the goals and policies of the Republican Party, but he also thanked the Democrats.
His lawyer did not respond to Friday's e-mail request.
Defender Hayes Kearns Davis did not respond to Friday's e-mail request.
From the submissions made on Friday of the court documents, Hayes lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he did not talk to Causey about employees of the State Insurance Department.
According to a document containing Hayes' factual basis, he actually spoke to the insurance commissioner about the request of Lindberg for changes in staff employed by the market regulator.
The prosecutors claim that Hayes also helped Lindberg organize a meeting with Causey and that he talked about the trap directly with the regulator.
According to the April indictment, Lindberg required special treatment of his insurance activities and planned to transfer up to $2 million to the new Causey campaign in 2020.
The indictment also shows that the contract also contains a request for a change in the official of the department who controlled Lindberg.
As a Republican Causey, he announced a alleged attempt to corrupt federal agents and helped them to collect evidence on the matter.
He wasn't charged with any charges.
According to Lindberg's indictment, Hayes ordered him to transfer $250,000 to Causey's campaign, during which Lindberg and Causey were also present.
During the Hayes conversion, he initially protested, claiming that the transfer of such a sum of money would draw attention, but, as the prosecution has shown, he finally stopped.
"Whatever you all want to do, we will do it," Hayes said, according to the indictment.
"Okay, I'll take care of it."
The Federal Prosecutor's Office did not respond to the e-mail request for further information on the agreement.
The conductors will go with the first piece of a new tomb
The drivers from Saturday will be able to use the first of the three constructed mountain sections of the S7 expressway, the new Zakopanski – from the Skomielne White to Rabka Source and further the two-day main road accelerated to Chabówka.
As told in Friday by the spokesperson of the Krakow Department of National Roads and motorways (GDDKiA) Ivan Mikrut, this is the first of three sections of the S7 built south from Krakow, from Lubnia to Rabki Source, which will be given for use.
From more than six kilometres from the White-to-Chabowka Squad, that is, about one third.
2.3 km, she was driven on the highways.
Seventeen were built, including the longest and highest, counting miles of length and 50 m of height, and four small objects in the creeks at the Scomielna train.
From this link were taken to Wadowice and New Judgment, to national road No. 28 and to the old DK7.
From the next link, Zabornia, you can go to DK47 in the direction of the New Market and buried and on DK7 to the East and the border of Slovakia.
In the Zbijjeky Mountains there was a place for travel services of the MOPs.
The expressway ends with the Zabornia link in Rabce Source, to which was built about a mile of a two-day fragment DK47 in Chabówka and is included in the already existing two-day Chabówka – Rdzawka.
The section S7 Skomielna Biała – Radka Srój and the new section of National Road No. 47 of the accelerated main class (GP) from Rabki Source to Chabówki was built by the Italian company Salini Impregilo from Milan.
The cost of the investment amounted to about 615 million dollars.
The quality assurance of the work will be valid for 10 years.
Counting approximately 16.7 km of the new fragments of the Zakopianki, including 15.8 km of expressway parameters, was divided into three implementing sections, each with its own contractor: Lubijn – Repair, Repair – Skomielna Biała and Skomielna Biała – Rabka Zrój.
The first section to enter the tunnel is carried out by Poland – the Ukrainian consortium of companies: IDS-BUD S.A. from Warsaw and the ALTIS-HOLDING Corporation from Kiev, the tunnel section – the Italian company Astaldi, and the third – the Italian company Salini.
The total cost of these tasks is close to 2.5 billion dollars.
The investment is co-financed by the European Union Funds under the Operational Infrastructure and Environment Programme 2014-2020.
The amount of funding is over 1.3 billion dollars.
The entire section consists of 38 engineering facilities (bridges, wiads, stacks) and a two-room tunnel of 2,06 km long.
According to the plan, the road manager will still be available this year, 7.6 km from Lubien – Repair with temporary integration into the old DK7, which drivers will limit the construction of the tunnel.
The last section, Repair – Skomielna White with a length of about 3 km, drivers will leave in 2021, after completion of the two-room tunnel with a length of about 2,06 km.
Our goal is a state of well-being
"We are building a welfare state in Poland," Zbigniew Ziobro, Minister of Justice, ordered.
He came to Szczecin to call for a vote on the councillor Darius Matecki, who is running for Sejm from the law and justice list.
"The good change programme is the implementation of the Polish welfare strategy," the Minister said.
"We want the Poles to make a lot better for their lives to be at a higher level.
This is necessary, because otherwise young, dynamic, well-educated people will leave Poland, and we cannot afford it.
Our government has consistently carried out a programme that was committed to carry out four years ago.
We said we'd put in the 500 plus program.
Platform, Donald Tusk and Eva Kompcz said it's impossible that there's just no money.
We proved that the money was and was, but the PO didn't care about the people they were dealing with."
Ziobro also reminded of the children's manufacturing and the thirteenth retirement – and that the fourteenth retirement is also planned.
In addition to the "distorting division of national income", PiS priorities are a just state and economic development.
The money should not only be a large stream to the selected pockets that have a good relationship with the establishment and authority, but should be equally accessible to the whole of society – the policy has been established.
Emmanuel Macron sells Jacques Chirac's fortune
French President Emmanuel Macron congratulated him on Thursday on the television presentation of his predecessor Jacques Chirac; he called him a great Frenchman and a great man of state.
At 21 o'clock in the gold for the former president, the Eiffel Tower lights went out.
The former president and Prime Minister of France Jacques Chirac died on Thursday morning at 86.
Macron's welcome speech broadcasts all of France's most important television channels.
"He was the husband of the state we loved, just as he loved us," said the president.
“For more than 40 years in politics, Chirac’s face was close to us.
And whether we split his ideals, his battles, or not, we all recognized each other in this man.
This evening is a night of gratitude for Jacques Chirac.
He did so much for the nation, for our values, brotherhood and tolerance," Macron continued.
He reminded Chirac that in 2003 he opposed war with Iraq, which had no mandate from the UN, to pursue peace in the Balkans, stability and peace in Lebanon.
Before the television show, Macron went to the Paris Chirac apartment on the de Tournon Street.
In the south, the National Assembly honored the ex-President's departure with a minute's silence.
The Elisha Palace will be open from 21 a.m. on Thursday to Sunday evening for all those who wish to join the Condolence Book.

The annual funeral of Jacques Chirac will take place next week; the exact time and details are not yet known.
Part of Sopock Street in Nisko after construction
On Tuesday, 24 September, the Sopock Street in Nisko was officially launched.
The total value of the task amounted to 803 thousand gold, of which a million 26,000 gold was funding from the FDS, while the remaining amount was its own contribution from the Dutch People's Republic and the Gminy and the City of Nisko.
Thanks to the measures obtained, the area of 1284 metres has been completed, along with its extension, a path of 950 metres, drainage and finishing work.
The investment operator was the consortium of companies: PBI Infrastructure S.A. Z Krasník and PBI WMB Sp. z o.o. z Sandomijer.

Facebook with a feeling of self-esteem is hiding for a sample of favorites
As part of the first experience in the world, which aims to improve user self-esteem, some of Facebook users will soon see no number of favorites, reactions and video displays.
Favorites will be hidden and visible only to the author of the post, and this change will be introduced in Australia following a similar test carried out on Instagram in July.
The new version of Facebook launched next Friday will also be launched in Australia.
Mia Garlick, director of Facebook's privacy in Australia, said that the change was the result of a study on self-esteem and opinions of psychologists in the field of mental health indicating that the number of favorites can be compared to others.
"The clothes from the many groups working with us on the fight against malnutrition, as well as organisations in the field of mental health, were really positive," said Garlick.
The elimination of this counter will make people focus on the quality of their interactions and on the quality of their content, not on the number of favorites or reactions.
It is expected that sharing with others through the platform will be more enjoyable and will not be taken as a rival – she said.
Garlick has ensured that companies that support Facebook activities will still receive the same indicators and observations that they have had access to so far.
She stated that it was too early to be able to determine whether the test would be extended to other countries, as was the case with Instagram when the test was carried out in Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
As with Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there is no indication of when the experiment will end and whether the change will be introduced permanently.
"The user's initial comments on the new rules in the Instagram were positive, but at this stage we are still learning and listening to the opinion," she said.
Commenting on the location of the world experiment, Garlick said that Australia has very active, technically recognised Facebook and Instagram users.
We believe that it is an incredible country that provides us with measurable opinions indicating whether new experience is valuable for people using our services or not.
Common: Counsellors want compensation for pilgrims
Often, which does not yet comment on the Council's appeal to abpa Wacława Depo for financial compensation for the maintenance of the waste economy during the pilgrimage season.
The city demands 1 zł from pilgrims.
On Friday, he spoke of a speech addressed to the Metropolis at a press conference, including the leader of the Spring Robert Biedronia, organized on the leading side of the Spring Summit of the Most Holy Mary Miss, vice president of the city council and candidate for Sejm Lukasz Kot.
As he said, the SLD councillors voted a call to Abpa Wacław Depo on the day before, to transfer the city of one gold from each visiting frequent pilgrimage – to support the work of urban, municipal, etc.
We accepted an appeal to Archbishop Depo to help the city, helped us clean up the pilgrims, get the town for the pilgrims.
‘Please refer to the budget of the symbolic city of gold from each pilgrimage.
This city will provide them with better living conditions in Chęstochowi," the Vice-President of the City Council said.
Asked for a comment by a frequent speaker, Mr. Mariusz Bakalarz, who initially prepared a few questions, he then asked, as he pointed out, at the order of abp. Depo, to replace it with the information on the content: “Until we have received the official position of the City Council, we do not refer to the matter”.
According to a project put on the site of the frequently called ‘Depo’, "the provision of financial compensation for the city of Frestoch for the support of the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season".
"In view of the increasing number of pilgrims arriving in the Common Pilgrims and thus increasing the costs of the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season, bearing in mind the images of the city's inhabitants and residents, birds and birds, we would like to offer participation in the costs of the waste system, as part of the generally accepted canons of care for our common well-being, the small family of the Commons, to be participation in the costs of the waste system," the petition said.
"In order to maintain the purity of pedestrian tracks, which are moving pilgrimages, while using small infrastructure, i.e. external waste, we present a proposal for symbolic participation in the municipal waste management system in the amount of 1 zł from pilgrims," it said.
"In addition to the participation in annual costs that the city will cover from its own resources, taking into account the purity and aesthetics of the urban area, and in order to emphasize that such cooperation will benefit all parties, we declare that 20% of the amounts will be allocated to improve tourist infrastructure, for example by increasing the number of publicly available public toilets," the Council said.
They noted that, in addition to the financial issues, their proposal is based on the numerous reservations made by the residents regarding the state of the road purity which move pilgrimages.
"With regard to the purity of our city and the possible positive effects of cooperation, the Council of Common Cities calls on the Archbishop of the Wacław Depo of the Frequent Metropolis to send financial compensation to the Frequent City for the support of the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season," was reiterated in the appeal.
According to the press office of Jasna Gora, 834 thousand people attended the sanctuary in 200 general Polish pilgrimages throughout the year.
About 124 thousand faithful ones arrived in 255 pilgrimages.
More than 8.8 thousand people arrived in frequent bicycle pilgrimages (133 groups) and 440 people (16 groups) in running pilgrimages.
The disabled 20 people reached the sanctuary of the horse, and more than 170 pilgrims from two groups – on the rolls.
"Knowledge" TVP mentioned the Federation when describing the survey
According to a poll conducted by Pollster, in the elections to the PiS Sejm, 45% of the votes, 26%, 14%, 14%, 7% of the PSL, and 5% of the Confederation.
The election threshold was even written on the Super Express portal, for which the survey was conducted.
The main edition of "Knowledge", describing the same survey, presented only the results of the first four parties, completely ignoring the Confederation.
The leader, Edith Lewandowski, made it clear that only four committees had exceeded the electoral threshold and entered the Sejm.
The VAT also showed the division of seed mandates without taking into account the votes given to the Confederation.
It would give PiS self-government.
In commenting on this whole situation, Christoph Bosak spoke of "public compromise on honesty towards society".
"They started with a "moral revolution" puzzle," he recalled and said that this matter was a sign of weakness.
In turn, Robert Winnicki wrote on Twitter that "The knowledge of the TVP" in further actions against the Confederation is insulting Urban and Michnik".
He also drew attention to the lack of legal responses of journalists.
"But let us also look at those who allow silence.
These 'rights', 'independent', 'unsubordinate'.
In a few years they became a more primitive version of all that they fought at night," he added.
Malgorzata Motylow Vice President NIK
On Thursday 26 September, the Marcher of Sejm Elżbieta Witek gave Malgorzate Motylow an act of invitation to the post of Vice-President of the Supreme Chamber of Control on 27 September 2019.
"In accordance with Article 21(1) of the Supreme Court of the NIK Vice-Presidents Control Act, the Marshall Sejm shall, after having received the opinion of the relevant seed committee, appoint and revoke the NIK President," the Communication said.
The application in this case had an effect on Marseille Sejma on 24 September 2019.
"In accordance with the Sejm Regulation, it was addressed to the Commission on State Control, which welcomed it on 26 September," the Communication recalls.
"Also on 26 September 2019 the Vice-Presidents of the NIK were revoked: Eva Polkowski, Wojciech Kutila and Mieczysław Lúczak," the communiqué said.
Earlier that day, the proposal for all these personal decisions was welcomed by the State Control Commission's summit, since the vote on the opinion to appeal by Ewa Polkowska had been taken twice – in the first vote on the Commission, the same number of votes were against and against.
The new Vice President of NIK Malgorzat Motylow comes from Chelm Lubelski.
Brother sentenced to life penalty for the honourary murder of the social media stars Qandeel Baloch
Qandeel Baloch, who became the star through a photo published in social services, was released in July 2016.
The Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch was convicted of her murder on Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment for the most loudest "honor killing" in this patriarchal country.
Baloch, who gained fame by publishing bold selfies – the Greek according to Western standards, but in a highly misogynistic Pakistan considered to be provocative – was exasperated in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested.
A few days later, he said during a press conference that he had no conviction about his actions and stated that "of course" he had murdered his sister and that her behaviour was "an unacceptable".
His lawyer Sardar Mehmood told AFP that the court in West Multan considered his client guilty and sentenced him to life in a long-awaited sentence.
"Inshallah (if God permits), will be executed by the higher court," he said.
Earlier, Baloch's mother, Anwar Mai, announced to the AFP that she hoped her son would be executed.
“He is innocent.
It was my daughter, and it was my son" – she said.
The murder of Baloch has hit the heads of world information services and renewed calls for action against the so-called honour killings, in which victims, usually women, are killed for breaking patriarchal social principles.
Women were burned, thirsty, shot or stylized for crimes such as the choice of their own husband or, as in the case of Baloch, for bringing their family 's shame' through a manifestation of their own sexuality.
Kills are usually committed by a close-blooded person.
According to Pakistani law, Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (repealed) can ask for the nearest victims to be forgiven.
Three months after Baloch's murder, Parliament adopted a new legislation imposing a life imprisonment for honorary killings.
However, whether the murder will be considered an honorary crime remains in the presence of the judge, which means that the murderers may theoretically resort to another motive and be imprisoned.
In the case of Baloch, her parents at first insisted that their son be shown no favor at all.
However, the bereaved feel that they too can lose, change their mind, and declare that they want to get rid of him.
The international outrage caused by the murder has led the Pakistani state to take an unprecedented step and to announce that they have fallen along with their parents, thus forcing the case to move forward.
One of Baloch's most well-known works is to offer a stripper to the Pakistani cricket team and to wear a decolonized purple dress in Valentine's Day.
It was criticised and threatened, but many, including young people, viewed it as a violation of the country in which the position of Kim Kardashian's model can be considered a bold and political movement to strengthen the position of women.
The roots of "honor killings" are in the tribal social standards that still dominate South Asia, and in particular the behaviour of women, although men can also be victims.

Anarchia doubles the number of displaced persons from north-west Nigeria to 40,000: UNHCR
On Friday, the United Nations organization reported that increasing violence has resulted in the duplication of the number of persons displaced from north-west Nigeria to about 40,000 people in the last four months.
The United Nations Relief Agency has found that concerns have created "a new exceptional humanitarian situation", which requires an inter-agency effort to raise new funds by the end of the year to $35 million.
Babar Baloch, spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said that the Islamic group of Boko Haram, which has been operating in the north of the country for decades, is not responsible for the recent attacks.
The increase in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfar and Katsina observed over the past 10 months is rather the result of organised armed groups.
"It paints a frightening image of anarchy and uncertainty," he told reporters on Friday.
He reported on frequent reports of kidnappings, tortures, forced executions, murders and sexual assaults by attackers, who also destroyed homes and stolen property.
The military and police were sent to fight gangs of criminals in the region.
However, the army is withdrawn from the fight with Boko Haram and from the Islamic state in West Africa, which separated itself from its former group in 2016.
"The refugees do not come with the names of the groups," he said.
They're coming for it with stories of monsters.
Most of the refugees reach the neighboring Niger.
In his statement to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, he said he hoped that more people would flock to Niger in the coming months, together with the deteriorating security situation, in particular in the state of Sokoto.
A new date has been set for the trial of the male accused of killing women and 2 children
A new date has been planned for the case for a man from Guatemala accused of killing the state of Iowa and her two children.
According to the Polish District Court, 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellan is accused of three murders of the first stage, according to the authorities, with a false name that he originally gave to the police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He didn't admit it.
According to the police, he shot 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter, and her 5-year-old son at their home in Des Moines on 16 July.
The Court finds that the new date of the hearing, i.e. on 27 January, gives representatives of both sides more time to prepare.
The officials of Immigration and Customs Services in the United States claim that Escobar-Orellana is illegally staying in the United States and was deported twice before the shooting.
In 2010, he was sentenced to illegal entry into the United States.
‘The Sun’: Boris Johnson in the face of a cabinet bomb that wants to reduce demand for brexit and reach a compromise agreement with Brussels
In just three weeks before the final summit of EU leaders among the most important people in the state around the Prime Minister, there is a growing fear that he will not have enough time to gain more important concessions.
Boris Johnson is facing the risk of a bomb from the office that wants to reduce the demands for a break and reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
In the negotiations, there was an impasse on the new customs system, which would replace the backstop mechanism for Ireland, because Brussels has defined the proposals for other provisions offered by Johnson as "inexhaustible".
Ministers of the Crown expect EU decision-makers, headed by German chief Angela Merkel, to offer them a three-year-old compromise on the backstop mechanism in the last moment.
Journalists "The Sun" spoke with three different cabinet ministers, all of whom are preparing to confront the Prime Minister after the annual tourist conference next week in Manchester.
They will demand the Prime Minister of the 'aggressive' strategy developed by his close adviser Dominic Cummings, who is trying to use bluff against the EU and threaten to leave the Union without an agreement and then accept the offers he has made recently by the Union.
One of the cabinet ministers identified the jury's verdict of the Supreme Court on Tuesday on the termination of parliament's suspension as a "warning signal" and added: "The only way to leave the European Union on 31 October is to do so on the basis of the agreement.
We never fight arithmetic in the Gmin Chamber, which works for our benefit.
The Prime Minister must now swallow and accept what he is able to get.
Aggressiveness doesn't pay: it's obvious that the Cummings plan burned down.
We can't fight on so many fronts.
The other cabinet minister committed himself to hand over to Johnson to try to break the deal with former Prime Minister Theresa May, unless everything else is said.
This minister said: "If I have to, I will tell the Prime Minister to re-present the agreement proposed by Theresa May in the Gmin Chamber."
There are many opportunities for her to vote, and everything depends very much on the end of this subject.
If we're forced to extend the deadline, it's the end of Boris Johnson and the end of all of us.
John Major accused Boris Johnson of not taking negotiations seriously.
In a momentary speech, the first minister of the tourist community said: “The Prime Minister tells us that he wants an agreement with the European Union.
But we don't see him sitting in Brussels and working on it.
Instead, he has been working with the cattle in Scotland, checking the eggs in Wales and fighting with citizens on the main streets of the city – everything in the world’s eyes, as if he had already been campaigning for good."
The speaker of the current Prime Minister admitted yesterday that the agreement was still far away and added: "No one should have any wrongs: a very long way to ensure agreement."
However, the speaker also said that the Benna Act introducing a three-month delay in the absence of an agreement "actively weakens our negotiating position" in Brussels.
He said: "There is no doubt that this law makes it difficult for us to negotiate, but despite the fact that the prime minister, together with his colleagues, is still trying to make progress."
Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay is returning to Brussels today, where he will have more talks with Michel Barnier on the EU side.
They will discuss a book on how to operate the area for all of Ireland for food and living.
A dog with no nose and legs subjugates Instagram.
Perfectly imperfect
Kundelek was supposed to be asleep.
However, this has been prevented.
The bitch was transferred from Romania to Britain by Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
The photo of the dog was published on Facebook.
Kate Comfort fell in love with the animal since her first look.
"I had difficulty at first believing my husband to be adopted because we had three dogs already," she said.
The woman decided that she would take care of the baby until she was adopted by someone.
However, no one has yet reported.
"The fact that no one wanted her made me want to take care of her more and more.
She was sensitive and needed love," Kate said.
The marriage finally decided to adopt Bonnie.
"Our Bonnie is perfectly imperfect.
We love her the way she is, and if anyone doesn't like what she looks like, it's his problem, not ours," said the woman.
Bonnie became a social media star over time.
She's watching over 14,000 internet sites on Instagram.
Lorraine Kelly: It's said that with a glass accent I'll never make a career on TV
According to Lorraine Kelly, TV leaders said that because of the accent from Glasgow, "he will never make a career" as a presenter.
Referring to her 35-year-old career in Kelly's television industry, in 59, she admitted that before the first show on the screen, she felt "very nervous."
"I was only 25 years old and I was very upset," she said.
When I worked in BBC Scotland as a research and information expert, the chief of staff said that through my accent from Glasgow, I would never be successful on TV.
I went to London to meet the entire TV team and watch the show before I took up office duties in Glasgow.
I'll never forget the interview with the star Bette Davis conducted by Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I didn't believe I was in the same room with a live legend.
I knew I wanted to stay here.
Before Kelly became a shock TV correspondent in 1984, she began her career as a local newspaper reporter in East Kibride, Scotland.
She then started running programs such as GMTV, ITV Breakfast and Daybreak, later to start her early "Lorraine" program, which she named after.
The 35th anniversary of her career is a special program where she will mention her best memories of moments and interviews.
The representative said that the secret to her long internship on television is "passage and enthusiasm" and "interest", adding: "You have to work hard.
To be honest and authentic.
Prepare for programs and be both interesting and interesting.
When she mentioned the media reports that had disturbed her emotions, Kelly said that "very difficult" for her was the relationship of a murder in Dunblane.
I had no idea that many families of slain or wounded children were watching our program live from Dunblane the day after the terrible murder of sixteen children and their teachers.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, whose five-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked me to have a private meeting, during which we spoke for hours at her house.
The whole meeting was quiet, and Pam Ross and I have been friends since Joanna's funeral, where I took part.
She added that "very difficult" was an interview with Kate and Gerry McCannami shortly after their daughter Madeleine disappeared in 2007 and that "their strength and courage were really exhilarating".
They have to deal with pain because they don't know what happened to their beloved daughter, and they also have the most terrible comments from online trolls.
I'm with them with all my heart.
The 35th anniversary of Lorraine Kelly's work on TV will start at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, 30 September at the ITV station.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga was afraid of imprisonment
The senior state official claimed that Vice-President Constantino Chiweng rejected the offer to take over the president's office made by the non-living president Robert Mugabe at the top of the turnout because he was afraid of being imprisoned in order to confirm the take over of the military in November 2017.
As Mr Mugabe presented last week, he offered the Vice-President of Chiwanze the presidency during negotiations with the military in the process of conversion.
However, a higher level of government official announced in the community media that Chiwenga did not reject the proposals out of fear, but because he looked at the Mugabe plan, which established its use to prove to the world leaders and the African Union (AU) that it actually lost during the conversion.
In the Twitter portal, which confirmed that the 37-year-old leader of Zimbabwe wanted to hand over the power of Vice-President Chiwanza, not President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Jamwanda 2, to which officials confirmed to the state that he was a senior official of the Bureau of Presidents and Council of Ministers, it was claimed that there had been intensive negotiations on the matter at that time.
The officials told the state that Mugabe had contacted Chiweng through one of his envoys when he realized that his authority was getting out of hand.
The mediation between the military authorities and the former president had, in the opinion of a senior official, three stages.
The official claimed that among the participants in the negotiations, he was the spokesman for President George Charamba, who was then the head of the Central Intelligence Organization Aaron Nheper and the spiritual representative of the Roman Catholic Bishop Fidelis Mukonori.
The Bank's chief of Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, has been another element since Mugabe sent him with a one-person mission to hand over the offer of the presidency of Chiwanze, who was the head of the Zimbabwe Defence Force (SOZ).
A man who was considered to be an African icon more than ever after his death tried empty-handedly to deplete military action from the UA, trying to lure other African leaders into intervention.
The President's offer, made by the deceased (Mugabe) to the former Chief of Defence Forces (SSO) Chiwanza, was not made out of choice.
"It was a desperate act to save the situation, which took a dangerously fast pace, removing part of the deceased's family," the official wrote (Jamwanda).
But there was also some political temptation, for which the deceased wanted to reverse the situation in a completely non-deploymental way.
It is enough to remind ourselves that the commanders have declared that they have not failed and will not violate constitutional order, which would be the cause of their conflict with the UA position on conversions.
The dead (Mugaba) hoped that then the SSO (Chiwenga) would drown, violently interrupting the leaders' claims that they did not interfere with the constitutional order.
The hope for the dead (Mugabe) was that the UA, which, on the margin, was still highly distracted by the whole situation and the way it was adapted to its theoretical taxonomy of conversions, would then have no choice but to describe it as a conversion, so calling for military intervention would be credible.
It was in such a spirit and with such calculation that the offer was made.
Officials claimed that Mugabe had made this move when he realized that the defence forces were no longer ready to protect him.
They said that Mugabe was forced to sign a resignation note after the mob warned him that he was risking a Kaddafi-style lynx.
The military chief told him they wouldn't shoot the citizens if they moved on to his Blue Roof residence.
And at the same time, Mugabe had two wishes to save his family and prove that the army had taken over," the officer added.
The current SSO and the commanders have read the assumptions correctly.
To the consignor (Gono) who conveys this desperate message to understand, through a strong metaphor, that the tiri wemakwapa-makwapa (which belongs to the camouflage sect, i.e. the army), we are not politicians or we are not competing with each other at political level, has claimed a higher rank of state official.
Officials tell the state that the military has informed military commanders in the region through attacks in Zimbabwe that they are not going to cover Mugabe, but to deal with the "criminalists".
Mugabe tried to use the same strategy to try Mnangagwa again from a short drive back to South Africa so that they could talk about conversion and success.
In addition to negotiations with the army, Mugabe also sought assistance in the region.
The inhabitants of the South African Republic, which is a key element of the process – not only because of their economic and regional strength, but also because the former President Jacob Zuma was President of Sadc – rejected the intervention, but clearly indicated that if the army finds the Mugabe house, as it feared many times in the background, the forces of the South African Republic will immediately appear in Harare.
"It didn't work because Putin and African leaders did not choose this route," said the Independent, a certain informant.
China needs a strong leadership or it will be "distorted" as a political document states
China needs a strong, unified leadership of the Communist Party, because otherwise the country will "disappear" – the government stated in a document on the policy adopted on Friday in the early 70th anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic.
The Chinese government's press office reported in the White Paper that the country's success since the Communists took over 70 years ago led the party.
The Chinese occupy a large area, have complex national conditions, but there are rarely administrative difficulties here.
The document mentions that without the single and strong leadership of China, they will move towards divisions and divisions, which will be disastrous for the world.
The Chinese authorities have long used hard-handed policies to solve problems, as in the case of a wave of pro-democratic protests in Beijing in 1989, justifying the need to maintain the stability of the country.
President Xi Jinping, who is holding a strong hand, will be at the forefront of the second-year trade in the world economy on Tuesday, from the time of the adoption of the office by the end of 2012, has strengthened the party's governments and imposed sanctions on those who can question the authority.
Xi is also overseeing the military modernisation programme, which has run out of balance in this region.
The document states that China does not attempt to export its development model or want to import any foreign models, seeking only peace, not hegemony.
The Chinese do not have any control over the world in the genes of other nations.
In modern times China has been oppressed by great powers, and war and anxiety have left deep impression on them as a result of the suffering they have suffered; China will never cause the other sufferings they have experienced.
China covers this year in times of uncertainty for a country affected by a bitter trade war with the United States and facing challenges due to the emerging economy, as well as anti-government protests in China in Hong Kong.
The document says that China will never "negotiate" its main interests or allow anything to undermine their sovereignty.
As regards the country's trade dispute with Washington, the document stated that "the danger of trade wars and the further increase in customs tariffs do not solve problems".
China has matured the economy with a full industrial system, a complete industry chain, a large market place and a strong pace of economic development.
The document added that "war trades will never weaken it".
The Chinese are sure that they are able to face difficulties, the crisis to change into new opportunities and to open up a new world.
It was also added that the United States should rationally look at China's development, because China does not intend to question the position of the United States, nor does it want to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and even less likely to stop the development of China.
The limitation and weakening of other countries and the transfer of national disputes abroad will not provide the United States with a strong position.
World Jack Pålkiewicz: Dubai, real faces
Dubai's emigration is a place that still seeks its own identity, divided between the Bedouin tradition, religious radicalism of Islam and extremism of progressiveness.
This leading new trend of world tourism leads to the awakening of imagination and desires, leading to the emptyness of rich snobbish hotels and attracting the fortunes of investors and traders as a tax haven.
Websites are inspired by this city of dreams, which is an exciting temple of luxury and a concentrated 20th-century architecture.
They arose on the rich island of Emirat, which became Eden for those who love the rest, five star hotels, beautiful weather and pools hundreds of meters above the earth.
It is a great delight to see all around here, appreciate creative hyperactivity and historic achievement for avant-garde.
This is the city whose motto says everything: “Walk, shake and tear.”
And it's almost every step.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling it a city of no character.
According to the British writer Lawrence Osborne, "the full range and the contraryness of the metropolis took the size of the dental grotesque".
It turned into a futuristic nightmare, totally dominated by the Guinness Book of Records, an unofficial constitution of emirate.
Because everything here must be bigger and more beautiful than anywhere else in the world.
However, there is a lack of something that is perhaps a little transparent in old Europe, but important for the quality of life.
In Wrocław, Berlin or Madrid, everyone feels like they're at home.
And in Dubai, I'm sure not.
Running away from the magic world, I broke his golden mask, revealing the other faces of the artificial paradise.
It's an account that doesn't speak loud and that doesn't write.
I'm showing the Asian nuisance contrasting with the basic living conditions of the Dubajczyk ethnic caste, the unwritten Bedouin grandsons.
I live in extreme poverty, such as the ghetto on the edge of the city, where an army of Asian workers is under cruel conditions.
That is exactly what they built in one generation under slave conditions to reach the desert sky of Manhattan.
They came here with good wages and a chance to ensure a decent life for their families, and they were left with a nightmare.
The tourist will never see it because it could blow up in the air created by the years mit Dubai.
More and more the criticism of the international community makes the topic of cheap labour become highly difficult for the emire.
Mel C of the Spice Girls team banned discussions about diets in their home after their fights with eating disorders
Melanie Chisholm, from Spice Girls, admitted that there was a ban on diets in her home after she had struggled with eating disorders for years, eating only fruit and vegetables.
Sports Spice for years did not eat and "obsessively practiced" as a result of the pressure associated with being a famous member of the pop group all over the world, which later caused depression and eating disorders.
It is now revealing that her experiences affect her way of raising her daughter Scarlet, so she “does not allow her home to talk about diets. ”
"Scarlet is now 10 years old and I start to see that he is more aware of his appearance," Mel said.
"I think that one of the positive experiences of eating disorders is that I am very aware of how I speak to her.
The use of a positive language has now become my habit.
In an interview for the Women's Health Mel magazine, which gained fame in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls team, she said that in times before the creation of social media, the press "disturbing" comments on her topic brought out complexities.
"I began to look at myself in an inappropriate way, abandoning some groups of food products, practicing more and more obsessive until I began to have a weakness," he says.
"I was sick and it probably lasted a few years."
A picture that shook the world
The Polish girl and American documentaryist gave the world a witness about the cruelty of war.
The legendary photo by Julien Bryan can be viewed at the World War II Museum in Gdansk
"Listen to my story.
I'm talking from the troubled town of Warsaw.
I can and must speak on behalf of the Polish people about what happened here.
America must act, must help!", began his radio presentation documentaryist, photographer, Julien Bryan.
In September 1939 he was in the capital of Poland, watching the drama of the bombed city and its inhabitants.
His relationship took place in the West with a wide range of features.
The president of Warsaw, Stefan Starzyński, helped him first, borrowed his car, but then asked him to leave immediately for his own safety.
Bryan wrote a farewell note to the family in the United States, deposited it in the embassy safe and... stayed.
For the next four weeks, he was trying to be anywhere where the warts were.
400 planes and artillery almost stopped attacking the city.
Bryan lived on the pictures of death, suffering, the struggle to survive in the ruins of the city.
Just prior to the surrender, he and the embassies made a negative move towards the ocean.
He wasn't talking about Hitler's crimes.
He appealed to the world: “What Warsaw met, Paris, London, and even New York.”
His shocking chronicle was watched by President Eleanor Roosevelt.
Soon the United States began preparing for war.
“Dad showed the truth and thus fought German propaganda.
They made films that glorify their wealth.
They said they didn't attack women and children, and people believed them," says Sam Bryan, son of Julien.
Question before the jury against the former sportsman accused of numerous rapes
In front of the jury, the case of rape is the case of the former baseball team of the University of Delaware, who is accused of numerous sexual assaults.
On Friday, after 10 days of giving the testimony and hearing the arguments, the jury members agreed to the 23-year-old Clay Conawaya solution.
A woman who was 21 years old says Conaway raped her when she went to her home in June 2018.
The event took place three weeks after this two-story meeting on the Bumble site and sending a woman through the man of the photo on which he presented himself naked.
The woman is one of six Conaway accused of sexual assault in the years 2013-2018.
According to the prosecutor, the hug that the woman had agreed to had turned into a rape, which had been the result of her opposition.
The defenders refer to the opposite relationship between the woman and the port in memory and claim that the woman probably regretted that it had come to an intimate close.
Two-wheel gold: Polish bike for a million gold
A gold bike worth a million gold could be viewed on the anniversary, the 10th edition of the Biike-EXPO International Road Markets.
This is an extraordinary vehicle printed on a 3D printer.
His constructor, 30-year-old Adam Zdanowić just got Oskar's bike for him at the World Exhibition of Custom Rives in Las Vegas.
- The Rover is covered with a golden sodium chromium, under which is the highest silver sample.
It's an unusual cover made by my colleague from Zor.
“If you are a saddle, are pedals, is a driver, you could normally drive it.
It can expand speed 50 kilometers an hour.
It's an electric bike," says his designer.
‘The bike car was printed on a 3D printer.
It's six types of virus.
I came up with the idea of this model riding on my first bike home a few years ago.
I drew it on the card and hid it deep into the ceiling.
He's been waiting five years for the show.
Sam's bike has been built for three years," adds Adam Zdanowić.
“It was extremely difficult to hide all elements under the body.
There are batteries, wires, building elements.
This is hidden under the body of 11 elements on the steel frame of the bike.
There's also a motor hidden there.
The driver to this bike was set up a week before my trip to the United States at the World Rover Show.
I couldn't finally decide what kind of driver this is going to be.
She's a transporter.
The rover weighs 90 kilograms," he sums up.
The gold-covered bike was rated in Las Vegas as the most important competition category "Best amazing single custom copy".
Film material shows strong pollution of popular tourist sites
The Sydney Bay surrounded by the opera building, the Circular Quay Port, the Luna Park entertainment park and, of course, the famous Harbour Bridge bridge makes a substantial contribution to the amount of $21.9 billion, each year in the Australian economy by tourists visiting Sydney.
But the ugly truth is hidden under the bridge.
The well-known Sydney Bay is one of the most damaged waterways in the country, to which the volume of pollution is equivalent to about 15 Olympic pools per year.
These frightening statistics make one of our biggest tourist assets at the same time one of our most filthy waters.
According to the new film material entitled “The Sydney Valley – up and down”, the waters around Australia’s most popular city are full of debris, plastic nets and bottles, lost shoes and parts of clothing, and even dead animals, all of which flow into the bay with rain showers.
However, most of the storage that breathes our shipping channels is plastic.
"I would call it paradox," says Dr. Katherine Dafforn, deputy director of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, in which the film was published with a view to the World Tourism Day.
This water looks beautiful, but it's one of the most altered and damaged to cross the river along our coast.
The CSIRO Agency estimates that every hour about 1560 kg of plastic is passing into our waterways, and most of it is affected by the sinks through the rapid sewer.
"After such powerful falls of the bay... it seems quite tragic," said Dr. Dafforn.
Two thirds of the pollutants come from rainwater.
However, as with the top of the ice problem with Sydney Bay, it is much more serious under the water surface, as 70% of the plastic coming into the ocean hits the bottom of the sea.
“In my opinion, as long as there is no time under water, it is not really possible to realize what is in the deep there,” said Richard Nichols, owner of the Dive Centre Manly, paying attention to the fact that he and his team draw about 500 kg of plastic from the water on their own.
I think if more people knew (what's under the water), they'd just be scared.
It's pushing... over half of what we find at the bottom are plastic nets.
The other 50% are the things that are at least made of plastic.
When you look at the curtain, it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that all of this plastic and the rest of the garbage we're making is just beneath the surface.
Jeremy Brown, co-founder and director of Ocean Protect, said that there are ways in which people – both local and tourist alike – could help reduce the amount of plastics and the rest of our waterways.
"It must start at the source," he said.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic used by us, better conduct material recovery and have a greater awareness of what we are pouring into the water that eventually reaches the oceans.
If we destroy the ocean, we're starving because 50% of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean.
It's up to 30% of the carbon dioxide and our food source.
However, we can arrange this curtain and restore it to the former glory, which is very simple.
If we die our oceans, we'll kill ourselves too.
The film material financed by the TOMRA recycling company as part of its broader efforts to educate Australians in the field of environmental protection and reduce the negative impact of containers on drinks that often affect the environment takes place in the course of a study on the relationship between artificial products and mental health, the results of which have been published this month.
The new survey carried out among 546 children aged 12 to 18 years found that 82% of respondents felt helpless against plastic waste, and 25% of the adults were affected by the issue of disposable plastic packaging waste.
The study revealed that plastic wastes were also the fourth to the size of the concerns of parents, and 93% of the 551 surveyed parents said that their concerns related to the amount of plastic waste coming into the oceans were growing.
Many people who took part in the study said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they just don't know how to make significant changes, which led to environmental fear.
Poland – Slovenia.
Mems after the match of nets in semifinal ME
It wasn't an easy match.
On their own, the Slovaks had a vital public that effectively deconcentrated Polish netizens.
Many controversys have also been raised by judges who, in one of their actions, have not managed to take four steps on the economic side.
It happened at the key moment of the first set, when the vitals Heynen had the chance to jump off the races and win the first match.
However, this did not happen, and the Polish finally had to recognize the height of the race, which after winning 3:1 in the final tournament.
Ghana: Dealers from Kaneshie Support Psychiatric Hospital in Accra
The members of the Kaneshie Market Associations gave a food worth 30,000 GH yesterday? A psychiatric hospital in Accra during a short ceremony that took place in Accra.
It is an element of trade in the 40th anniversary of the Kaneshie Market Complex.

Google creates a cloud in Poland.
PKO BP partner
The National Cloud Operator, PKO BP and PFR, has launched a strategic partnership with Google.
Cooperation is intended to help Polish companies implement and exploit the potential of computing cloud technology.
Google Cloud Platform products will be included in the offer of the National Cloud Operator, and Google will open in Warsaw called the Google Cloud region – that is to say a hub of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and the Central-Eastern Europe region.
The Google Cloud region will be the first global, public computing cloud installation in Central Europe.
The numbering of Polish companies was one of the key assumptions underlying the project of the creation of the National Cloud, initiated and developed by PKO Bank Poland and by the Polish Development Fund, the participants of the company.
The Country Cloud Partnership and Google are another important step on the road we took a year ago, announcing the call of the State Cloud Operator.
The objective remains unchanged – the digitisation of the Polish economy and the dynamism of its growth.
"Now Polish companies get additional, refined tools for its implementation.
By using them, they increase their chances of advancing to the world league, which we all care about.
The fact that Google joins them today greatly strengthens our joint project," says Zbigniew Jagieło, President of the PKO Bank of Poland.
The Polish Development Fund notes that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern industries and businesses.
“Investment in the National Cloud Operator is ideally included in the PFR strategy as an important element of the country’s digitisation.
It provides modern and affordable business solutions based on cloud architecture.
"I am convinced that this cooperation will also have a positive impact on the development of the Polish IT market and attract the best specialists to it," adds Paweł Borys, PFR president.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products and analytical tools based on leading technical infrastructure, providing computing power and data storage services.
Customers in Poland in the service portfolio will find all key Google Cloud Platform products such as Computer Engine, App Engine, Google Cubenets Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner, or BigQuery.
The inclusion of Google Cloud services in the offer of the National Cloud will allow Polish entrepreneurs to use exactly the same advanced technologies that benefit from their global competition.
We will, however, remain in Polish jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators," says Michał Potoczek, president of the National Cloud Operator.
It adds that the company will be ready for meganets, such as Internet things (IoT), which often increase the need for the calculation power necessary to process huge data collections.

The participants in the joyful choir, at the second known Warsaw and World War II, passed through the Jerusalem Alleys, the Kruczen Street to the Place of Resurrection of Warsaw, the Mazowieck Street to the Place of J. Pilsudski and the Royal and Krakow Street at the Campus of the University of Warsaw.
During the journey, which took part in several thousand seniors representing 300 senior organisations from all over Poland, the colored delegations were welcomed by numerous representatives on the route of the journey, the Warsaw people and tourists.
From Legionau in the parade took part in two organized groups in corporate yellow and blue shirts.
The first representative of the IIIth Century University and the Senior Club+ and the second under the name SAGA, the Senior Active Animators Group.
In Campus, university organizers have prepared gastronomic and large stakes of institutions and companies offering seniors services and products to improve their daily life and functioning.
There were medical, cosmetic, culinary, recreational, sports and fashion stands.
For example, at the Styling Seniors of the Senior Voice from professional Hanny Piekarski and designer Agnieszki Vrwał, you could get tips and information on current trends in fashion 60+.
In addition, Stoisko offered the workshop of learning to move on stage and take pictures.
The wedding was a show of the style of Seniors.
The most recent edition of letters and material on the campaign "Stop manipulation – Don't buy at the presentation" was found at the Stasi of the Polish Senior.
Other stands offered cosmetic, moving, plastic and artistic workshops.
A few studies and consultations with health and nutrition experts could be made.
Discussion panels were also organized with the participation of Helen Norowicz, Beaty Tadli, Marioli Bojarskiej-Ferenc, Tomasz Jacikova or Robert Janowski.
There were no vocal and musical attractions on the picnic.
A Polish song, Krzysztof Krawczyk, was featured on the platform, and the evening was an intergenerational dance that led DJ Wika.
The Tasmanian Devils can provide guidance on cancer treatment
The Tasmanian devils may have the key to cancer treatment – researchers have completed a breakthrough detection that can revolutionize therapy for patients
Medical researchers have discovered how to mask certain cancer cells
Researchers have found that the same process takes place in the Tasmanian devils and in people
There is hope that this discovery will bring new methods of treatment for oncological patients
What do the common Tasmanian devils and people have?
New cells that can become invisible.
Researchers, including Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have made a breakthrough discovery that can help revolutionize the treatment of certain cancers if they do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also include a key to the treatment of mortal tumors within the face, threatening the future of the threatened Tasmanian devil.
The study established a way of masking certain neoplasm cells both in humans and in bags, using a group of proteins called PRC2, which disables the marker that would otherwise signal resistance to the neoplasm attack.
This may be the biggest challenge in the treatment of small cell lung cancer, neuroplastims, and the type of skin cancer called Merkel’s cell cancer.
"The great importance of this project is that in patients who sometimes develop resistance to immunological therapy, we may be able to reverse this process," said AAP chief researcher Mark Dawson of Peter Mac.
Existing therapy may be directed to re-initiate markers, proteins called MHC, which will allow the immune system to recognise the tumour cells.
"It is potentially far-reaching for people with lung cancer," said Professor Dawson.
“It is one of the most common diseases on earth.
And maybe we'll be able to treat her much better.
Researchers also hope that the discovery will sometimes be used to treat the tumors of the Tasmanian devil's face, where new cells similarly avoid detection.
"It is extraordinary that exactly the same process occurs (in the case of human and Tasmanian demons)," said Professor Dawson.
“As it has been, it has been very difficult to treat the bodies of the Tasmanian devils.
But if medicine that works in human beings can also be used in the Tasmanian devils, there is a possibility that it will help control the disease."
Scientists will be surprised that around a really small star, the planet is going to be a very big one.
Scientists are surprised to discover a solar system 30 years of light from the Earth, which subjugates our current understanding of the processes of the creation of planets, because in this system, a large planet like Jowis surrounds a small star called the red man.
Artistic illustration of the planet's natural gas type with GJ 3512b circled around the central star of the red male, published on 26 September 2019.
In general, stars are much larger than even the largest planets surrounding them.
However, as scientists said on Thursday, in this case the stars and the planet are slightly different in size.
The size of the star called GJ 3512 is about 12% of the sun's size, and the mass of the planet that surrounds it is at least half the mass of Jowis, the largest planet of our solar system.
"Yes, it's an absolute surprise," said Astrophysician Juan Carlos Morales of the Catalan Institute of Space Studies at the Spanish Institute of Space Studies, which was the focus of research published in Science magazine.
The discovery is surprising because the theoretical models of solar system formation suggest that low-weight stars usually become maternal stars for smaller planets similar to Earth or smaller Neptunes.
"In this case, we have discovered a planet of a type of ultraviolet gas similar to Jowis surrounding a very small star," Morales added.
The planet that, like Jovisz, consists mainly of gas discovered using a telescope in the Calar Alto observatory in Spain.
It surrounds its star after a very elliptical orbit, and the full circle lasts 204 days.
The red hairs are small and have relatively low surface temperature.
The GJ 3512 star is not only much smaller than the Sun, but to some extent it has a size comparable to the size of a very large planet, as it is only about 35% larger than Jowis.
They emit less energy, so they are lighter than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather low and is about 3800 (degrees) Kelvin (6380 degrees Fahrenheit / 3527 degrees Celsius).
"That's why they have red colors," Morales said.
"There is evidence of the existence of the second planet currently surrounding this star, while the third planet could be expelled from the star system in the past, which can translate an elliptical orbit of a planet similar to the Jowis," Morales said.
The planets are made up of the same interstellar disk of gas and dust that produces a star around which the planets surround.
According to the leading model of the creation of planets called acretion model, the object is originally created from solid particles in the disk, and the gravitational force of the planet in the early stage of development allows for the creation of an atmosphere of surrounding gas.
This non-typical arrangement can explain a competitive model called gravity instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk around a young star may be a little more massive than we expect and may be cold," Morales said.
This leads to a lack of stability in the disc, and some denser areas may appear.
These masses can grow until they fall and create a planet.
Delicate worker charged with the administration of a fasole dipa collaborator containing methamphetamine
The Sheriff's office in Marion County stopped Cassandra Medinius-Hernandez, 38 years old, for the administration of a fasole dipu collaborator containing methamphetamine.
On Thursday, 38-year-old Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernandez was charged with the delivery of methamphetamine and the consumption of that substance controlled by another person – both crimes are crimes of a second degree.
The complaint was lodged on the basis of a 9 September event in the Thriftway food store in Jefferson.
In the statement made by the OregonLive.com portal, which indicates the likelihood of guilt, the 27-year-old suspect's collaborator told the deputy mayor Marion that she saw Medina-Hernandez making a dip of beans, which she then shared.
On the basis of the statement, it is known that the victim of the crime, who, according to what she reported, never took methamphetamines, said that "she thought that one piece eaten by her tasted strangely, but did not arouse any suspicions".
When she got back to work, she felt like she had a stomach spread and she couldn't get up on her feet.
According to the Albanian Democrat-Herald newspaper, she went to a local hospital where it was found that a beans dip could contain methamphetamine.
Based on reports from The Smoking Gun, another police officer said that Medina-Hernandez " told her that she was adding drugs to food", while another admitted that the suspect had sent her message, claiming that methamphetamine had reached a Fasole dip by accident.
The OregonLive site reports on the recording from the delicacy monitoring, which is said to show how the back of the Medina-Hernandez camera pulls something out of the biston, stands behind the microphone and turns away.
Next, it's simple, it cuts the nose, it goes to the table, and it's got a dip of beans in a small paper machine.
According to the police, the thing that she pulled out of the bistonic was probably also on the plate.
The stateman-Journal newspaper reports that the officers of the sheriff's office claim that there is no doubt at present that the customers will be given food.
Medina-Hernandez is in Marion County Prison – the designated bail amount to $520 000.
According to The Smoking Gun portal, her extensive police record indicates that the woman was already convicted of assault, robbery, identity theft, the delivery of methamphetamine, theft, possession of methamphetamine and possession of illegal weapons.
Johnson's giving a hit in the combination of the rejection.
Boris Johnson's trip to the United Nations General Assembly was unethically interrupted by the historical judgment of the Supreme Court.
However, his spousal appearance in the Gmin Chamber did not betray either the shame or the outpouring of conscience.
To explain the meaning of this turn, Tony Connelly, editor of the European RTE section in Brussels and London correspondent Sean Whelan in Westminster, is in the eye of the cyclone.

Marian Banas.
What does KAS do about Chief NIK?
Renting property at a lower market price is reservations that arise in connection with the case of the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control Marian Banasi.
What the treasure is doing in this case is what we asked at the Treasury Office Chamber in Krakow and at the Ministry of Finance.
Bertold Kittel, in a report on "Supervision" TVN, expressed doubts about the statements made by the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control Marian Banasi.
For a few months, the study has been the Central Anti-Corruption Office.
Control is due to end in the second half of October, after parliamentary elections.
According to the statements, Banas was to rent a stone with a surface of 400 square meters and two smaller apartments.
In total, he received 65.7 thousand gold each year.
The Supervision Report revealed that the hotel was located in the stone rented by him for an hour.
Chief NIK later explained on state television why he only picked up over 5,000 gold a month for rent.
The "Vebulous Gazette", referring to experts from the real estate assessment, was estimated to be 15,000 gold a month behind the stone itself.
"The amount was lower for a simple reason: I concluded a preliminary contract and that the tenant was going to buy this stone, led me to agree on a lower order that the remaining items would be settled at the sale of the stone," Banas convinced.
However, doubts arose as to whether such conduct was a violation of the law.
Konrad Zawada, a press spokesman for the Court of Auditors in Krakow, informed the TVN24 that "the Ministry of Finance is directly involved in this matter".
"All such questions please address the Minister of Finance," he added.
Zawada explained that in such cases, "the State Administration is responsible for the operation of the Treasury".
The press spokesman of the Ministry of Finance, Paweł Jurek, admitted that the Treasury Administration itself is monitoring a number of issues that might raise some reservations.
"The Royal Treasurer's Administration operates in such a way that it has its own information, as well as in a sense based on those information which is available to the public.
On this basis, it decides whether or not to conduct any specific proceedings,” the MF spokesman explained.
"But because we all have a treasure secret in the entire financial resource, we never speak, because we cannot speak in individual cases of a particular taxpayer, a particular person, or a particular company," he stressed, asked about the Marian Banasi case.
The Minister of Finance Jerzy Kwiecinski stressed that "the treasury authorities do not communicate this type of message to the public."
"It is known that the whole treasure machine deals with very similar cases throughout the country," he pointed out.
Secrets of the royal family: amazing guests often flying the royal plane were revealed
As part of the service obligations, royal family members must travel hundreds of times around the world.
This usually facilitates the royal aircraft – a private machine that drives the royal family all over the world to important events and events.
It's not surprising that having your own plane is connected to privileges.
Members of the royal family do not have to stand in long rows for recovery, they do not have to be limited to the number of luggage and, as it turns out, they may be invited to board any guests – including those who are really unaccompanied.
According to a recent premiere on Channel 5 of the documentary film, not only the Queen and Prince Philip often travel by royal plane.
During the program entitled "Kingal Flight Secrets" the Royal Flight Navigator revealed that guests often flew with the royal family.
Bob Shields said: "Sometimes with our very important royal guests could fly very important royal dogs."
It is not surprising that the queen could have desired to be accompanied by her beloved lovers in her travels, since she is known for her deep attachment to the race of the race.
Since the youngest years, Queen Elizabeth has been a lover of these quadruple creatures and has been listening to the fact that from the time of the crown, she has been the owner of more than 30 baskets.
It is said that in 2007, she had five baskets: Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow and Holly.
There were five cockers included: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick and Spain, as well as four dogs that are crossword puzzles from the basket: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
The royal aircraft crew must have had full hands.
An employee of the royal house running the dogs was seen asking them to meet their needs before they were taken on board the plane,” says Shields.
I'm glad to say that there's never been an incident.
The programme also revealed a shocking number of luggage that the Queen carries with her on a voyage in the performance of her duties.
The film narrative stated: “In 1953 the queen took 12 tons of luggage in her trip of 70,000 kilometers. ”
To be able to see it better, it's less than two huge elephants.
However, the queen is not the only person who has a weakness for fashion.
Similarly, Princess Cambridge also has her own pleasure in the carriage of her wardrobe – it is said that for each of her dresses there is a private seat.
The new law enters into force.
The injured in cases will receive rent
On Friday, a regulation will enter into force to ensure that, in cases of serious injury, further rent payments will be paid – the Financial Statement informs.
This is the law of 9 July 2019 on the special rights of persons injured in the event of the deduction of the guarantee determined on the basis of the provisions in force before 1 January 2006.
It concerns persons who were injured before 1 January 2006.
At that time, the insurers were definitely less than they are currently guaranteeing, and in some cases the insurers have already stopped paying the rent.
"I am pleased with this regulation because our institution has been running a mechanism for many years to ensure that, in cases of serious damage, financial support for the insurance of the Communications OC or the farmer's OC has been guaranteed,” says Aleksander Daszewski, a legal adviser at the Office of the Financial Officer.
According to the Financial Charter, this was necessary because it is often a very tragic situation for people in very poor health, who, due to the accident, cannot work, for example, and at the same time bear significant costs of accidental rehabilitation treatment.
Some of them have no longer been provided with compensatory rents and for increased needs in view of the need for further treatment or rehabilitation due to the so-called 'guarantee sum' in the OC fields.
Part of it was a threat in the next few years.
By 1 January 2006, the liability of the insurer was significantly lower than the present level.
That is why the problem of exhausting the guarantee amount in previous years has most often affected people who have suffered injury in the 1990s.
At the time, the guarantee amounts were very low and the economic conditions led to a significant increase in prices.
"We have also noted that this problem has also affected a number of mostly young people who have suffered injury during the period when the amount was 350 thousand euros per case.
Currently, this is EUR 5.21 million for the event, regardless of the number of injured.
This is therefore a huge difference in relation to the previous periods, from which the problem required the intervention of the legislator," recalls Alexander Daszewski.
In view of the fact that the amount of the guarantee at some time is raised, the legislator has accepted that the above limit of liability of the Guarantee Fund will be the amount of the guarantee in force at the time of referral to the Fund for the payment of the rent.
This principle applies if the insurance undertaking is not obliged to pay the rent on the basis of a judgment establishing the amount of the guarantee other than that laid down in the OC Insurance Agreement.
This shall take place in the event of an increase in the guarantee amount on a judicial basis pursuant to Article 3571 of the Civil Code, which allows for a modification of the existing binding relationship.
“In the last days we have sent letters to people who have been returning to us in the past with an application for intervention.
We inform them of new privileges and of course ensure that further support can be given if any problems arise," says Alexander Daszewski.

Brenda Barattini convicted of cutting off the boy's penis
The case concerns events since November 2017.
According to Buenos Aires Times, then Brenda Barattini found out that her boyfriend showed a familiar sextatism that arose in their bedroom.
The 28-year-old, who is an architect of education, explained before the court that the partner in this way ruined her life and treated her as a “tropheum” that can be praised in the presence of friends.
"He violated my intimacy, my life and my career.
He destroyed everything," she argued.
The resident of Cordoby decided to measure justice himself.
She invited her boyfriend, 42-year-old Sergio F. to bed and told him she had a special surprise.
By means of an aximite, she blinded his eyes, and then she caught a segator and cut off his penis.
"I felt like I was supposed to die.
I didn't see anything.
I tried to get up, I pulled down, and I picked up the cell phone to call the guards," he said.
"I wanted to go out, but she started hurting me.
She caught me for a shirt and hair, not allowing me to leave," he added.
Although Barattini explained that her boyfriend had hurt her by revealing sextatism, she did not try to escape responsibility.
"Please measure justice," she said in the direction of the jury.
She was finally convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to 13 years in prison.
Former state congressman Alabama Jack Edwards died at the age of 91
On Friday, the retired Alabama State Congressman of the Republican Party, Jack Edwards, died, who served for 10 years and belonged to the first wave of Republicans from the so-called Deep South.
Family spokesman said that Edwards died in his home in Fairhope after fighting a car accident.
Edwards was first elected to the American Congress in 1965 as one of the first Republicans of Alabama in the Deep South because of the party's winning supporters here.
At the Congress, he served 10 appointments.
According to a statement issued by the family in response to a recent question about what the world would want to leave to its lawyers and lawyers, Edwards replied that he would want to return kindness.
"I hope that my lawyers and my lawyers will grow up in a country where a common debate and efforts to solve the problems of the country will be beneficial," said Edwards, according to the family statement.
The Governor of Alabama Kay Ivey said that Edwards served his position and country with the highest standards of honesty.
She added that on his behalf a flag on Alabama State Capitol will be left to half the mast.
"He was a true state official and was the best man for Alabama.
Our state has lost one of the most important policies," Ivey said in a statement.
Michelle Obama calls Meghan Markle "inspiration" on Instagram
Michelle Obama expressed high respect for Meghan Markle at Instagram on Thursday, calling Princess Sussex "a caring leader who breaks the schemes and makes our world better."
The Prince and Prince Harry, currently on a ten-day trip to South Africa with their son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, participated in a youth meeting at the beginning of this week, during which they met with the leaders of the Obama Foundation.
"I would like to thank my friend, Her Royal City, Princess Sussex @sussexroyal, "a treacherous leader who breaks the schemes and makes our world better," wrote the first lady in her enthusiastic post.
"Is this meeting with the Obama Foundation leaders @ObamaFoundation, or helping girls around the world to gain access to the education they deserve is an inspiration for many people," Obama added, adding a picture showing a smiling Meghan looking at the foundation leaders.
Meghan conducted an interview with Obama for the September edition of the British Vogue, hosted by the former actor of the series "Suits".
In a sincere conversation, she was the first lady to talk about the motherhood and how she changed it.
"To be a mother means to lead to the art of forgiveness," said Obama in an interview.
“Materialism taught me that for most of my time it is my job to give children space so that they can get to know the world and become whom they want to be.
Not who I want to be, or who I wanted to be, in their age, but who's in the heart.
Obama, who knows from experience what the pressure of being on the church is, shared with the church council during the interview with the Good Housekeeping magazine.
“The pressure you feel – thrown by yourself and others – may sometimes push you” she said.
"My advice is, therefore, to relax and not hurry at all.
For the first few months in the White House, I spent most of my time worrying about my daughter, making sure that they were doing well at school and making new acquaintances before I devoted myself to more ambitious work.
I think it's necessary, too.
Hotel Trump retains a permit for the sale of alcohol despite complaints for the owner's training
WASHINGTON (AP) – The Washington Alcohol Control Commission has withdrawn the request to verify whether the local Trump International Hotel should lose its authorisation to sell alcohol because of the owner’s equipment.
The Agency has held that the complaint of three pastors, two retired judges and two rabbis is unfounded, because most of them do not live in or have no property in the district.
"The Washington Post" says that the second time you have an interest in withdrawing the hotel's permit for the sale of alcohol, referring to the legislation in force in the district saying that the applicants for the sale of alcohol must prove to be "good qualified".
In the original complaint lodged last year, President Donald Trump was alleged to be breaking the law, and charges of assault and repeated cases of fraud were brought.
The complaint was withdrawn because the authorisation was granted before it was lodged.
The reason for the second complaint was the extension of the authorisation.
"The Sun": An intermittent report recognizes that Cleveland's police service scandal is the worst in Britain.
The inspectors recognized the SCOMPROMITOWAN SCANDALAM police as the worst in the United Kingdom.
In the interim report, they assessed the work of the Cleveland police as inappropriate in all areas.
Phil Gormley of the Chief Police Inspectorate of Her Royal City states that in Cleveland police services there was a "significant deterioration" of standards.
New calls for police services were made, and five commanders were appointed in six years' time.
According to the report, police did not try to prevent crime, arrest the suspects and protect the weakest.
Phil Gormley of the Chief Inspectorate of Her Royal City said: "From our last inspection there has been a significant deterioration in standards."
Commander Mike Veale resigned in January after a year's incapacitated in the face of an investigation into "significant" and uninvited charges for his conduct.
Deputy Commander Adrian Roberts was suspended after the arrest on the grounds of flagrant negligence.
Last year, Inspector Simon Hurwood stood before the Committee on Extraordinary Procedures for the Adaptation of Workers to Sexual Activity.
He's out of service.
Mayor Tees Valley Ben Houchen said: “It is official confirmation that these services are compromised.
It's time for the Home Office department to be involved."
Police Commander Richard Lewis said: "After the improvements, I take full responsibility for the conduct of police forces through changes."
We have a skatepark visualization!
Do young people finally wait?
Older residents are hampered by young people’s passions to drive in the hooligans and skirmishes, and they complain that there is no suitable place for them in Olava.
For years, young people have been reminded of the place to drive on rollers, discometers, hooligans, bikes.
The subject is still coming back to our fractures.
For 10 years, we've been paying attention to this problem.
Last time there was a rumor about the lack of a skatepark.
That's why we're going back to that again and asking the office what's next?
We remember that a few days ago, a woman who was upset by the young man who was driving in the center.
"I am writing on behalf of the inhabitants of the block at Pl. Pilsudski so that you can be interested in the situation of the Olava youth," Malgorzat writes.
“The people of the block called several times to the City Guard in vain.
I sent pictures to prove these everyday situations together."
We have asked others about this matter.
Most clearly say that young people simply do not have a place to drive in the city and for years they have no real need for a place for themselves.
The Facebook post showed up with the lion's comments.
We wrote in July that there was a chance that a skatepark would be built in the city of Olava.
The mayor informed that the city had been funded to build a skatepark.
‘The project is ready to be consulted with young people with permits.
On 28 March, an application was made to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism for the financing of the task of the "Bodow Skatepark in Olava" in the framework of the Polish Sport Programme", we were told in the office.
Total project value: 798 306,00 zł.
Amount of funding requested: 263 440,00 zł.
Now we've been asking again what's the point.
"We do not yet have any information on the relationship between the solutions made to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism to the request for funding," Elżbieta Bednarczyk, head of the UM Olawa European Fund.
"The information received from the Ministry staff indicates that the final selection of all tasks under the Polish Sport Programme should take place in October."
We also asked for a visualization of the lead skate park.
We're presenting it below.
The youth informed the editor that on Saturday (September 28th) they would collect signatures on a petition concerning the construction of the Skatepark in Olava.
"The rebel youth saw the last post on Facebook and came to the conclusion that they were organizing a collection," writes Mikolaj.
The signatures under the petition will be collected from 12 a.m. around the Lidl market.
Puchar Polski 2019/20: casting 1/16 final.
We know couples, hit years ago
It was one of the most intense rivals in the extraclass.
The biggest legend was the 1996/1997 season memory game.
On 18 June 1997, Legia took the previous team at the old stadium at the Lazinkska Shipyard.
Both teams shared a point.
The masters had to win, the second of the Polish championships gave the Widzew second.
Up to 87 minutes Legia drove 2:0, but for five more minutes it reached the earthquake – Vidzew shot three goals and enjoyed the title.
The Łódź club with years of running fell into increasing tarapats until it stopped fighting for the championship and fell from the highest playing class.
For the last time, both teams met at this level in the 2013/2014 season.
Legia – along the way to the title – took two victories – 5:1 and 1:0 on her way out.
Return to power
At present, the ship is fighting to return to the national elite.
These plans have been delayed for at least a year, as in previous games being one of the favorites could not advance to the extraclasses.
As a result of this failure of the summer, the club has reached a military revolution.
The authorities have changed, finally put on coach Marcina Kaczmark, and in taking another step up the club hierarchy they have to help in the league fights Marcin Robak and Mateusz Možžženj.
At the time of Vidzew is fourth in Table II of the League, but in Puchare Polski won the winner of the Łłęsk Wrocław 2:0 extraclass on Tuesday.
Legia, in the same size, threatened to leave the Nepalmice Desert.

Nancy Pelosios: William Barr "suffered" and an investigation within the impeachment must deal with his torch
We never know where we're going.
In my opinion, we are now taking part in an attempt to hide the facts, and the investigation in this matter may continue," Pelosi said in a report to the CNN on the Capitol Hill.
"They are doing the work they started, keeping the facts and the time they needed to find them," she added.
The protocol issued this week by the White House shows that Trump requested the President of Ukraine to conduct an investigation into former Vice-President Joe Biden, candidate for 2020, and his son.
Trump also asked the Greens to cooperate with Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on the basis of the protocol.
Trump refused to do anything wrong.
On Thursday, CNN reported that national security lawyers from the Justice Department have notified the complaint filed by the complainant concerning the procedure of the Trump with the participation of Ukraine more than one week before the formal notice.
After receiving a complaint in the form of a complaint from the officials of the Intelligence Community, the Justice Department found that Trumpa’s telephone conversation did not provide a criminal investigation into the financing of the campaign.
Asked whether Barr should testify, Pelosi said that on Friday the Intelligence Committee decides who to call a witness.
She added, however, that in Barr’s view, she “demonstrated”.
It's been like this for a long time.
"The (Barra) trades in all of this," Pelosi added, referring to Trump's reference to his Attorney General during July's talks with the head of Ukraine.
Interestingly, he made decisions on how to deal with the complaint.
Pelosi announced that he was "very afraid" of the informants that Trump attacked on Thursday as spies, suggesting that in the past he had been treated with spies.
I think the President's words go beyond responsibility, it's dangerous.
Our signalers play an important role in discovering – sending out advances in our government," Pelosi said, adding "The President's words about people who can provide information, signalers seriously underestimate the integrity of the government".
On Tuesday, Pelosi carried out a historic step of a formal investigation into the conduct of an act incompatible with the law on the basis of a charge of attempting to impose pressure on the leader of a foreign country in order to obtain political benefits.
The telephone conversation was included in the composition published on Thursday of the complaint, in which the signaler claimed that Trump had abused his authority to "submit Ukraine to interference" during the upcoming 2020 elections.
The signaler also proposed that the White House's lawyers have instructed the officials to delete the entry from the computer system in which they are stored for the needs of the Council of Ministers and to place it in the system for particularly sensitive information.

Possible ban on driving too fast for a terrorist club Crystal Palace Christian Bentece
The Premier League Christian Bentece star, which has been caught twice in the last two months, threatens to ban driving.
The attacker Crystal Palace, 28 years old, granted himself to drive by Bentley's car at 80 miles per hour on the ground with a limit of up to 50 miles per hour on the A3 road in Richmond in south-western London on 20 January.
Then in March in Putney, a photographer in South-West London registered a Belga eating at 89 miles per hour, which is a double limit of 40 miles per hour.
Bentece from Kingston Hill from Surrey doesn't have to be in court this morning at Lavender Hill.
He was granted two extensions at the beginning of July in a simplified procedure, on the basis of which offences are more likely to be brought before a meeting of a judge of peace.

Ghana: Kofi Manu is concerned about the structure of the WR
Kofi Manu, football manager and club representative Sekondi Hasaacas, expressed doubts about the composition of the Vocational Commission for the upcoming elections to the National Football Union in Ghana (GFA).
He questioned the Commission's President Frank Davies' involvement, adding that he was not pleased with his participation.
In the GNA Sport Manu interview, he expressed doubts as to whether the President of the Commission would be honest, as the result of the verification process lies in his interest.
The Audit Commission should consist of neutral outside persons who do not show links to any member and who have not previously shown interest.
For example, Davies has been employed by the NC as a lawyer who wrote to Osei Kwak Palmer about 10 per cent of the payment.
He is also a well-known fan of the Olympic Games.
For these two reasons, he should not be allowed to take a position in the Audit Committee because he is interested in it," he said.
Manu stated that if Fred Pappoe, Director of the Olympic Games, would appear before the Commission, there would be a conflict of interest on the part of the President because of his relationship with the club, while suggesting that if Palmer would be before the Commission, he would be the subject of prejudice and bias.
As expected, the members of the Commission had to start their work from yesterday, following a ceremony at the GFA Secretariat in Accra on Tuesday, 19 September, and finish it on 4 October.
The President of the Commission is Frank Davies and her members are Consultant of the Corporate Board and Judge Marian Barnor and Emmanuel Darkwah.
The other members are Reginald Laryea, Director of Marketing and Business and Richard Akpokavije, Director of Sports and Law.

Now, however, the condition of the Prime Minister's health has deteriorated considerably.
Cornel Morawiecki has reached the hospital, and the doctors determine his condition as difficult.
The senior's family told the SE that politics is aware and fully aware.
The new pancreas is not the only disease that Cornel Morawiecki is dealing with.
He also has heart problems, and due to the chemotherapy he undergoes, also with his kidneys.

Israel: There is no agreement on the unity government
The two main parts of Israel, the Alliance of White and White, continued negotiations on the establishment of the unity government on Friday.
The meeting, which took place after the President had commissioned the formation of the Benjamin Netanyahu government, did not produce results.
The discussions considered the possibility of rotating both parties' leadership in the government and remaining Netanyahu at the Prime Minister's office, but, as the Israeli daily Haarec writes, there was no convergence of views.
The talks will be resumed on Sunday.
The Central Alliance of Heaven-Whites informed in the communication that he presented the preliminary submissions.
He accuses Likud of being "regarding his position", demanding that his leader and former Prime Minister, Netanyahu, remain at the head of the government, and in the office's membership, which was previously part of his ultra-orthodox policy.
"From the very beginning it was known that the Blue-Beials would not agree to these conditions," the communication was published by them.
Because, acting solely in the interest of Netanyahu, he wants to "in Israel to move to the second round of elections".
Benny Gantz, the heavenly-White Leader, rejects the support of the government that would lead Netanyahu, until they bear the burden of a charge of participation in three corruption cases, on which the prosecution could formally accuse him on Wednesday.
"In the elections on 17 September, the people and the Whites received a sufficient majority, which would allow them to join the common governments as natural allies, but it forces them to negotiate, which none of the parties wanted," writes the EFE Agency.
President Reuwen Rowlin has been trying to bring their positions closer in recent days and has proposed the call for a "rotating government", suggesting that the Prime Minister temporarily suspend his duties, which would allow Gantz to take up this position if the charges against Netanya were maintained and formalised.
There are no Israeli analysts who believe that things have ended in a blind alley.
However, half of the Israelis, as a result of a survey published on Friday by public television, wish to unlock the political situation in the country by calling the government of units under the rotating leadership to change Netanyahu and Gantza.
This solution is reported by 50.6% of the Israelis, 32.1% of the respondents opposes such a solution.
The survey shows a deep division in the Israeli society – on the question who should first stand at the office, 41.8% of respondents speak to Netanyahu, and 40% to Gantze.
In another survey published by the Israel Hague Journal, the percentage of members of the unity government is 63%, 60% opposed to the new elections, which would be third this year.
In the preliminary parliamentary elections on 17 September, Gantza's alliance won 33 terms in the 120-place Kneset, Liqued Netanyahu defeated 32 terms.
The settlement with its traditional and potential allies can count on 55 ambassadors, while Gantz is 54.
None of the biases have collected 61 mandates required to obtain a majority.
Tipuric calls for a fight before the final game with Australians
Justin Tipuric says that "it's time to check out", when Valia faces the final game with Australia under the World Cup, which can shape their fates in the tournament.
The victory of Valia over the kangaroos would put this team in the position of a certain favorite to win Group D and guarantee its participation in the likely quarterly meeting with France or Argentina.
However, if Australia beats Wallia once 14. during the last 15 meetings, Tipuric and his team will be sent to England in a flash at the beginning of one eight finals.
"Let's make the case clear, both teams want to try and go to the front of the group," said the Valianian warrior Tipuric.
In the past, there were some difficult results, but it was nice to win with them (Australia) last autumn.
I think they're going to be impatient to take over this victory, and we're going to have to take it back.
Before we got here, you knew it was gonna be a big old man.
And now we're here, and it's really time to check it out.
Valia won only one victory over Australia, New Zealand or RPA in the history of the World Cup – which took place 32 years ago in a third-place match when the kangaroo were defeated.
And their total record under the lead of Chief Coach Warren Gatland shows only seven victories in 41 attempts to defeat three heavyweight teams from the South.
Valia represented thirteen of Australia's lost test matches in November last year, and Tipuric prepared to be among the few saved from this 9-6 victory that will run to the Tokyo stadium on Sunday.
Tipuric asked whether the team had experienced psychological blockades before the victory, adding: “It’s hard to say.
These swords are so balanced that maybe... people expect a mental blockade to occur, I don't know.
At the end of the last match, we were probably left on the battlefield about 15 points, so the final result seems to be much less advantage than it actually was.
If Valia tumbling, then the battle of Tipurica with a favorite Australian duo from the third line will be of fundamental importance to Michael Hooper and David Pocock during the arrest and defeat.
Tipuric played 67 meetings in representation colors and met with both contestants on a number of previous occasions, so he knows exactly what's waiting for him.
"These are the players playing in the position of the seventh absolutely world class," he said.
When it's against the world class of third line runners, it's always known that it's gonna be a hard game to play.
These two are always with the best racers in the world.
You know what games you can expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world playing defensively, and Michael is more attacking the seventh and probably better feeling the rugs, because he's always in the right place at the right time.
It's better to play against the best racers in the world and face challenges than to measure with the third line of milk, which is not so good.
It's worth playing against the best, and by competing with these two, I'm sure you need to be in the top form.
I wouldn't say that Sunday's about to happen that he's finished the match, but it's an important game for us in this World Cup.
Impet is its important element.
When we build strength and continue to make great efforts, we will fly like wings, and it will be hard to overcome.

They were supposed to be an elite organisation of the "gentle race".
They've adopted in their range those they've guarded.
Could a crime be more powerful than national identity?
In your hands, we have no more war or military books.
We are conducting a deep international study on the participation of non-Germans in the Waffen-SS.
Historians from various European countries are examining the attitudes and motivations of the volunteers, recalling their activities and looking at the recruitment process at various stages of the war.
Did the Danish branches differ from the French?
Where did Ukrainian enthusiasm come from?
Why couldn't we create a division made up of the Poles themselves?
What is the official historical narrative of cooperation in each European country today?
What happened to the volunteers after the war ended?
Among other questions, the Waffen-SS book answers on the basis of solid research material.
We sought to present a more subtle and more balanced, closer image of cooperation in Europe during the second world war, also trying to break the methodological boundaries of historiography and a given period of action by presenting the debate of the research authority from different countries. (...) While the main casualties of this war - forced workers, Jews, nuns, Nazi political opponents Germany, Slovenian people - are sometimes presented in a comparative and/or supranational way, as well as in the international perspective (if they do so).
"Total panic" when the White House struggles to find arguments about impeachment
White House officials are ashamed to find out how to resist the renewed emphasis on impeachment on Thursday, and one of the speakers who are familiar with the situation describes the feeling of "total panic" that was felt last week due to the lack of a response plan to the new reality.
It seems that this is the case of "an anxiety, uncertainty and fear" - one of the people involved in the White House describes the mood in the western wing in this way - that the accusations of the informant can seriously harm the president and the people around him.
This person said, "There is no doubt that nothing is hidden there."
White House officials were still uncertain how to proceed, not only because there is no clear plan of action in such a situation, but also because they are so serious that standard methods of avoiding effective controversy used by the president in the past may not work. "It does not look like something that disappears along with the emergence of another cycle of headlines" – this person complained.
Another person who knows the debate described the atmosphere in the White House as "a state of shock", accompanied by growing mistrust that along with the ongoing investigation of impeachment, the President would be more likely to respond unresponsibly and become "hard to control".
This concern is shared by another speaker who claims that people from the president's environment expect him to show more "permanent" behaviour, and the pressure on him will certainly increase with each day of the impeachment investigation.
This raises the concern that Trump can present increasingly unpredictable behaviour and in an unexpected way – this is in the context of the election year both from the presidency's point of view and from the elections.
Faced with the greatest threat to the presidency so far, Trump circled from the attack to the defense, again reaching out to the strategy that he considered to be effective during Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia.
He tried to enrich his own request to the Ukrainian president for assistance in investigating his political rivals to turn attention to and focus on the actions of the Democrats and Democratic Candidates of Jo Biden and to discredit the informant as a driving force of the party.
But while many people in the White House are engaged in the fight after the search for Mueller, this time something changed – counselors and consultants said.
The president, whose reputation is a force, has shown the media conference as a defeat – one of the people who are familiar with the situation.
While Trump eagerly accepted questions about the Russian investigation, he seemed reluctant to answer questions about Ukraine – they said.
Some of the president's associates believe that it is possible to avoid harm, and some of them hold that the informant did not know from the first hand about the controversial telephone conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenski – which they consider to be unreliable.
And as often as the president is the object of the attacks, the fact is that he is raised alive by his main proponents in his defense.
But one of the Republic's White House-related strategies indicates that the results of the presidential support polls are poorly high, and impeachment does not have much impact on the achievement of new sympathies.
"There is no point in focusing on the President's influence over the next four months," especially if it makes it difficult for his legislative programme and prevails in the new cycle of headlines.
Another speaker argues that those who held that the impeachment would help the president did not finally understand how unforeseeable his reaction would be.
Concerned White House officials sought help with counsellors by completing the impeachment response team.
According to the person who knows about the plans, taking into account that these efforts are at an early stage, it remains unclear whether any initiatives in the management centre will be taken and what form can be taken.
This person stated that he was convinced that a coordinated legal and communication strategy was required with a determined leader who was able to carry out an attack on the PR in response to the publication of the edible report of the signist and aimed at stopping the spread of the democratic action on the impeachment of the report.
The speaker on the situation maintains that the lack of a long-term strategic vision was clearly evident when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasure Secretary Steve Mnuchin stated that they did not intend to disclose the notes describing Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president and then 48 hours later it could be felt that there was no exit and that the document should be published.
It is expected that the pressure will now be greater than during Robert Mueller's investigation, which mainly kept silence and spoke only through accusations. One of the people who can be involved in the preparation of the response to impeachment is Corey Lewandowski, a man from the dirty work of Trump and former head of the election staff – a person related to the case.
However, Lewandowski said in a conversation with NBC News that it is not a true suggestion that he will lead this action.
"For the past five years, I have done everything I can to support the president and his programme," he said, "but I have not been involved in any talks with the president or his team to join the team in order to reject a false narrative about the impeachment."
The private lawyer Donald Trump from Mueller's investigation, Jay Seculow, also remains involved in impeachment.
"We are responding to matters as appropriate" - Seculow replied when asked by NBC News for a comment.
Currently, the White House feels the lack of an experienced lawyer in the impeachment, after as Emmet Flood, who worked at Clinton's impeachment and advised the White House at the end of Mueller's investigation, left, and the current advisor, Pat Cipollone, has no such experience.
The speaker, familiar with the White House's strategy, stated that officials generally did not plan to engage people at any time or to create a centre of leadership, but acknowledged the need for a coordinated, joint response and a possible political struggle.
Visitor Explorer of the Seas line Royal Caribbean passed repair for 89 million pounds
The explorer of the Seas, belonging to the Royal Caribbean International family, will take this year on a trip, presenting a completely new look.
After the restoration, which has drained the impressive 110 million dollars (89 million pounds), the ship boasts a wide selection of culinary flavors from all over the world and a rich offer of entertainment for the whole family.
This year, Explorer will stop at the most wonderful ports in Italy and Greece, allowing passengers to feel the taste of the Mediterranean Europe.
When the adventure on land reaches its end, the crew of the ship promises unforgettable impressions on the sea.
Having a satisfactory offer for everyone, the explorer, after renovating the cost of $110 million, which amounted to about $89 million, moved to a passenger ship that provides perfect entertainment for the entire family.
The impressive technology means that passengers can surf on board through advanced surfing simulators or watch favorite family film, using weather clocks, in plenary cinema.
However, the most revolutionary attraction is to add virtual balconies that allow passengers of the interior cabins to admire the ocean views without having to leave on board.
Water lovers will be attracted to a new deck at the pool connecting the Caribbean style of the water park.
The pool is surrounded by beach hammocks and beds ideal for sunsets, and two modernized rides are in the hands of people who are eager to have strong impressions on board.
An attractive traveler for passengers of every age imposes the number of activities available to guests during the trip to destination.
Created with a view to small adventure Ocean for children, it is a chance for younger family members to have beautiful memories, and the exclusive place to spend free time for teenagers offers super games and a music area prepared for people over 12 years of age.
If this proves to be insufficient, the entire family may in "Study B" on the ship be involved in the laser tag player with the effect of lighting in the dark, which can also be impressively served as ice-cream on the ski slopes.
During the trip to the Mediterranean, guests will also have the opportunity to get to know exotic tastes from all over the world, making their way to the bottom of the restaurant on board.
The modern Asian cuisine is offered on a ship in the restaurant Izumi, and in the newly opened Giovanni's Italian Kitchen is an excellent food inspired by the innovative look at the traditional Italian cuisine.
Other gastronomic points on board include an American restaurant offering Chops Grille steaks, a Latin bar Boleros, a Schooner Bar and an express bar Johnny Rockets.
The trip, with the option of seven- or ninety-two-day route, will come from Rome in May 2020.
As a second European ship belonging to the Royal Caribbean line, it will join the Allure of the Sea, which has recently passed an incredible repair.
After 58-day Allure metamorphosis, in the amount of $165 million, the tour operator offered guests who had previously made reservations, a voucher worth $300 to be issued on board the ship.
The tour operator stated: “Explorer of the Seas is the fourth ship of the Voyager class, which will undergo a transformation into the modernization of the Royal Amplified Fleet."
The program, which requires investment of more than $1 billion, covering 10 ships and lasting four years, improves every aspect of customer satisfaction and introduces a wide range of possibilities: from unrepeatable attractions and survive gastronomics after nightlife.
Devin Nunes accuses the Democrats of calling for "trumpa's naked photos"
Congressman Devin Nunes from the state of California is clearly not able to refute the sudden truth that President Donald Trump is involved in the investigation.
In his Thursday defense, the President accused the Democrats of wanting to receive naked photos of the President.
Nunes, a high-ranking Republican in the Commission of the Conference of Representatives, made the above offer during the preliminary statement during the hearing on the result of the complaint, as if Trump had turned to Ukraine for assistance in initiating an investigation against the Democratic candidate for President Joe Biden and his son.
The congressman called the Ukrainian scandal "a grotesque presentation" of the left and their "medial ace" before he found that the Democrats wanted to see the pictures of the president in the neighborhood.
"Democrats in this committee were negotiating with people they thought were Ukrainians to get naked pictures of Trump," Nunes said.
“People can rightly ask why Democrats are so determined to put the president in charge of the prosecution when they have their chance in a year.
When Nunes finished giving the publicity, the political reporter of the HuffPost website, Jennifer Bendery, decided to see if the Democrats really were trying to... find out.
So far, only the representative Connecticut, Jim Hims, has responded, although we suspect that his answer is a sudden truth, which confirms the thoughts of many of his colleagues and colleagues.
The Mediaite.com Portal suspects that Nunesa's comments on nudity were related to "some more pleasant and unconfirmed information", which is likely to appear in Steele's controversial documents,
It is celebrated, collected by former British spy Christopher Steele's collection of charges against Trump, pointing to the probability of the existence of a tape, which at midnight shows him watching the violence of prostitutes in the hotel room in Moscow.
Potential studies on renewable biofuels can help reduce emissions
While electric cars and Sami Tesli have dominated information services in recent years, one issue seems to be the removal of renewable energy – aircraft.
However, a professor at Alberta University has developed a technology that will allow renewable biofuels to be used as a fuel for aviation.
Dr David Bressler is a professor at the University of Albert at the Department of Agriculture, Life and the Environment, who started work on this project in 2003.
Its laboratory develops hydrocarbons derived from fatty wastes, such as restaurant fat, animal fat and waste oil.
In contrast to ethanol and other biofuels, this technology may use lower quality oils during production, which is estimated to account for 85% lower carbon emissions than in the case of oil fuels, as well as the use of waste from other industries.
This technology is intended to imitate hydrocarbons present in oil fuels.
"What our technology did in the first generation," said Bressler, "is [in total] hydrocarbons that are identical particles as in diesel."
While this opens up the new possibility of biofuel use, previously developed biofuel products were prone to destabilization at lower temperatures, which was a serious threat to aircraft flying at high altitudes.
"The problem with fuel is a bit of a wrong circle," Bressler said.
It's really less worth than diesel, but it has higher requirements.
The Bressler Laboratory is currently looking at two options for the production of aerial biofuel.
The first option is a low-risk approach that requires additional treatment of hydrocarbons and addition of hydrogen.
The second option is to continue work on partially developed chemical properties that will provide fuel stability, even at low temperatures.
"We can experiment with chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a little," said Bressler, commenting on another option.
This option is more risky.
Forge Hydrocarbons, a company founded by the University of Alberta, is working on commercializing the product, as airlines, as well as the Canadian and American armies increase investment in a renewable option.
"They are able to imagine the times in which the situation can be reversed and carbon tax will be imposed on them," he said.
Instead, they want an alternative that's going to be an emergency plan.
Forge is currently operating a pilot plant near the Edmonton Waste Management Centre and has recently received a sum of $4 million from Lockheed Martin as part of an investment to support a costing $25 million in the construction of the production plant, which will be located in Sombra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce about 19 million litres of biofuel annually.
Bressler also notes that the planned reduction in coal will be about 85 per cent, but issues such as transport and fuel production will stop further reductions in coal.
"As a technology specialist," Bressler said,
I have the task of developing options that allow for informed decisions and many options to be chosen."
FOOD: Another cheating on the granddaughter
Eight thousand dollars and 750 euros lost the property of Zamosta, thinking that it helped his grandson, who caused the accident.
The police informed him of the incident on Thursday, the son of a cheated bastard.
"He called the woman in the middle of the man who gave up for her grandson.
He told me he had an accident and needed money.
Otherwise he'll be in jail.
The senior wanted to help the grandson, she handed 8 thousand dollars and 750 euros to the fake cop who came to her house," says Asp. Dorota Krukowska-Bubila from the foreign police.
The police are looking for agents and next time they call for caution:
‘Each phone with a request for financial assistance must be verified.
Do not act under the influence of emotion and in a hurry.
Remember, the cops don't ask for money and they don't take money.
If we receive a call asking for financial support, which will stimulate our suspicions, we should respond immediately and notify the police by calling on alert number 112.
We also appeal to younger family members.
Let's talk to our seniors about threats, let's let them know how deception works.
Please be careful and do not trust those who call and ask for a loan."
The allies of Prime Minister Boris Johnson warn that when the British Brexit is lifted, the US threatens the US as in Los Angeles, and he himself calls for peace.
One of the main cabinet ministers said last night that the country was threatened with "a major social collapse", if the original result was challenged by the result of the second referendum.
The British Prime Minister's colleagues from his immediate surroundings warned that the country was threatened with social problems on the scale of the "Yellow Camilles" protests in France due to social inequalities and interference in Los Angeles in 1992.
Johnson called for "peace of mind" during a heated debate on the language of politics, but stressed that he would not stop using the word "rejection".
Despite his call for peace, the cabinet minister said "The Times": "There have never been protests in this country such as demonstrations of "gilets juvies" ("yellow chameleks") or of residents of Los Angeles in 1992.
People think it's impossible just because they didn't happen before.
Now they have an example – young gilets – they use encrypted phones that can coordinate pizzas, and to get people to protest, there are only a few unwelcome populist leaders.
The residents of Los Angeles exploded after the jury executed four white policemen who had taken over the black man's cab driver Rodney King in 1992.
This year, anti-government demonstrators in France wearing yellow gowns – young yolks – have been deserting and growing the streets of Paris for more than six weeks.
The Minister referred to Johnson's warning in the Gmin Chamber and said that if Britain fails to leave the EU, there will be "a catastrophic loss of confidence in our political system".
"If we hold a referendum in which 30 million people vote, 66% of them will go after the United Kingdom in the European Union, and ten million citizens will be unhappy," the minister said.
Even if that result ignores 99% of them, we will have 100,000 angry people who will write to their own emissaries and who will not forgive.
A lot of people don't need to see a few thousand people on the street soon.
One of the prime ministers of the cabinet added that the country is threatened with "a major social breakdown", if the result of the first referendum is challenged by the result of the second.
Johnson called for a general election to be held in which the voters would decide on the Brexit fate.
According to the report, the prime minister is facing the risk of a cabinet bomb that wants to reduce the demand for a break and reach a compromise agreement with the EU at this point.

Follow us Talk'N"Roll
Over 300 participants listened on Thursday (September 26th) 11 inspiring performances of lecturers, including Szymon Holovnia, Krystyna Czubavna or Ireneusz Krosna.
This is all part of the Talk'N'Roll conference that took place in Krakow for the fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Expanding the horizons, talking about the sound of voice, and sharing discussions that can be a driving force for further development.
These objectives were presented by the organizers of the Talk'N'Roll conference, inviting 11 exceptional lecturers, representing very diverse sectors and areas of interest, among them, among others known from the media - Simona Holovnj, Kristina Chubovna and Ireneus Krosno.
This year's talk'N'Roll was "Crafting the Future, NOW" and just around the creation of the future, the guests were focused on participating in the conference.
The first session was opened by the director of the management of Sabre Polska, Sebastian Drzewiecki, who told us how the brand that is built around him can affect our future.
Richard Lucas went to the scene to change the public's perception of the phenomenon of rejection, claiming that it should be accepted if the future was to be created, Chris Badura took on the issue of empathy in the face of bright technological development.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) was divided into observations and techniques that can help manage careers and increase overall satisfaction by finding an appropriate balance between professional and private life.
The second part of the conference opened a wide-ranging discussion with Kristina Czubavna, which told among other things how her perspective on space changed the lecturer’s career in Poland.
The owner of one of the most popular voices in the country admitted that, thanks to development technology, everyone today can make a challenge for this profession.
However, he does not believe that in the coming years, a person in the position of a lecturer will be completely replaced by technology.
After her, Piotr Nabielec took on the problem of life in times of overloading information, emotional or overloading in the matter of choice, giving the public valuable guidance on how to deal with it, and Lucas Lętocha, in his speech, spoke of what another industrial revolution, known as the "Principal 4.0" might lead to.
Learning fun, learning fun
The conference's organizers also took care of the artistic impressions, inviting the illusionist Daniel Jedinak to the stage.
The third part of the conference opened from Ireneusz Krosny, who first played the public pantonium, and then – for example, on his own career – told us how he was trying to maintain a proper balance between his career on stage and private life.
Szymon Holovnia has also taken his stand, stressing, above all, the role of time in our lives.
The publicist pointed out that even two minutes can change the situation in a diametrical way and need to be ready to use this time.
In addition, Holovnia shared her thoughts on the reality surrounding us, calling for anecdotes that could have caused a smile on the face of the eyes.
Then came Adrian Tworuszka, who reviewed the history and objectives of several innovation models and related them to how they are currently being used.
At the end of Marcin Sloviak, for example, the Rubik, he spoke of an approach to solving problems.
Each of the 11 lecturers has certainly brought something new in view of the reality of all those who had the opportunity to look at the performances and the answers and many questions to the guests with a great commitment from the public.
The organizers provided a broadcast for all who could not personally participate in the event, and the recordings from the lecture are available on the website.
Governments of law instead of governments of law.
"Despite the lack of sufficient number of votes to amend the Constitution, the governing majority introduced a number of changes in the state system, creating threats to the rule of law and the principle of triple power," says the Helsinki Human Rights Foundation, published on Thursday.
The report "The rule of law instead of the rule of law" documents, among other things, changes in the level of justice and in the sphere of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFPC) published a report entitled “Governments of law instead of governments.
Threats to the protection of human rights in Poland from 2015 to 2019".
The Foundation estimates in the report that in 2015-2019, the largest return on human rights in Poland was recorded after 1989.
“Despite the lack of sufficient number of votes to amend the Constitution, the ruling majority introduced a number of amendments to the State system, creating threats to the protection of the rule of law and the principle of triple power.
By adapting the right to political objectives, the rule of law has been replaced by the rule of law," HFPC experts wrote.
What about the HFPC report?
The report documents changes in the functioning of justice, independent institutions (such as the public media or the Ombudsman) and in the field of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including freedom of assembly, women's rights, LGBT people's rights and the right to a fair trial).
The report also summarises a three-year dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union.
"In the last four years for the first time and on such a scale, we have observed the use of the right to exercise the partial interests of the parties.
This has led to an ongoing legal crisis, as well as a weakening of the entire human rights system in Poland," said lawyer Marcin Volny, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of human rights
As indicated in the report, the past four years have been a "systemic period of change both in the State and in the field of human rights".
Over the last four years, Seim has adopted more than 20 key legal acts in terms of human rights protection.
"The changes were often adopted at a rapid pace, without social consultation and despite the legal reservations, the Ombudsman for Citizens' Rights or international organisations," said Lawyer Malgorzat Szuleka, co-author of the report.
According to the report, the main trends observed over the past four years are: “the weakening of independent institutions (including courts and prosecutors), the failure to respect the binding judgments of courts and the recommendations of international institutions and the weakening of the guarantee of the protection of human rights”.
State authorities have not responded
In particular, the Helsinki Foundation for Human Affairs considered "the situations in which State authorities did not react or even considered cases of aggression to be a matter of concern".
The Foundation’s experts noted that some changes have been made in the atmosphere of attacks on individual institutions or professional groups or groups affected by discrimination.
The Foundation indicates that the result of the State's activities in the area of limiting the rule of law is a persistent dispute between the Polish authorities with the European Union and a number of recommendations by international law actors.
"The failure to implement these recommendations not only weakens Poland's position as a leader of democratic change in the Central and Eastern European region, but also exposes the Polish State to its responsibility for violating European Union law or the European Convention on Human Rights," we read in the report.
Brother of Pakistani social media star with life for honour killing
Experts on women's rights say that justice investigations are often difficult due to prolonged proceedings, the release of suspected murderers for bail and the public awareness of cases.
"It takes so long for people to forget," says Farzana Bari, the defender of women's rights and the founder of the first gender study department in Pakistan at the university, and adds that even the widespread murder of Baloch has been resolved for more than three years.
Although, according to the Women's Rights Fighting Group, reliable data are difficult to establish, the Pakistani Human Rights Commission identified at least 300 cases of so-called honour killings in 2018.
Many activists claim that the real number is much higher, and the network promoting awareness of honour crimes estimates that there are about one fifth of the 5,000 honour killings in Pakistan worldwide every year.
Polack's record earnings abroad
However, transfers to the country are small, because many immigrants are staying outside Poland permanently – the "Rzeczpospolita" is given Friday.
The latest Euro-Tax report shows that Poland’s average earnings in other European countries amounted to more than 8.6 thousand dollars in 2018, which means that they have grown by almost a thousand gold, or almost 12%.
Euro-Tax "believes that the total income of Polish migrant workers in the Union reached a record value of 154.5 billion dollars in 2018, with one seventh more than a year earlier", we read.
Director of the Centre for Migration of the University of Warsaw, Paweł Kaczmarczyk, says that Poland is increasingly working on the international labour market, where they use various available options.
"The number of specialists and professionals who move from country to country in search of ever better conditions, like international corporate workers," the newspaper reports.
Some Euro-Tax customers work in two countries during the year, such as the United Kingdom and Germany.
“This is the largest in the RFN in 2018 because 11% of total earnings of Polish immigrants (up to about 27 billion dollars).
However, the Polish made the most of it on the island – almost 35 billion evils," we read on.
The President of the Euro-Taxu believes that despite the improvement of working conditions in the Polish market, the number of migrant workers does not decrease.
I continue to see that the Western and Northern European countries (in front of Norway) are often a chance for several times higher earnings than in Poland.
"It is even at minimum rates in a given country, which, for example, in Germany is €9.5-11.7 per hour," the newspaper reports.
"Rzeczpospolita" suggests that the Polish stay not only because of higher wages, but also because they are abroad.
Many Poles leave behind a border of roots, which is also seen after small transfers of money to the country.
Those last year were the lowest of years.
According to economist Tadeusz Christiani, along with the extension of the stay abroad, a small group of people sending money to the country and reducing their heights.
"Emigrants draw close," we read in Friday "Rzeczpospolitj".
Prolonged monsoons cause floods and chaos in many regions of India
The monsoon season in India has been extending for almost a month, and unaffected rainfalls cause death due to the drying of buildings and the hummingbirds.
Usually in the northern Indian monsoons stop in early September, but the average rainfall this month exceeded the standard by 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Department, if this situation continues for the next few days, it will be the late end of the monsoon decade.
In many areas of the country, rainfalls are still unaffected – recently in western India, the cities of Pune and rainforests have led to the death of dozens of people and the collapse of buildings.
There's been a flooding of houses, people crawling through the streets in the water on their knees, which usually only takes place during the apogeum monsoon.
Heavy rains also occurred in cities such as Calcutta, Luknow and Hajdarabad.
As a result of the long-lasting rains in the northern state of Uttarakhand, many homes were destroyed.
Monsun also started late.
In many areas there was no water, so the farmers prepared for the likely drought.
The long-lasting monsoon is not well seen by farmers.
That amount of rain is not normal for this year.
"Through it my vegetables – and now I have a hat, beans, mushrooms and tomatoes – will rot," says Prakash Mehra, a farmer from a small farm in Bhimtal in Uttarakhand state.
For consumers, the late effects and the late end of the monsoon mean a rise in the price of onions, i.e. the unrecognizable ingredient of Indian foods.
The Cebula, which usually had to pay 20 rupees (0.23 pounds of British), currently costs 80 rupees (approximately 1 pounds of British) per kilograms in cities such as Delhi and Bombay.
Feasts and holidays are also at risk.
Another great festival is the 8th October of the St. Dasar, where the Hindus raise huge beads as from a comic, representing Ravena, the character of the horn and the evil smile of the "Ramajana" epoch.
Ravan's burning symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.
However, taking into account that similar Ravens were made out of paper, if the monsoon continues to last, it's exactly Ravana's last laugh.
Implementation of the Energysynergia Technology Sp. z o.o. for restructuring

The same ownership of these shares went to INDOS S.A. with its headquarters in Chorzow.

Doodle celebrates 21 Google birthdays
It would be hard to imagine a world without Google today.
In the search engine, we're looking for answers to all the questions we're asking.
What are we looking for in Google?
"What is it?", "Where?", "How?" and "How?" are one of the favorite categories sought by Polish.
The giant data shows that last year we were willing to ask, among other things, "Where's the burza?", "How to make sparrows?" and "How many fingers has a horse?", "How to get rid of the fruit muscle?", "How to eat kaki?".
Today, the search engine is about the twenty-first birthday.
Its users – and up to 96% of people in Poland use Google Uncle – welcome to the special Google Doodle today.
It's not animated this time.
Google recalls its births, showing a stationary computer with a monitor, mouse and keyboard, and in the right, bottom corner, a digital date was printed – as on a picture from the year 90.
Information catalogue
The search engine was created for a specific purpose – to catalogue all possible information and make it available via the Internet.
Her name is a word game.
It comes from the mathematical term google, meaning the number of ten raised to the power of a hundred.
This title was also intended to reflect the company's intention to index as many parties from global Internet resources as possible.
Google's search engine was founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1996 as part of their student project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the relationship between the parties, which worked better than the usual segregation methods based on the frequency of the phrase.
At the beginning of the search engine was named BlackRub, which refers to the English word blacklink, which means the number of pages referring to the result.
Page and Brin established a company operating under Google Inc. on September 7, 1998, and soon launched the famous website google.com today.
What's next, Google?
In December 1998, information on the extremely high frequency of Google search results appears in the PC Magazine.
Then the company's history looks almost like a fairy tale - a brilliant development with every month, a subversive of other markets and an increase in the value of the company.
Already in June 2000, the Google URL index has over billions of locations, making Page and Brina the world's largest Internet search engine.
Currently, the company founded by Page and Brina is one of the leading players on the IT market.
So is there another field for development?
"The Google mission is an organization of global information resources to be widely available and useful, although we have made huge progress in this area, it is still a long way to achieve this goal," said Piotr Zalewski from Google Poland in a conversation with "Newsweek".
Common contact with pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke
The new study suggests that exposure to plant protection products at high levels may result in a high risk of heart failure in later years.
This was the case for a group of Japanese-born Americans in Hawaii, who had been studied for more than 30 years.
Scientists found that compared to men who did not work with plant protection products, those who had the highest contact with them were 45% more affected by heart disease or stroke.
"This study underlines the need to use personal protective equipment during contact with pesticides at work and the importance of recording in medical documentation contact with such agents at work, as well as to monitor standard factors that increase the risk of heart disease," said Dr. Beatriz Rodriguez co-author.
She's a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii in the Manoa district.
The results are based on data from more than 6,000 men on the island of Oahu who participated in the Kukini Honolulu cardiology program.
As scientists have pointed out, the results of the study may not apply to women and other populations because it was only for men of Japanese origin.
Pesticides have a long half-life, so their effects on health may be known many years after contact with these substances.
In this case, the most visible results were observed within 10 years after contact with plant protection substances.
In a press release, Rodriguez reported: “After 34 years of male observation, the relationship between exposure to pesticides and heart disease and stroke was no longer significant. ”
It was so likely because more important factors were related to aging that masked possible causal relationships between exposure to pesticides and vulnerability to the disease of the circulation system in later years of life.
Researchers did not detect a significant relationship between exposure to small amounts of moderate plant protection and increased risk of heart disease or stroke.
Phone conversation Zelenski-Trump: Porosenko offers his three coins
The Washington policy has been grueling for a week since the introduction of the impeachment procedure against US President Donald Trump.
Getting used to the political scandal is for the political debate of Wolodymir Greene's situation, which he would like to avoid.
But what do we really know about the Green-Trump affair, and will it have far-reaching effects for the first one?
Nearly at the start of Trump's phone call, the United States declared to Greenland that it is doing more for Ukraine than European countries.
Despite the fact that the notes disclosed by the White House are not complete, the Trump attack on the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, is described in detail as being that the German leader, along with other leaders of European countries, engages in negotiations instead of presenting concrete proposals.
The controversy sparked a Green response that announced that Trump was not 100%, but 1000%.
Zelenski added that both French President Macron and Merkel are insufficiently trying to help Ukraine.
This exchange of views led politicians, in particular from the Ukrainian opposition, to decide to vote through social services.
Peter Porosenko, former President of Ukraine, stated on Twitter that the EU's support was "without precedent".
In other tweets, Porosenko said he was grateful for the EU's support during the "Russian aggression" that included sanctions and financial assistance.
Others expressed their concerns, including Ukrainian politicians Victoria Voytsitska announced: "How can we talk to Germany and France now?"
Then Trump referred to military aid and asked Zełenski for investigation not in one and two cases: the first concerning the son of Joe Biden – Hunter – and the second concerning the entry into the DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in a hacker attack on the Democratic e-mail boxes during the 2016 elections.
It is not known whether it describes these European relations, or whether they will result in relations with the leader of France and Germany being broken.
I don't want to talk bad about anybody...
Thank you for all the help we can offer" – he announced after publishing a telephone interview with Zelenski in New York during the UN General Assembly.
Zelenski is to meet the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the upcoming summit of "Nordic Squares", which will take place in October.
Former District Inspector Legally Detained
The court has cleared Jerzy Visnievsky of his crimes.
After six years Jerzy Wiszniewski was finally cleared of the charges.
The District Court of Commerce cleared Jerzy Wisnijewski, the former head of the Trade Quality Inspectorate of Roll-Food Products in Rzeszow, on the charge of a breach of the powers.
The Lubela prosecutor accused him of betraying the former Marshallese voivodeship of the time limit of control in the food-producing oil plant.
He has recently come to the conclusion that it is a legitimate ruling to do so.
The appeal was recognized on 12 September.
"The Court maintained the judgment of the defendant," confirmed Judge Malgorzata Reiser, spokesman for the Chamber of the District Court of Commerce.
It is a judgment of 14 February issued by the Regional Court of Justice in the Ministry of Justice.
Jerzy Wisnijewski then commented on Facebook: “It was six years since I was presented by the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Lublin with the alleged violation of the law in a telephone interview with the Mayor of Podkarpacki on April 30, 2012.
The court has clearly stated that I am innocent and that I did not break the existing law.
I was convinced that my phone conversation with the Marshall of Podkarpacki was in line with the existing law.
The version of the events published by the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Lublin in 2013 was true and caused irreversible harm both to the food producer’s entrepreneurs and to the loss of my personal image among my employers, employees and local communities.
The indictment filed against me in the Court’s opinion contained a number of errors, false facts, inconsistencies of legal basis, not confirmed in reality.
With the help of CBA in Rzeszow, everything was done to eliminate me from public and professional life.
I was immediately released from work and my financial resources were cut short.
I've left a long time to keep my wife."
Let's remember.
Jerzy Wisnijewski served as a voodoo quality trade inspector for agricultural and food products between 2009 and 2013.
He was summoned from office after his charges were filed by the Public Prosecutor in Lublin in 2013.
According to the following, he had to betray the former Marshallese voivodship in a telephone conversation (Mirosław Karapyta was sentenced to 4 years of freedom) the time limit for the control of the oil producing plant which belongs to the wife of the former Vice-President of the sub-carpack.
This warning – as prosecutors from Lublin claimed – was to cause the company's owner to know about the controls and correct labels on the oils that were incomplete.
Jerzy Wiszniewski heard the charges of overcrowding, which threatened him to lose his freedom within three years.
"I feel relieved that this case has finally been brought to an end and the court has confirmed my innocence.
From the beginning, I was convinced that I did not do anything wrong, which is now the final confirmation of a legitimate sentence depriving me of my charges," said Jerzy Wisnijewski.
The White House was trying to hide the conversation with Zelenski
In a Thursday edited report, the signaler wrote that President Donald Trump, speaking with Ukraine's President Wolodymyr Zelenski, had been infiltrating the country in the U.S. election, and the White House was trying to hide the record of this conversation.
The Presidents of Ukraine and the United States
In an anonymous report dated August 12, which is probably an intelligence officer, he wrote: “In my duties I was informed by many members of the American government that the president used his role to demand foreign interference in the 2020 election in the United States”.
‘Trump used part of the conversation (with the Greens) to realize its own interests.
And exactly – he tried to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take steps that would help the president in the election in 2020," the report quoted by The Hill.
The leader of Ukraine is "given to understand" that contact with Trump depends on whether "it will show the will to take the game" in matters about which President Rudy Giuliani's lawyer had to inform him more precisely.
The author admits that he was not a witness to the conversation, but stresses that he was informed in detail about its contents by "many White House officials who had direct information on this matter", and their relations were covered.
"The following days after this discussion, I learned from many American officials that high levels of White House representatives have intervened to "stop" all archived records of this conversation, and in particular the verbal record that has been prepared, as is usually done, in the crisis room of the White House," we read on.
"The high ranking of White House officials told me that White House lawyers "commanded them to remove the electronic record from the computer system in which such records are stored.
It has been transferred to a separate electronic system, which is usually used to store and manipulate information in particular," wrote the author.
"In my assessment, these steps show that the White House officials were aware of the importance of what happened during the conversation," the signalist assessed.
As the AP has commented, this document will probably speed up the proceedings on the President's possible impeachment and also contain valuable information on witnesses who can confirm this relationship.
After pressuring the Congress, he made a presentation with the Green White House, but not on the basis of an electronic record, but on the basis of the relationship of the people who witnessed it.
The content of the report, in an edited version, was published the following day by the Committee of the Representatives.
Also on Thursday, the responsible director of the US intelligence, Joseph Maguire, testified before the Committee of Inquiry of the House of Representatives and explained how he had dealt with the intelligence employee's report.
Maguire said that the signaler made the right choice and did the right thing.
He also stressed that, in his view, the conversation with the Greens was an event "without precedent".
The democracies in the committee of inquiry asked Maguire why he blocked the release of the Congress' report by the signaler; the director of the investigation refused that he had no right to disclose his content, which is a secret guarantee by the so-called privileged executive authority.
The part of Maguire's hearing by the Commission was held behind closed doors.
On Tuesday, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, informed that, due to the suspicion that the President had put pressure on the Ukrainian authorities to harm his potential rival in the next presidential elections, the House of Representatives launched an investigation that could lead to the impeachment of Trump.
The day later, she found that the report of Trump's talks with the Greens confirmed that the president of the United States had broken the rules on elections and security.
Election law in the United States prohibits the use of foreign aid.
However, the justice resort assessed that the president did not break the electoral law. On Thursday, the spokesperson of the White House, Stephanie Grisham, said that there was "nothing wrong" in the conversation, and in the report "there is nothing more than a third-hand relationship and shared press releases".
"The White House will continue to criticise this history of the media and the false narrative promoted by the mainstream media," she added.
Ghana receives two ICAO awards
Ghana won two prestigious awards during the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) meeting in Montreal, Canada.
The security award was awarded in proof that Ghana has achieved the highest number of points in Africa in the aviation security surveillance, i.e. 89.89 per cent in the area of the provisional rate of effective implementation (EI).
This occurred when ICAO completed its ICVM control on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the UN Aviation Agency’s General Audit Programme.
The protection award was evidence of a high level of country involvement in the implementation of ICAO recommended standards and protection protocols at airports and in Ghana's airspace.
The programme was designed to support the ICAO initiative No.
In addition, ICAO Member States, which have improved their safety and safety standards, have been granted 16 other safety certificates and 17 safety certificates.
At the time of the award for Ghana, he was Minister of Aviation, Joseph Kofi Adda, Director General of Ghana Civil Aviation Office, Simon Allotey, Ambassador of Ghana in Canada, No Ayikoi Otoo and Managing Director of Ghana Airport Company Limited, Yaw Kwakwa.
In his speech, the President of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, Olumuyiva Benard Aliu, stressed the need for Member States to maintain aviation security.
He said that it is important for us to keep in mind that even in the time of innovation, the security of aviation protection and sustainable development must remain our fundamental priorities.
Mr Adda noted that the awards were a huge achievement for the state's efforts because they complement hard work and industry endurance.
He added that the aviation industry has enormous potential for the development of the country's economy, saying "aircraft has the potential to change our lives.
These are socio-economic benefits, but everything comes from the security and protection we have managed to achieve."

The owners of the gas station estimated losses of nearly 1 thousand dollars.
Owner of a stolen bike – 2 thousand zł.
On last Tuesday, one of the foreign districts noticed on the island of Vyszyński, whose owner was suspected of theft.
He was just looking for a 50-year-old.
The man was arrested in police custody.
On Thursday, he heard charges of fuel theft from 4 gas stations and a bike.
He confessed to committing these crimes.

Trump nominates Peter Gaynor as Head of FEMA: White House
Peter Gaynor, acting as the Administrator of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA), smiles at the meeting of the Senate National Security Budgetary Sub-Commission on the proposal of the FEMA for the financial year 2020 at the Capitol Summit in Washington, U.S.A., on 3 April 2019.
WASZYNGTON (Reuters) – The White House announced that on Thursday US President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gaynor as head of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA).
Gaynor, the Deputy Administrator of FEMA, is the head of the agency that oversees the government response to disasters such as hurricanes or forest fires.
The agency worked without an administrator approved by the US Senate since March when Brock Long fired that position.
Long resigned after the United States Department of National Security under FEMA found that Long improperly used government vehicles to travel between Washington and his home in the North Carolina.
Another candidate for this position, Jeffrey Byard, was removed earlier this month when his exact examination of his past revealed the charges that he had taken part in the fight at the bar.
Gaynor's appointment was expected.
In order to confirm his appointment to this role, the majority of the Senate will be required.
The White House announced that before becoming the Deputy Administrator of FEMA in 2018, Gaynor worked in crisis management in Rhode Island and served in the seabed.
Henrik Ingebrigtsen, Norwegian runner, considering amputation of the thumb
The 28-year-old runner specializes in the distance of 1500 meters, winning the gold medal of the European Championships in 2012 (Helsinki), silver in 2014 (Zurich) and brown in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also a European champion for 5,000 metres from 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that it was not a new concern and that one operation had already passed immediately after the games in 2016, but the pain returned and the current season was very violent.
Pain causes me to put a different footing, which changes my body’s order, causes other unnatural burdens, and begins to feel pain in other places, such as biodegradation.
That's why I couldn't prepare enough for the world's championships, and for two weeks the pain has been so strong that I have difficulty putting the wheels – the runner said on the NRK TV channel.
The father and coach of the Žert Ingebrigtsen, who, after long discussions with his son, admitted that the only solution was not to end his career and participate in future Olympics in Tokyo, will be amputation.
It looks like it's the only one, although the drastic solution and the decision has already come down.
"If a part of the body hurts, it should be removed, and in total Henrik does not need this finger so much and in this situation it should be forgotten about the cosmetic aspect," he explained.
Police close illegal e-paper factory with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley – CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) – On Thursday the police closed the illegal e-paper factory with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley.
At the office building standing on the 9600 Telstar Avenue about 16:37 there was a raid, where the police were looking for illegal products for the sale of e-papers containing marijuana and where large layers of butane hash oil were found, a concentrate of Indian mushrooms.
According to Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police, the officers also found a device that was used to supplement the combustion contributions.
"This process is very dangerous," says Cano.
Cano, who used to work with drugs, says that distillation of oil used in steaming products is a potentially easy process.
"A normal electrostatic spark of our clothes can cause the fire of these strains, causing not only fire, but also explosions," he says.
“If we have many layers and similar in the room, after one explosion there will be another, causing not only fire, but also explosions that could take away the entire complex from the surface.
A task force was called to the office to deal with illegal and potentially dangerous substances.
Currently, the value of confiscated products and equipment is unknown.
The detectives say that they received an anonymous guide that allowed them to obtain a search warrant, which led to the discovery of illegal activity.
The investigators are still trying to get information about who's behind this illegal business.
According to them, the responsible person took an interest in this place because the office was empty.
The investigation is ongoing, and officials want to be sure that illegal products have not reached the street, taking into account recent articles on the dangers of smoking.
"People don't really know what products they buy," says Cano.
‘They may be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This may pose a threat to our society and children, so we always keep them from reaching for this kind of thing.
Aphtin removed from the market.
GIF has taken over the medicine and the medicine for blisters
The Chief Inspector of Pharmaceuticals informed of the withdrawal of the medicinal product from the market for oral infections.
Aphtin is a medicine that is used to treat measles and mucous membrane infections of the mouth, infections with Gram-additional bacteria.
It can also be used to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The product was withdrawn because it did not comply with the requirements for the specification of the quality smell of the product and the decrease in the content of the active substance.
The product was withdrawn at the request of the Galenium Laboratory in Olsztina.
Each month the GIF shall issue on average several decisions to withdraw the individual series of products from the market.
A series of medicinal products held in circulation in Poland may be re-introduced to the market after evidence of safety has been submitted.
In case of withdrawal, there is no such possibility.
Banknote 19 zł – where to buy a collection banknote about this nominal?
He's wearing 19 gold and he's wearing a picture of Ignac Jan Padrewski.
A new collection note will be introduced in early October – the National Bank of Poland informed.
This is another note from the series "Indemnity".
It is intended to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the creation of the Polish Securities Manufacturer.
As stated in the NBP Communication, Ignacy Jan Padrewski will be presented on the banknote.
Date placed on the banknote, 25 January 2019, is the day on which the 100th anniversary of the establishment of PWPW belongs.
Also the nominal value, 19 zł, refers to the Year of Creation" - we read in the NBP Communication.
The watermark presents an eagle image from the first Polish banknote produced in PWPW after recovery of independence.
The novelty is a holographic tape located on the floor of the window.
The front page presents the portrait of Ignace Jan Padrewski, and a picture of Orla Biało's order was presented in addition to the inscription "not subject".
This inscription, reflected in the manuscript by Józef Pilsudski, is a 100-year-old trade logo recovered by Poland's independence.
In the coat of arms, symbolizing fraternity and victory, the security developed by PWPW - Umbra4Note, which is a special form of angle effect, was composed.
On the side of the reverse banknote, a gmama image is placed on the background of the panoramas of modern Warsaw.
Next to it is built into the PWPW logo, the SPARC Live security and the opalizing bar, also visible in UV in the form of repeated numbers "19" and the "NBP" shortcut - describes NBP.
The banknote is due to go into circulation on October 2nd to load up to 55,000 pieces.
One note will cost 80 gold.
All currencies and banknotes issued by NBP, including those in special series, are the legal means of payment in Poland.
However, their nominal value is significantly higher than that which can be achieved on the collection market.
The new owner bought it for 500 thousand dollars, more than two million gold, for his parents and decided to move the building to Queenstown in Maryland.
The house was transferred on a special platform to Easton port where it was loaded on a boat.
That's where the river's 50 miles away.
Jarosław Kaczyński vote on the Gosievska Malgorzata
President of PiS Jarosław Kaczyński, in the upcoming elections, will vote in the Gosijowska Malgorzata.
"Please do the same," he appealed.
Jarosław Kaczyński and Malgorzat Gosiewska have taken pictures of the flag candidate PiS.
On Friday, the Warsaw "three" was praised in the social media that it is receiving Kaczyn's vote in the parliamentary elections.
"The Prime Minister of Law and Justice Jarosław Kaczyński supports Malgorzata Gosiewska," we read on her Facebook profile.
The party leader pointed out that he was a sensitive, sensitive person and was always ready to help.
"I will give my vote to the Mågorzat Gosiewska and please do the same," he appealed.
Gosijowska is running for Sejm from district 19. (Warszawa) and third place on the list.
"One" is Kaczyński itself, and Mariusz Kaminski takes the second place.
They're going to find the bookstores.
Before we meet with popular writers and books at exceptional prices.
"We're here to break stereotypes.
The inhabitants of Podcarpacia are said to be not reading books.
We'll show it's different," she said at a press conference in Marta Halftorak.
And who will support reading in Rzeszow this year?
As we have heard, Sister Anastasia, the first chef of the Rzečípospolit, will appear on the markets, as well as: Lukasz Orbitowski, Katarzyna Bonda, Karolina Korwin-Piotrowska and Jakub Čwiek.
This autumn in the Millennium Hall will be a great cultural event – November 22 and 23 to the shopping center, the 3rd edition of the Christmas Book Markets, one of the most important reading events in the region.
The most interesting publishers and bookmakers from all over Poland come to the market.
There will be 30 of them, and among them there will be Ara, Mark, SQN, PWN and Black.
In their positions, they present their wide range of publishing offers and hundreds of book news that market participants will be able to buy at attractive prices.
More than that, special meetings with the writers will be held within two days of the auction.
This time, authors were invited to write about important matters and are not afraid to take on difficult subjects, and are also award winners and... well prepared.
The list of invited authors is not yet closed.
At this time, the participation in the markets was confirmed, among other things, by Lukasz Orbitowski – the winner of the policy passport, Janusz Leon Wiszniewski, the best-selling author of "Networking Alone", and the king of the Polish crime: Katarzyna Bonda.
The star of this year's markets will be Anastasia's sister, author of several hundred books (including cooks), who sold more than 4 million copies.
Exhibition of Lost Dress Elżbiety I in the Hampton Court Palace
The silver thread made of the most important silky camel has been artificially decorated with the hooks representing vegetation, animals and motils.
For Eleri Lynn, curator of the Historic Royal Palaces Foundation, this meant only one thing.
The delicacy of the cloth hanging from 100 years on the wall of the small village church that she looked at could only be lost by the part of Elizabeth I's wardrobe.
Three years after Lynn came across the case of an exhibition of altar cloth in Bacton in Herefordshire County, the missing Elżbiety dress is due to meet her next month at the Hampton Court Palace, near the same premises where the Queen of the Tudor dynasty could carry her more than 450 years ago.
The extent of this discovery is that from the entire collection of royal dress only one element of the XVI-age dress survived.
Although there is no overwhelming evidence that Elizabeth ever wore this dress, three years of research have strengthened the experts to believe that she must have been part of the royal wardrobe.
"Srebroglav" was legally reserved only for the most important members of the royal court, and the virtuoso quality of dried plants and flowers, later enriched with deer, dogs, mottles, fish and bears, indicates that the cover was one of the most important of the people.
The dress, when it was heard, could cost the equivalent of Tudor's possession.
“In the 1990s, at the end of Elizabeth’s reign, she felt the threat from other women in the court and would not tolerate rivals wearing such durable fabrics,” says Lynn.
"As this is a very important statement, I have asked many people from the environment to look at the dresses.
I was really glad to see the dress, and they also admired it, and they were practically convinced that we had a part of the royal wardrobe in front of us.
Long, relived dress, trimmed to serve as an altar cloth in the dark church of St. Faith in Bacton, is not as unexpected as it might seem.
Bacton is a settlement from which Blanche Parry, the nearest Elżbiete lady of the court, has been serving the queen for her entire life and with which in the local legends she has been identified with the matter of fabric.
Although the dress was born after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth had to give it to the Parry family or to the parishioners to remember Blanche before her death in 1603.
After more than a thousand hours of conservation work, four of which flowed on the most delicate hand-circuit using specially colored soap and heavy surgical needles, the altar cloth hit the exhibition next to the exhibition's Hatfield House portrait "Rainbow Portrait", one of the most famous paintings of the present-day Elżbieta dressed in a similar dress.
"Working with historical fabrics really begins to respect the art of the people who did it," says Libby Thompson, head of conservation work, whose most of it was done in the glass fields in the Hampton Court Palace – the only place large enough to accommodate some of the priceless palace gobelins.
“Looking back and forth, I began to feel immense respect for those who made it.
I've never worked on anything so elite.
The exhibition "The Lost Dress of Elizabeth" will begin on 12 October in the Hampton Court Palace
Fitch Agency confirmed Poland's rating with a stable perspective
The Fitch agency confirmed Poland’s long-term rating in foreign currency on Friday at the level of “A-” – given in the communication.
The perspective of the rating remained stable.
"The Fitch Agency points to strong macroeconomic and well-diversified economies that are supported by sound economic policies and a strong banking sector," we read in the Communication of the Ministry of Finance.
As added, Fitch pointed out that Poland was at the end of the economic cycle, and in 2019-2021 the real growth rate of the Gross National Product in Poland will be 4.1 per cent, 3.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent respectively.
The Agency predicts that the government and self-government deficit for GDP in 2020-2021 will remain below 3%, 2.3% and 1.9% respectively.
"The government and government debt ratio to GDP in 2019 will be 50.5 per cent according to the agency, and in subsequent years it will be smaller (average 48.3 per cent over the period 2020-2021)", we read.
Rating Polish
The autumn round of Polish rating reviews will end on October 11th S&P and Moody's.
The rating of Poland in Fitch's assessment remains the same as it was issued at the end of March 2019.
At that time, the agency confirmed Poland's rating at the level of "A-" with a stable perspective.
Among the three largest credit rating agencies, Poland assesses Moody's creditworthiness at A2 level.
According to Fitch and S&P, rating Poland is "A-", one level lower than Moody's.
The prospects of all assessments are stable.
What's a rating?
The credit rating agencies are set up to assist investors in assessing the risk scale of their investment activities.
The rating is granted to companies, banks and states.
In the latter case, each assessment shall be translated into economic attractiveness.
Rating is nothing but a credit rating.
It is based on decisions about who and how much to borrow money.
Sometimes this information also suggests that it is best not to give any credit at all because there is a great risk that money will not be recovered.
The lower rating is associated with a higher risk.
In turn, higher risk is a high percentage of credit.
Any assessment must be justified and legitimized.
The rating can be manipulated, but in this case, the agencies risk losing their reputation.
At the moment, more than 90 per cent of the world market for rating services are controlled by three agencies: Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each of them uses its own system of assessments.
Five of the Confederations: after the first 1000 plus
"Fifth of the Confederation", that is, the main foundations of the electoral programme, were presented on Friday in Koszalina to the Sejm district 40 candidates for a mandate from the KW Confederation Freedom and Independence list.
The leader of the Koszalinian letter to Sejm Krzysztof Chmielewski presented the words "five confederations".
"After the first 1000 plus programme for Poland, after the second fast and fair courts, after the third cultural and educational bonus, after the fourth national security, after the fifth, this is a healthy life," Chmielewski said.
He noted that "polices have to start making a good start," so the Confederation wants to eliminate the income tax and, as Chmielewski said, "the problem with the tax-free amount itself will be solved".
"The Polacks need to make a choice where they want to save their money for retirement, that is, zero PIT and Voluntary ZUS for all," said the list's leader on the "1000 Plus Programme for Poland" assumptions.
On the other hand, Alexander Zadencka, starting from the second place of the list, said that "life is increasingly worse" and to change this, "support Polish farmers, Polish agriculture" should work for the cultivation of GMOs.
As she said, the Confederation also refers to the cessation of the "stigmatization of seed mushrooms".
Zadencka declared its support for the "development of a building using natural raw materials".
She also spoke on behalf of her group for "Vaccinations of Goods".
"The right to an informed consent cannot be violated," she added.
The other candidates for the Sejm from the Koszalin district stressed that the Confederation was "to carry out a profound reform of the judiciary", which would include, among other things, the trial by the judge "day after day".
They also claimed that the education grant would be given to schools without the help of government, that is,, according to them, without additional costs related to the maintenance of officials.
The Confederation is also a "strong Polish army based on Polish industry and Polish soldiers".
The Sejm candidates stressed the need to increase the army.
According to them, there is also a need for easier access to weapons.
In economic matters, they stressed the need for "permanent access to energy".
"We can fire coal, we have a lot of geothermal energy, we also need to consider the return to the concept of nuclear power," said the fifth on the election list Piotr Karpinski.
The head of the Mexican cartel is behind one third of the drugs in the United States.
Chicago – just after sunrise on the West Side in Chicago CBS News reported an early drug attack.
Brian McKnight of the Office for Drug Control (DEA) in full light showed what's going on.
Last year in Chicago, nearly 800 people died from drug overdose.
McKnight said "probably 90%" of drugs in Chicago come from Mexico.
The DEA focuses on the Mexican drug lord Nemesio Cervantesie, known as El Mencho.
"This is the most important priority for the DEA and directly for federal executives in the United States," said Matthew Donahue, chief DEA agent in Mexico.
The reward for El Mencho is $10 million.
He helped discover dozens of El Mencho drug labs in the jungle.
A member of El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generation, CJNG, is responsible for at least one third of the drugs that affect the US on land and sea.
According to the Justice Department, the cartel has mixed "tonnes" of cocaine, methamphetamines and heroin contaminated with fentanyl.
El Mencho's head is waiting for a $10 million reward.
As ironically, he lived in California about 30 years ago, where he was arrested for drug-related charges and eventually deported to Mexico.
That's where he created a brutal cartel.
It has a huge amount of weapons, RPG, a 50-caliber weapon.
It basically has its own SWAT teams," Donahue added.
El Mencho protects his empire by using such measures as shooting a Mexican army helicopter, killing six people, or participating in public hanging this year.
In recent years, the brutality of the cartel has led to thousands of murders.
According to the Mexican government's statistics, about 94 murders come every day.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic that they can't be dealt with without protective equipment.
In the cocaine pack laboratory, it means the mark of the transverseer.
For more than one third of them, the trail leads to the El Mencho cartel.
"He is responsible for sending a poison that kills innocent women and children," said Donahue.
So when a child dies, Donahue believes there is a "great chance" that drugs come from the organisation of El Mencho.
Last year, more than 67,000 Americans died from overdose.
France: 27 years old blackmailed French president and his wife
A 27-year-old man tried to blackmail Emmanuel Macron and the first lady – says the French prosecutor.
The accused shall ensure that he has documents compromising the presidential couple.
He asked the head of state, among other things, 300 thousand euros in cash.
The man who was born in Azerbaijan and wanted to work in France in the police says he received "explosive" documents from the person employed in the Elise Palace.
During the hearings, he explained that these documents not only compromise the presidential couple, but their disclosure can only threaten the security of Macron and the first lady of France.
In exchange for their return, he demanded 300 thousand euros – he also wanted to get an apartment in Paris.
He contacted one of Brigitte Macron's daughters in the previous marriage.
According to the prosecutor, he refused to report the documents he was talking about to the police.
He said he would pass them through – but at the moment it is unknown whether these documents really exist.
They weren't found during the audit at this 27-year-old's apartment.
The man was subjected to psychiatric tests, but the doctors did not find any serious disorders in him.
PS4 game will be old school – Sony's amazing facts about PlayStation 4
Sony sheds more light on the soon-beginning game available only on PS4 The Last of Us: Part Two.
Sony at the recent State of Play presentation announced that the prime minister of the Sequela The Last of Us will take place in February 2020.
Fani could also see a new breath-resistant fragment in the chest playing from the next action game.
More concretes appeared in the days after the loud premiere of the play The Last of Us 2.
And it looks like Sony and Naughty Dog are reaching out for high school climates in many ways.
Decided for something we haven't seen since the times of PS 1. The Last of Us: Part 2 will be sold on several plates.
Neil Druckmann from Naughty Dog confirmed this in a revolving interview with The Telegraph, explaining that the sequel has grown into one of the most extensive games in history.
"The plant is ambitious and has turned around in aspects where it was not the only one," he said.
She had to be so extensive that she could present this kind of story with all sorts of characters.
We didn't mean to create the biggest game, so it just happened.
“We are excited about how many possibilities are hidden in this story. There will be a moment when you think you’re going to the end, but you’ll realize that it’s just the beginning and that a completely new chapter is beginning,” says Druckmann.
It's such an ambitious game that she doesn't fit into one BluRay and she's on two plates.
In another place it has been revealed that The Last of Us: Part Two contains one or two eggi of content for adults (information provided by Gamestpot).
We won't be pranking surprises, but appearing in the East Eggi game they're calling for the old school works of Naughty Dog.
Learn more when The Last of Us: Part Two will debut on 21 February 2020 only on PS4.
People with PS4 can prepare for the sequel premiere, reaching for The Last of Us Remastered available in the PS Plus offer.
Sony recently announced a free PS4 playlist offered since October 2019 by PlayStation Plus, among which is the above-mentioned Naughty Dog production.
PS Plus subscribers will also have access to the MLB The Show 19.
If you like The Last of Us Remastered and you want to make a pre-premier order for sequel, Sony said that there will be a lot of versions of the game, including an exclusive edition containing a replica of Ella's back and her bracelets and a 30-centimeter figure of this cult shape.
Run, scrap and fight - Sport
On Saturday, Stomil will take Podbeskide and will win.
Stomila's dancers from three colleagues are unscrupulous.
At that time, the underprivileged Peter Zjozkowski won seven points because they won with Stalla Mielec and Chojniczanka Chojnice, and in the last match, a free regis in Suwałak.
Now the Olstyn team will take Podbeskide on Saturday at 6:00 p.m., which is listed as one of the favorites to advance to the Extraclass.
The closest Stomila rivals occupy the fourth place in the table and have the advantage over the Olsztina team.
The podbeskid on the trips in this season played six times and counted after two victories, remissions and defeats Attomast Stomil feels very good at his facility – at the stadium near the Al. Pilsudska 69a Peter Zązozkowski team won three times and lost once.
Together, in ten rows, the oscillating has gathered 17 points and are in the head of the table, although after two failures at the beginning of the game did not say anything.
"Any changes need time to be results," explains Piotr Skiba.
"Well, finally, we got a little bit busy, we believed in ourselves, and we could work under normal conditions.
We just got together in a ball game.
They're clean heads, they're a good atmosphere and everyone knows what to do because we have a strong training staff."
On Tuesday, Stomila’s footballer was eliminated from the Polish Croat Movement, but they needed to do it as well as a series of criminal shootings.
In southern Poland, Piotr Skiba, Grzegorz Lech and Janusz Bucholc did not leave because coach Ządozkowski had given these key racers a break before Saturday with Podbeskid.
On the other hand, in Chorzow, he played back after the contusion of Jakub Mosakowski, who finally shot his long-awaited gate.
“It’s always fun to get a goal, and I got it at a time so that we can continue to play drums (Moscow was equal to 3:3 in 119 minutes – reg.).
My father often bit me and laughed that I couldn't get the gates, and I always told him I'd shoot at a time when he wouldn't expect to."
Now, Moscow counts back to the basic composition, more than because of the yellow cards can't play Oleh Tarasenko.
"After that, I'm going through a lot of training so I can play first," says Mosakowski.
“I did everything I could to present myself to the best of the audience in Chorzow.
However, whether I'm gonna play or sit on the spare benches, I'm gonna be the same strong support team.
Because the most important is the team and three points in the game with Podbeskide.
We are sure to have a difficult meeting, in which the victory will have to run, scatter and fight."
In the middle of the Olsztian defense, Rafał Remish can still play, who has recently also become angry, so we will find out only Saturday, more than Coach Ządozkowski traditionally tries to keep himself secret until the end of the strike.
The man raped and murdered his sister.
"You will never see the light of the day.
You'll never breathe fresh air again," said Judge Kevin K. Allen, returning to Alex Whipple.
"What you did was so reprehensible and dirty that you had to spend the rest of your life in prison," he added.
Five-year-old Lizzie disappeared in May.
Her search lasted five days, until Whipple pointed out where the body was hiding.
"How could anyone do that to their own sister?" asked Dejay Smith, a girl's uncle.
"You are the worst person humanity has to offer," Alexa Whipple told.
"I would give up everything to meet her again, hug her," said the murdered girl's mother.
"Our life will never be the same again," added the contrite woman.
As Fox News reports, 22-year-old Whipple didn't show any emotions during the interview.
Last month, he admitted that he kidnapped, used sex and murdered a girl.
A man's lawyer said his client was raised in "an imperfect family".
He was supposed to be harassed as a child.
He also added that Whipple is aware that he has committed a terrible act and is ready to take the punishment.
The man was sentenced to life without being able to seek parole.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that he would hand over nearly $100 million additional funds to the communities affected by the drought.
The programme providing the money to farmers affected will be expanded and the criteria for the allocation of additives to farms will be simplified.
The aid package covers nearly $34 million in support for the affected communities, thus enabling the eligible farmers to receive up to $3,000 in emergency cases.
Each of the 13 local self-government areas under the affected community aid programme will receive up to $1 million in infrastructure and disaster relief.
The new support package is an addition to more than $7 billion allocated by the government to the drought-fighting fund.

In the Name of Love China's Masters Busters
documentary: In China, the number of divorces has increased twice in the last decade.
The reason for this condition was generally third-party.
More and more men maintain extramarital relations, leading to the formation of a particular industry in the country – a professional gathering of lovers who are intended to save the marriages of betrayed women.
Let's shout out loud: Ma-te-usz!
Trying to welcome the Prime Minister in Pekara Słуски
A special general attempt was made before the election with Prime Minister Maeusz Morawiecki in Silesian Squares.
“The honourable state, more loud, more loud, this is not how we welcome the Prime Minister here!
Let's shout out loud: Ma-te-usz!", encouraged the hard-driving.
Unfortunately, the enthusiastic efforts of leadership did not produce the expected result.
The campaign is on the move.
Politicians are going all over the country, convincing the voters.
An intensive campaign is also conducted by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who is a frequent guest in the region as a leader of the PiS.
Each meeting is precisely planned, including the appropriate repair.
It was also, rather, to be, in the Sluice Caves.
A special guest should be welcomed.
Before meeting the Prime Minister, he decided to conduct a general trial in the Chamber.
There's nothing intruder was trying to encourage the crowd to question the name of the chief of the government.
"This will not be a greeting to me, only to Prime Minister Mateus Morawiecki!
And louder, louder, my dear!" he encouraged disillusioned.
Unfortunately, the crowd was not able to take full advantage of the hot moods of the driver and was reluctant to respond to Ma-te-usz, but the recording of the enthusiastic leadership makes a hole in the network.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A man convicted of murdering his former wife in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was sentenced to the 2014 murder of Stephen and Katie Stay and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.
According to the authorities, he went into the house of Stay on July 9, 2014, requesting the disclosure of his wife's residence, Melannie Haskell, with whom he was in separation.
She wasn't there, but she was her sister, Katie Stay and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys aged 13 and 4, and two girls aged 9 and 7, died when Haskell opened fire, as Harris's Sheriff's Office says.
Only one family member survived, 15-year-old Cassidy Stay.
The authorities claimed that she was badly injured, but she managed to recover completely.
On Thursday, the jury members rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's defense on the basis of illiteracy.
The lion of the sworn ones will gather again on Monday to give the verdict.
The quantum internet is getting closer and closer to reality – ScienceDaily
The U.S. Army's results move quantum internet closer.
Such internet could offer military capabilities in terms of security, detection and accuracy of time maintenance in the traditional approach to networking.
The Centre for the Comprehensive Quantitative Processing of Military Information Research Laboratory for the Development of the U.S. Army's Operational Capabilities was seen by researchers from the University of Insbruck who managed to achieve a record transfer of the state between the material and the light – at a distance of 50 kilometres using light cables.
Splitting is a correlation that can occur between quantities such as cubes.
When two cubes are split and one of them is measured, it will have an impact on the measurement of the other one, even if the other cube is physically remote.
"These [50 kilometers] are two rows of sizes beyond what was previously possible and it is feasible to extend to the start of the construction of quantum inter-urban networks," said Dr. Ben Lanyon, an experimental physicist at the University of Innsbruck and the main researcher in the project whose discovery was published in the Nature magazine, the Quantum Information section.
Quantum networks would consist of distant bonds of physical cubes that are intertwined with each other despite a great physical distance.
Researchers have found that the spread of the complex state is necessary for the creation of the quantum internet.
"This demonstration is a huge step forward to achieve a large-scale widespread state," said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-authorizing the military programme supporting these research.
The quality of the state of the second end is also high enough to meet some of the most difficult applications of quantum networks.
The research team started an experiment from the calcium atom trapped in the ion capture.
Using laser bonds, researchers entered quantum status in jon while encouraging him to emit a photon in which quantum information was recorded.
As a result, the quantum state of the atom and the particles of the light have been crushed.
The challenge is to send photos with a light source cable.
"The photon emitted by ion of calcium has a wavelength of 854 nanometers and is quickly absorbed by lighthouses," Lanyon said.
That is why his team initially sent a piece of light through a nonlinear crystal lit by a powerful laser beam.
The length of the photon wave was converted to the optimal value from the point of view of the transmission to a long distance – the current standard telecommunications wavelength of the wave is 1550 nanometers.
Next, the researchers sent this photon through a 50-kilometre light source cable.
Their measurements show that the atoms and particles of light were still floating even after the wave length was transformed and the distance passed.
"The decision on the choice of calcium means that the result is a direct path to the creation of a complex network of atomic clocks at great physical distances, because calcium can be combined with a high-quality "magic" cube.
The army is very interested in large-scale networked clocks, due to the application of precise positioning, precise navigation and time synchronisation," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a military researcher, who also co-chairs the programme.
