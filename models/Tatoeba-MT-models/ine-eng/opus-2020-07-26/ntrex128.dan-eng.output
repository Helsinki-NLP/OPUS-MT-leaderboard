The politicians in Wales are afraid to "like fools"
There was indignation among some members of the Welsh National Assembly on a proposal that their title should be changed to MWP's (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It was because of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament (the Wallis Parliament).
AMs from all over the political spectrum are concerned that the name change could give rise to ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned because "it rhymes on Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: On the wallisically, towp means fool, and towp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said that the group as a whole "was not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Walysian conservative said that his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there is only a short verbal jump from MWP to Muppet (fjols).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is spoken in the same way as the letter u is spoken in Yorkshire-English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drawing up a legislative proposal to introduce the amendments, said: "The final decision on the names which Members of Parliament will receive is of course up to Members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals, with broad support for calling the assembly a Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the AMs, the Commission welcomed the Welsh Parliament Members (valiarian Members) or WMPs, but the MWP had the greatest support in public consultation.
AM'er proposes apparently alternative options, but the struggle to reach agreement can prove difficult for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to draw up a legislative proposal on the amendments within a few weeks.
The legislative proposal on reforms contains other changes in the way in which the assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs have the final vote on what they should be called when the legislative proposal is being debated.
Macedonians vote on the amendment of the country's name
The electorate agrees on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to "the Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote will be held in an attempt to resolve a decade of conflict with the neighbouring Greece, whose own province is Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a requirement in the territory of Greece and has long protested against Macedonia's attempt to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the vote and says he will sign the vote.
Members of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is merely a price paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's will be quiet while the churches in Harlem fight
"The older people I have spoken to said that in old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr Adams.
"Today there are none of the parts."
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
"People are socializing in other ways today," he said.
"Bars no longer constitute the living room of the neighborhood, where people enter on a daily basis."
In relation to the church, he is concerned that the money that was sought to sell assets does not last long and that they are "before or after where they started".
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes full of people who don't help the neighborhood's return times.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he says, "and it breathes further into the development where these churches finally close completely, because it is unlikely that most people who move into the apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had worked nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under priest John Howard Johnson, who stood at the top of a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who would not hire or promote black.
A fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but when Johnson’s son-in-law made plans to restore the building, they ordered the clock game.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the clock "the watches of the poor."
The expert who played the watch game in June called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first watch game in the world that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the largest watch game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't find a replacement for him.
What has taken place in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated story about architects and contractors. Some of them have been obtained by the church's leaders, others by the bishop.
In July, the Council of the Community – the leading body of the Sogents, consisting of leading doctors – wrote to the Bishop about concerns that the Bishop "will try to push the expenses further" to the Council of the Congregation, even though the Council of the Congregation had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors who the Bishop had sent in.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishop.
Haj harms 13-year-old on diving after lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he was diving after lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials say.
The attack took place just before 7 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then with a group headed over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just a thrill to have caught a lobster, but so he realized that the boy cried out, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
"All his demands were lifted up," said Hammel, he saw when he came to the boy.
"I cried that everyone should come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was flew to the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was reported in critical condition.
It's unclear what kind of shark there attacked.
Liver Larry Giles said in a media briefing that there was a shark in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage to his upper torso.
Officials closed their access to the beach on the stretch from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for safety purposes and to conduct investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take up the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's takes up the competition with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with ranges of beauty products with special assistants in the style of big stores.
As part of a major effort to take part in the UK beauty market, which has a value of GBP 2.8 billion and continues to grow while fashion and housing products decline. The major ranges of beauty products are tested in 11 stores around the country and launched in several shops next year if they prove to be a success.
The investment in beauty products is taking place as the supermarkets search for new goods for shelves previously used for television, microwaves and residential products.
Sainsbury's says they double their range of beauty products into 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, introduced for the first time.
The existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with burnt areas in style with them, you see in shops like Boots.
The Super Market also relaunchs a range of Boutique-makeup, so most products are suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly required by younger shoppers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop is tested in two Sainsbury's shops. The first opened in Croydon in the southern part of London last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a development against buying small quantities of food daily in local buyers means that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury's, has said that stores are going to look like big stores, as the supermarket chain takes up the fight with discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing several services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales sites in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales sites, since they bought both chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their sales of daily products and made the purchases more profitable.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to update beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint action with Boots in the early 00s, but cooperation ended with a dispute about how to distribute the profits of the pharmacists in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes, after Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy chain with 281 stores to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 GBP three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding a further range of luxury skin care fires such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the appearance and layout of our range of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to advise.
Our selection of fires is designed to suit all needs and the absorbing environment and the practical locations means that we are now a convincing destination that challenges the old way to shop."
Peter Jones "racing" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to GBP 11 million
Dragons' The Star Peter Jones left "racing", after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to GBP 11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their residential and accessory fire True.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop fire.
This Morning Host, 37, went to Instagram to announce that she was leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' The furious Peter Jones star, after she withdraws from their luxurious lifestyle fire at the last moment – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "racing", as the popular TV woman during a tense meeting Tuesday in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow in Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements – with a value of up to GBP 1.5 million – meant that she no longer had time for their home product and accessories brand True.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop fire and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated assets of GBP 11 million.
Willoughby, 37, went to Instagram to announce that she had left True while Jones flew out of the United Kingdom to one of her holiday homes.
A source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project that she would have been dealing with over the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised all those involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods in Marlow's headquarters, which is already ready for sale."
Experts estimate that the release from this Morning host, which is one of Britain’s highest-income stars, can cost the company several million because of large investments in products – from pudding to clothing and household products – and the potential for further delays in the launch.
And that could also end a long friendship.
Mother to three Willoughby and the housekeeper Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created True together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman of the board in March.
The two couples take vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby has to be a fire ambassador for M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin as being on ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business."
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
He made a joke with the criticism he would get from the news media to give a comment that "is not a president worthy" and to be so positive to the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his parody at a news store.
"I gave up nothing."
He noted that Kim was interested in a meeting more, after Trump launched their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the nuclear exploitation of North Korea.
But the negotiations on atmospheric pollution have been in progress.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in the UN General Assembly Saturday that North Korea does not see a "equivalent reaction" from the United States in relation to North Korea's initial action against disarmament.
He noted that, instead, the United States continues with sanctions designed to keep the pressure running.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view in the speech at his election meeting.
"It's really good with North Korea," he said.
"There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his attempt to improve Kim’s relationship had led to positive results — the completion of the rocket tests, the release of hostages, and the return of Earth’s remains from American military personnel.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
"It's so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this close-packed arena, we would have about 200 people standing there," Trump said and pointed to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunamis and earthquakes increase islands and kill hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, non-governmental organizations, for example, were informed that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population were absent, the state of the national disaster was not declared, which is a prerequisite for calling for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has been clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so it is a little challenging," said Sumbun.
While Save the Children make up a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign workers can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson for the national disaster preparedness, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the emergency response.
Because of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly subjected to, the country is very poorly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami resorts are built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight on other coastlines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but there seems to be a lack of a tsunami, and it has probably affected the death rate.
Even under the best conditions, it is challenging to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been in Lombok to treat earthquakes is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new crash site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's infrastructure a central point in his election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and two-storey roads.
But Mr Joko's administration has been plagued by lack of funding in the course of the election campaign next year.
Mr Joko also experiences pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were removed from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, bows, and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge matches last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in Premier League to Chelsea with a score on the 89 minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a delivery from Xherdan Shaqiri, a small 30 metres from Chelsea's target, while his team was behind with 1-0.
He pointed to the ball with his left foot before making a high shot against the remotest pillar.
The ball flew high over the field against the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and went online.
"It was just about getting in the position to get into the ball. Players like Shaq always try to get as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come, and I made a single touch, and I didn't think so much about it, and I just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 at the midpoint, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea attacker returned with the helmet to Mateo Kovacic before he set the speed up on the main track and sprinted into the Liverpool track half.
Kovacic made a quick one-two on the middle track.
He then made a long delivery that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defense and ended up against the remotest tower with a left foot shot past Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool fights Napoli in the team game at the Champions League at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in UEFA Europe League at 15 Thursday in London.
The number of deaths from tsunamis in Indonesia rises to 832
The death rate from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832 informs the country's disaster preparedness early Sunday.
Many were caught in the walls of buildings falling after the earthquake, measuring 7.5 on the right-hand side. It hit Friday and created up to 6 meters high waves, spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by walled buildings.
Police arrests a man of 32 in suspicion of murder, after a woman drowned in death
A murder investigation was initiated, after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 p.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested suspected of murder.
The police have called on people in the area, who saw or heard anything about coming forward.
Police assistant Brian O'Hagan said: "We are in the early stages of the investigation, but I will invite all those who stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and then or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I would also like to invite all, particularly tax administrators, who may have taken part in the Dashcam, to contact us as they may have information that may be crucial to the investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police say that they are in the process of informing the victim.
A tax collector who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but is told by the police that no one must enter the building.
He was lame when he heard what had happened.
The people are now told that there are hours to go before they can get back in.
A police officer was interrogated to tell a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman is coming.
She keeps saying, "It's so scary."
At 14 o'clock, there were two police cars inside the lockdown and another car outside.
A number of officers stood in front of the lockdown and monitored the apartment complex.
All with information please write a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and inform log 247 on 30 September.
Parliament's Statute of Cromwell will be the last monument to be debated on "rewriting history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic, Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as a "gallery" and an "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of the statutes that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace at Westminster would become a goal.
The image storm during the English civil war was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for his grandfather Thomas' actions in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's fantastic depiction of Cromwell is a testimony to attitudes in the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many still believe is worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against out-of-court pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate picture is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure representing the one side of the struggle.
His performances as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Drébergris attacks and kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China according to local media reports.
The man, who was identified only under his last name "Yuan", was found dead with an exaggerated pulsed pulse and intruded in blood near a pigster on the market in the Guizhou province of Liupanshui, South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farm prepares to give pig injections with vaccines at a pig consumption on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the Qinghai province of China.
He had evidently traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the priest found him dead and discovered that a door to the greystone next to it was open.
He said there was a big hole in the graystyrene with blood in his mouth.
A medical examination confirmed that the 250 kg pig had helped the farmer to die, according to the report.
"My cousin's bones were bloody and boiled," said the cousin, who goes under the last name "Wu", in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings from security cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousins.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while the police collect evidence at the scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
It belongs to rare people, but there have been previously recorded cases where pigs have attacked humans.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a pig weighed 295 kg a whale farmer against his tractor, entering his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pig in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba CBC News said that pig is normally not aggressive, but the taste of blood can work as a "trigger".
"They're just toys.
The nerves, they're very curious... they're not going to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect," he said.
The rest of the hurricane Rosa is expected to give heavy rains in large parts of the southwest United States
As predicted, the hurricane will become weaker, as it moves over the cooler water at the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will give a lot of rain in the north of Mexico and the southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had a win of 38 m/s, a category 1 orchid, at 10 Sunday (Danish time) and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move to the north of Sunday.
At the same time, there is a low-pressure exit across the Pacific, moving east towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push tropical moisture towards the north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm rain in parts of Mexico Monday.
Then the tropical moisture will interact with the low-pressure exhauster, which will come closer, and create strong rain in the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storms, liquid rainfall and possibly soil in the desert.
The tropical moisture will create rain with up to 51 to 76 mm rain per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
There are expected to be up to 51 to 101 mm rain in parts of the southwest USA, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There is a high probability of storms with rapidly worsening conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move out into the desert to foot when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn the waves into stormy rivers and droughts will create strong local winds and create dust blasts.</seg>
The low pressure exhauster approaching will give strong rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total rainfall of more than 13 mm, which may give lower amounts of liquid rainfall and smooth roads.
This would be the region's first rainfall in its rainy season.
Spreading tropical rainforests will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the area of Four Corners Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October, there may be large temperatures throughout the United States, as the Arctic is getting colder, but there remains fairly warm in the tropical.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences across the Central USA Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
During the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the Central and Eastern USA are expected to experience a hot start in October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the north-east areas.</seg>
There may be up to 26 degrees in New York City Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long climate outlook suggests that temperatures above average in the eastern United States are high in the first half of October.
Over 20 million saw Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million were seen on Thursday's violent testimony from the nominated to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle continued with stations that interrupted the regular programs to tell about Friday's late development: an agreement made by Senator of Arizona Jeff Flake, who allowed the FBI to conduct a week's investigation of the accused.
Ford told the senate’s ruling committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh, in a drunken state, was grumbled at her and tried to take her clothes off to a gymnasium party.
Kavanaugh said in a sentimental statement that he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, 20.4 million saw it on Friday.
The company recorded average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were not immediately available viewers from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems measuring how many programs are seen in offices.
To put it in perspective, it is a sawmill that corresponds to a match under the NFL playoffs or Oscar distribution.
Fox News Channel, whose opinions are strongly supported by the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all the stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republicans issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was arrested for open CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning, while demonstrators shouted at him when he tried to take an elevator to the hearing of the ruling committee.
He was looking down for several minutes while he was stabbed out, and CNN sent live.
"I'm right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had sent a statement and said before the elevator closed he would have more to say at the hearing of the committee.
All the TV stations covered live a few hours later, as the ruling committee had to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should go further to a vote for the whole Senate.
But Flake said that he would vote only under the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominated next week, which the Democrats, who are in the Senate, had asked for.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
The election of Flakes had an effect because it was clear that the Republicans would not vote to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh.
Britain's Prime Minister accuses critics of "legging politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU to "legislate politics" with Britain's future and undermine national interests.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In a second interview with Theresa May on the front page of the paper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson presented his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "all through ridiculous".
Shooting on Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected to stand behind the LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of indiscriminate manslaughter, said the police in Baton Rouge.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA, reported the CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After the Simpson investigation, the police said that he had admitted the shooting on Wayde.
His bail is set to $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The lawyer in East Baton Rouge Parish sent a preliminary report on Friday, where it was said that the cause of death was a wound from a gunshot shot that went from the head to the neck.
The police department says that a task force from Louisiana State Police, state police lab, South University police and citizens in the area have assisted with the investigation leading to the arrest.
The sport leader of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police in the area of their "earth and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach at LSU, Will Wade, said that the team was "crushed" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
"It's the kind you're always afraid of," said Wade.
Volcano Spy ash over Mexico City
Aske, which is sprayed from the Volcano Popocatepetl, has reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to get away from the volcano, after which activity occurred in the crater, and 183 emissions of gas and ashes were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre monitored the rumbles and cracks over several rounds.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ash on car routes in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, 72 kilometres south-east of the capital, since a earthquake measuring 7.1 on the right-hand side, the central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
The police are meeting with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote.
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after demonstrators who wanted independence, met with security officers as they participated in several thousand rival demonstrations, marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote on liberation.
A group of masked separatists kept horoscopes, thrown with and powder painting and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There was also a fight later on the day when the police used their staff to keep the fights down.
Over several hours, independence groups called for "Nothing forgotten, nothing forgiven", and met with Unionist demonstrators calling for "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries that occurred during the protests, reported the local press.
The vote continued to be high in the less independent region one year after the vote on 1 October, which was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters voted to an overwhelming degree for independence, but the voter's connection was low, and those who opposed the ransom boycotted the vote in a large way.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year, after the police tried to stop the holding of the vote during violent clashes at polls throughout the region.
Independence groups had camped at night on Friday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration was held, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had any hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy at having the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they were given a sneer, but important, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain the moment, and many of their best-known leaders have either moved to exile or are in detention and await their role in the holding of the vote and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the protests on his phone as support for the police and said that the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"There will be more and more tensions," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been awaiting his trial since last year, announced that he would put up with the European Parliament's election next year.
"The position as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to withdraw from the backdrop of democratic values and the subjugation we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested, by house framed by car
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested, after a car several times entered a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19.30 BST.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
Perhaps an armrest was also fired against the car at a time.
Shoot from Menga gives Livingston victory on 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
The fans of Livingston interrupted Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his only second defeat after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot made the difference when Gary Holt's team pulled up side by side with Hibernian in the second place.
Gerard's team has not won off the league in this season and will meet the leading team of Hearts, which they find eight points after, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will be visiting Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
Livingston, in return, builds their unbeatable strips into six matches, and Chief Holt has still not received a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chance against cash retention
Holt's team should have been ahead long before, they scored, and their direct playing style created big problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but delivered across the front of the target, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit out of the target, after he went in to hit Craig Halket's cross-head in front of the target.
The household was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them because they knew that they could bring up problems in the event of death.
And it was under the conditions that the important objective came.
Rangers started a fresh park, and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created the layout together for Menga, who made a touch and scored from the center of the field.
At the time, Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but fought to get through the defense of the household, and Mr. Liam Kelly was largely not challenged.
The pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos withdrew a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was fired with the feet of the Rangers opponent Allan McGregor, and Lithgov shot out of the frame under another of Livingstone's deadly situations.
Current deliveries came into the Livingstone field, but were rejected, and two demands for a penal park – after Halket's seizure on the alternate Glenn Middleton and one hand on the ball – were rejected.
"Remarkable" by Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotlands Alaskar Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal effort and strong result for Livingston.
Everyone played fantastic and surpassed the expectations of their upward journey.
Their playstyle and body are largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but a large part of the honor must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he entered.
There were many heroes.
Commander Halkett was fantastic and led a well-organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes throughout the fight.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
They have sometimes been really good at Gerrard, but they played at level.
Their endings lacked sharpness – only once they received the mere homehold – and it is a sharp awakening for Rangers, located in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There was a smile and blue sky Saturday (September 29th), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to improve relations with the two NATO members.
There have been disagreements over areas such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU approaches.
Erdogan then took to Cologne to open a new, large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police were held for security reasons a total of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – also noticed and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to take the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as a whole of some German Turks and the horn as an autocrat of others.
Accident on the way in Deepford: Cyclists die in comparison with a car
A cyclist is dead in a collision with a car in London.
Unhappily, close to the crossing between Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwest of the city around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and there was a rescuer on the spot, but the man died on the spot.
The accident takes place a few months, after another cyclist died in a collision with a car, whose driver ran away from the scene, on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from the car accident.
Metropolitan Police said police officers were working to identify the man and inform his contact.
Roadblocks have been set up, bus routes have been replaced, and motorists are invited to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six officials injured during anxiety
Six prison officials have been injured in a high-security prison, according to Prison Office.
There was concern in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire about 9.30 BST Sunday, and the riots are still on.
Specialized "Tornado" staff are brought in to handle the riots involving eight prisoners and taking place in one flight of the prison.
Officials were treated for minor facial damage on site.
One spokesperson for Prison Service said: "The specially trained prison staff are set up to deal with the current unrest in the HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and it's clear that those responsible are being reported to the police and can end up spending longer time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison inspector was treated at the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, a security officer was summoned to prison to deal with serious unrest, where employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Orkanen Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storms (dry areas can benefit)
It is rare that a tropical low pressure strikes Arizona, but it is most likely at the beginning of next week when the remnants of the Orcana Rosa move over the desert landscape in the southwestern United States and create a risk of storms.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings of storms for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix Tuesday with arrival sent Monday with rain.
National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only "Third tropical cyclones had maintained status as a tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km from the border to Arizona."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm rain with isolated volumes up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to reach 25 to 51 mm with the possibility of 102 mm locally.
For those outside the risk of storms, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will benefit because the South-West United States is currently experiencing drought.</seg>
According to the U.S. drought monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the next highest category," reports weather.com.
First, the Orkan Rosa is expected to hit land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.</seg>
Rosa still has an energy force Sunday morning with a maximum wind power of 38 m/s and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves north with 19 km/h.
The storm encounters colder waters in the Pacific and therefore decreases in strength.
It is therefore expected to strike in Mexico with tropical power Monday afternoon or evening.
The billing of parts of Mexico can become strong and pose a great risk of flooding.
"There is expected rainfall of a total of 76 to 152 mm from Baja California to the northwest Sonora with the possibility of up to 254 mm", weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona early in the morning of Tuesday as a tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into the south of Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The primary expected danger from Rosa or the rest of it is very strong rain in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert area of the United States," the National Hurricane Center reported.
The rain is expected to create life-threatening storms and flooding in the deserts as well as earthquakes in the mountainous region.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 4 BST Saturday.
He was brought to the hospital, where his condition was reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two- 18-year-old, and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, says the police in Avon and Somerset.
Officers have called on everyone who had to have mobile recordings of the events to come forward.
Trump says that Kavanaugh was under the "wickness and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"A vote on Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the thoughtless and vicious tactics of the democratic party," Trump said at a election meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been exposed to "the evil, the anger" of the democratic party through the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave a witness in front of the convention on Thursday and strongly and emotionally charged Christine Blasey Ford that he had been sexually assaulted by her for decades when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave evidence at the hearing on his charges.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" at Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that confirms one of the most powerful legal brains of our time, a lawyer with a fantastic past in public service," he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to the appointment of Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of Republicans meeting at the polling stations in the mid-term elections.
"In five weeks, one of the most important choices is our lifetime.
You can't vote for me, but you're actually voting for me," he said.
"That's why I travel around and fight for fantastic candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "strike against and block".
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place on Friday, a person has placed high in the Republican party told CNN.
Several hundred killed by Indonesian earthquake and tsunamis, the death toll is growing
At least 384 were killed, and many of them were swept away by violent waves that hit the beach, when a large earthquake and a large tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, said authorities on Saturday.
Several hundred people were gathered to a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves hit the coast at the time of skiing, sucked many in death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the right scale.
"When the tsunami came yesterday, people were still engaged in activities on the beach. They did not run the same and were sacrificed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster preparedness BNPB, during a letter in Jakarta.
"Tsunami didn't come alone, the sled cars, tree trunks, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea 800 km/h before the affected coast.
More succeeded in surviving by climbing up trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The disaster preparedness has published air photographs showing many damaged buildings and shops, damaged and destroyed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal town continued to shake after breakfast on Saturday.
The range of earthquakes could be seen in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Board of Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released during the Great War of Friday was about 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and it may have made the tsunami larger, the board said.
Nugroho described the damage as "encapsulating" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were run together.
The corpses of a number of victims were found stuck under the wall cracks of congested buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been damaged, and 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho said that the death and damage could be greater along the 300 km long coastline north of Palu, the area of Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication "was completely paralyzed without information" from Donghala, Nugroho said.
"There are over 300,000 people living here," said Red Cross in a statement and added that their employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," they said.
The board was criticised on Saturday from many fronts not to disclose that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said that the waves had arrived within the time of the warning.
In amateur recordings shared in social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building who is desperate to call warnings about the tsunami coming closer to the people on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of the water is formed on the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the recordings at the same time.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that eliminated the communication about Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue effort.
The military has begun to send emergency flights from Jakarta and other cities, reports authorities, but there is still a strong need for food and basic needs among the evacuated.
The city airport has been reopened, but only for relief work, and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centres in Palu Sunday.
The death rate after Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's really bad.
World Visions employees from Dongalla have come safely to Palu city, where employees are looking for light during performances that are set up in the farm at their account. They came over areas with extensive damage on the road, Doseba said.
"They told me they were so many ruined houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when relief agencies began the barrage work of re-establishing the relief work, there were complaints that foreign relief workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, financial aid, supplies and workers from abroad must only enter if the area in which the accident occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian red cross.
"When the government says 'OK, it is a national disaster', we can open for international assistance, but there is no status yet."
On the second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing people stuck in the hope that their closest people would be the miracles that sparked the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled up by a witch.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under walls for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding country team, had trained two of the missing paragliders to Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were caught at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were among his students.
"As the veteran in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us how in the hours, after the news of the co-operation of Roa Roa Hotel circled in paragliding circles, he had desperately sent whatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who were in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, resulted only in one grey fluebe instead of two blues.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he says.
Twenty takes $26,750 while filling in the cash machine in Newport on the Livee
Twenty stolen Friday morning 26.750 USD from a Brink's crew who was filling up a cash machine in Newport on the Livee, according to a press release from the police in Newport.
The driver had emptied the money machine in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, criminal assistant Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran "back to Brink's staff" and stole a purse that should have been delivered.
Witnesses were so many suspects who fled the area, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
All with information on the identity of thieves please contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes the name of Ye.
He announced the shift on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: "The creature previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, had named Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change takes place before his performance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
He replaces the songs Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled for "sensitive reasons," said the show's creator.
The name is an abbreviation of his current artist name, but the West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier in the year, where he discussed his album title with the Big Boy radio workshop.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who've changed his name.
Sean Combs has changed between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
One of the former partners of the West, JAY-Z, has also changed between small and large letters and changed whether the binding line is included.
Mexico AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians, as the country is approaching the 50th year of a bloody return action against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "never would ever use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
Tropper shot at a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968 and killed 300 at a time when left-wing student movements hit many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly state grants to students and opening up more free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they use in field research, says investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
According to various parts of the U.S. government, comments on artificial intelligence are coming, but the United States still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced their plan last year and aims to take the lead in innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, since all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough within AI," Lee said.
Improving the budget could double the chances of the next major performance in the US of artificial intelligence, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is Managing Director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent companies in artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highest-ranked U.S. Othello player, and later he became head of Microsoft Research and Director of Google's Department in China.
Lee recognized previous technological competitions supported by the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge, held by the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition would come, so that the next visionaries could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government bonds, says Lee.
"It's not China that sucks the academic leaders, it's the big companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhDs within artificial intelligence should have automatically offered work permits.
China's State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a way that corresponds to the National Science Foundation and other state organizations' distribution of money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established a joint centre of artificial intelligence, which will involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the establishment of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF is currently investing over USD 100 million per year in research in artificial intelligence.
However, American legislation, which seeks to establish a national security commission for artificial intelligence, has remained silent for several months.
Macedonians vote on the amendment of the country's name
The Macedonian people voted Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to "the Republic of North Macedonia", an action that would resolve a decade-old battle with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's efforts to gain membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province named Macedonia and maintains that the name of its neighbours to the north constitutes a requirement in Greek territory and has therefore used their veto when Macedonia has sought membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the primary Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not participate in the vote, and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the vote would amount to the 50 % required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you for NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
In addition to the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, it is worth paying to create access to associations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote on the country's future, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the EU's umbrella, because it means more secure life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote and make it applicable.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said that at 13 p.m., no irregularities were reported.
However, the election rate was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the latest parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong to Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an elector in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko participated in the Macedonian vote on a change of country name, which would open up for membership of NATO and the EU, in Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and took a stand in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the vote.
"We are for NATO and the European Union, but we will get membership with travelling panda, not at the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would make a strong investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think a large majority will vote because more than 80 per cent of our citizens go to the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said that a "yes" result would be a "securing our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters would participate in the vote – less than the required vote.
Another poll by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV indicated that 57 per cent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the vote shall be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the pilot government since it took place last May.
See: Manchester Cities Sergio Aguero fights throughout Brighton's defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton defense in Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his score coming after 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a delivery on the middle track at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran fast past three Brighton defenders before he jumped out on the open road.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green threads.
He fought past one defence, and ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a delivery to the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used its first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used its right shoe to list the Brighton-Meadman Mathew Ryan with a right-hand shot of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems with his feet," the city manager Pep Guardiola told the reports.
"We talked about him playing about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a target right now."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the immediate jump in the Premier League fight.
That goal came after 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball in that sequence deep inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice delivery along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of contacts before he led Sterling to the remotest pillar.
The Sky Blues advance pushed the ball into the net, just before the light passed the target.
City fights against Hoppenheim in the team game at Champions League at 12.55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will drill Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to take up the castetuen Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still a chance to participate in the playoffs for Rockies, who have played a fight more than Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies held at least in a wild-card slot with a 5-2-victor over National Friday night, but still has their first division title for good.
"Although we have nothing to play for, we can go to the fight well aware that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audience here in Denver, and that the opponents would play at the highest enough level I'm going to face this year.
Why shouldn't I be excited to play under the circumstances?"
Nationals have not yet reported the launch of Sunday, but will probably put Scherzer into such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the plate for 34th time, trained his cast Tuesday and would pitche on Sunday, which is usually his holiday.
The right-hand player from Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 in this season.
Trump holds a election meeting in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation about his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of Republicans meeting at the polling stations at the mid-term elections.
"All we've done is in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
It's one of the big, big – you can't vote on me, but you're actually voting on me. That's why I'm going around and fighting for fantastic candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you can see it happening right now.
And they're determined to get the power back with all the means available.
They don't care who they're hurting, who they're going to run to get power and control. That's what they want, power and control, but we won't give them that."
The Democrats, he said, have as mission "to fight and block".
"And you have seen it in the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "wrath and evil and hostile and false."
He referred to the senior democratic senator in the Senate's ruling committee, Diane Feinstein, by name, which triggered a loud bow from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you drop the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, oh no, wait straight – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a space party.
They are intolerant to those who express their views
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't really a surprise.
I am only the latest in a number of Labour Members who have been informed that we are not welcome – only because we have made our point.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she took a strong stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship went out to criticize me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of a responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically similar problems in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
At the meeting in Nottingham East Labour on Friday, we said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a local member of Parliament, the meetings were just like this on Friday night.
Today, the tone in many meetings is unfortunately not like that, and the promise of "friendlyer, lighter" policy is far behind in the past if it ever started.
It has become more and more clear that divergent views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are based on whether the party's leadership can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues, as I previously thought, I shared the political stand with, began to expect me to make a U-turn and adopt positions that I would otherwise never have agreed on – whether it was about national security or the EU's internal market.
When I say my opinion in the public – and this is really just a lot of what I say – a long strip of gross messages follow on the social media that calls for the choice and opposition of the mid-term policy and tells me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are usually political.
I have deep respect for professionalism and the will of colleagues who are overcrowded every day with sexism or racism, but still struggles further.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour would create a tolerant culture.
But in fact, it is no longer a spatial organization and with each vote of mistrust or change in the rules of choice, the party becomes smaller.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years that if I lay low on myself and I'm not so demanding, I'm gonna have to "get it done."
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I became a member of Labour 32 years ago, when I went to school, I was provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which had left our classroom in a state of decline, and I sat down to create better public services for those who need it most – whether it has been a city council member or a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, not during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the motion for a resolution on Friday, I would like to say that when the country moves forward towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of Labour.
But the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the local voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no kind of threat of choice or political suitability will hold me back from acting on what I think is your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbelieved Ayr Becomes Toptained
Two late scores may have got the final result to draw a not completely true picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned the victory in this fantastic entertaining match of the day in Tennant's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard and are the only uninhabited team of ten.
Finally, it was just as much of their superior defense as their better use of the chance that carried home the household, and coach Peter Murchie had absolutely the right to be satisfied.
"Our fights have been demanding so far, and we are still invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Respect for Ayr, they took advantage of their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's score after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr in front, but a yellow card to the Scottish footballer Rory Hughes, who was awarded to the Warriors' fight, gave Melrose a benefit, and Jason Baggot made a score that was not followed up by a kick.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a criminal park just before midnight. He scored and then got a solo score, so there was 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose began well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's score, which was followed by a kick from Baggot, reduced the point difference to five.
Then there was a long interruption because Ruarid Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was carried out by the track on the bar. When the game was resumed, Ayr developed the prom with a score from Stafford McDowall and a subsequent kick from Climo.
Ayr-institute Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card, and again took advantage of Melrose's extra man with a score from Bruce Colvine without subsequent kick after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson could follow a line-out score behind the future Ayr-klynge.
Climo followed up with a kick in the stairs and followed up with a more almost immediately after, the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe grabbed David Armstrong's box kick and sent flyers Gregor Henry off to the fifth round of the home track.
Set the Game stars to look for new careers in the restaurant industry
Still the game star Ford Kieran seems to take the step to the restaurant industry, after it came to the conclusion that he has taken the director's post for an authorised restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main person together with his partner Greg Hemphil.
The Duoen has announced that the next ninth season will be the end of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the Director of the Afro-Morn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but a source indicated to the Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"The sea is ours": the state of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Sleepers patrol around the fleet's main quarters, covered in rains, in La Paz.
On public buildings there is a sea blue flag.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River have been painted with the motto: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It's a duty to take it back."
Throughout the country, Bolivia is remembered for a coastal stretch that was lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century, still strong, and the same is the year after sailing on the Pacific again.
The hopes may be at their highest for decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a judgment from the International Court of Justice on 1 October following five years' vote.
"Bolivia has a moment, a feeling of community and clarity, and of course looks forward to the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country and hope that the Hague Court will give Bolivia content in that Chile – after several decades of discussion – is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia sovereignty over an area with access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatically native president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial election campaign next year, also has a lot to do with the refusal of the court on Monday.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific," he promised last August.
But analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will take the Bolivian party – and that there would be no major changes if it did.
The United Nations Assembly, which has its seat in the Netherlands, has no power to overcome Chilean territory and has stipulated that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice dismissed them only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have returned.
"The matter of access to the sea has been captured by the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morale's war rhetoric has done it with the remaining Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the discussions at a time, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end an era of 139 years with disagreements and gain benefits for both parties," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the maritime problem as a political cricket.
"Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past."
North Korea says there is no nuclear destruction unless they can rely on the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never destroy their nuclear weapons if they can't trust Washington first.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to comply with the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments were extended by the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo apparently facing a restart of the fixed atom diplomat over three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a ' wishful dream' to continue sanctions and the US's resistance to a declaration ending the Korean war will ever put North Korea on the knees.
Washington is lagging behind the declaration, so long as Pyongyang has not taken significant steps against disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump will have another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism as to whether Pyongyang is serious in terms of eliminating an arsenal that the country most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pyongyang next month as preparation for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashionshows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large main clothing that you will soon be able to buy in local stores
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne raised on the catwalk the veil for a collection of remarkable main clothing in extra size as part of their SS19 collection. The collection impressed on Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical had dominated Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down to the catwalk.
The most impressive work from Valentino was an overpowering with a wide-ranging shade covering the heads of the models.
There were also other extra large accessories, including watermelons with jewels and even a pineapple – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also discovered a selection of bizarre masks – right at the time of Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had combined lips that reminded more about Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like a diving thing with snorkel and mask, and others looked like a molten wafflelis.
And if you're going on with the big moods, you're lucky.
Sparrows predict that the huge hats could come to shops near you.
The kamphe hats arrive in the heels of "La Bomba", the beam hat with a 60 cm wide shadow seen on all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the most unpracticed hate that was spread over the social media has sent a new great creation down to the catwalk – a beach bag in straw, which is almost as big as the model that presents it.
The orange bassette with bastfries and a white leather handle was the most obvious in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in common stores next summer. The designer has had such a great influence that it will be hard to ignore the demand for accessories in size."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have many excellent academic results behind them, and in 2018 there are still a number of outstanding exam results, which are also strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other efforts in the local environment.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools strive, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), to deliver the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools try to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As a education sector that can compile and implement a tailor-made pensum, we experience that modern languages remain a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it hits his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will strike his heart."
It is an important reminder that we cannot only stay in English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can see from the latest results of the exam this year that language is the highest in statistics with most of the exams in independent schools.
In a total of 68 percent of foreign - language students received high grades A.
The data collected by SCIS' 74 member schools showed that 72 per cent of students received the character A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French, and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important competences that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now perceived as subject selection at the same level as STEM topics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' thoughts and elsewhere.
A study carried out by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that among the reasons why employers were unable to fill vacancies were 17% with missing language skills.
Thus, language skills become more and more important in preparing young people for their future careers.
Several job opportunities will in the future require language skills, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career young people choose, if they have learned another language, they have a great benefit in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The possibility of communicating directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a boost to competitors.
According to a YouTube survey of over 4,000 respondents in Britain in 2013, 75 per cent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multidigit percentage, 15 per cent.
Therefore, it is important to invest in language teaching for those who are children today.
When you can speak more languages, especially languages from developing countries, children are given a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, schools differ from one language to another.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach in languages that are expected to be most important for the United Kingdom when looking forward to 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose between independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills required to achieve success, no matter what the future offers.
At present it cannot be denied that language continues to be really important to the future of the country in a global business environment, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this excellence to the youth of Scotland.
It needs to be done.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron gets the debut for Laker's Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost over for fans who will see LeBron James playing his first fight for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James is playing in Sunday's opening game before the season starts against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still not fixed how many minutes he plays.
"It's going to be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James most likely won't play the whole game.
After the training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans in relation to the planned six matches of Lakers before the start of the season.
"Where I am in my career, I don't have to fight before the season starts to get ready," he said.
Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a strict election meeting tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled election sessions next week, including meetings in Trump's friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on the confirmation of Trump's appointed judges for the free seat at the Supreme Court is in vain, Trump seeks to build support for the forthcoming mid-term elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when the vote is delivered in November.
When is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump's election meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia is held at midnight (Danish time) between Saturday 29 November and Sunday 30 November 2018.
You can see Trump's election meeting in West Virginia online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely talk about this week's hearings about Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the Supreme Court. The hearings were challenged due to charges of sexual misconduct, and the expected vote in the Senate on confirmation was held for a week while the FBI investigates the charges.
However, the primary objective of this narrow election is to create a moment for the Republicans facing a difficult election in November.
People from President Trump's campaign team said that the next week's five electoral meetings aim to "make energy among the volunteers and support them when the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Control of the Congress is so important for his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible, now that we enter the busy campaign time," said a speaker for the Trump campaign, who would not be quoted by name, to Reuters.
Tonight's election meeting is held at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump's supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by the Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month, Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come up to give him a boost in his senses," said Simon Haeder, who deals with state science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown the battle and is trying to keep the hope alive ahead of the sunflower
After three unilateral rounds, the payer's four-man dunes might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The turning moment pendulum is a fully developed sport concept, but a concept that players believe – not least in competitions like this one.
So where would they say there's a moment now?
"They led with six points, and now it's four, so we'll see it a little bit as a moment," said Jordan Spieth before he held the fire.
Europe, of course, has the advantage: they are 4 points ahead, and there are 12 more points to play about.
As Speeth says, however, Americans feel that they have some wind in the sails, and there are lots of encouraging things to focus on, not least the shape of Speeth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both can float with three points of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The high shouts became higher, as the round continued, and Spieth struck an important well, which secured victory in duel four, even though he and Thomas had been two strikes behind two duels.
His husband, who assured them of the struggle on the 15th floor, met with a similar scream – the kind of scream that shows that he does not believe that the American team is out of competition yet.
"You just have to find the inner strength forward and focus on your own struggle," Spieth said.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, no doubt the biggest story from Ryder Cup.
Europe's remarkable but sympathetic couples have got four points in four matches, and it is a mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't get a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way the energy seems to flow in both to and from the wild audience shows that it is they that will be the most difficult to beat Sunday. And it would certainly be very popular if a potential European victory was captured by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Anyway, the synchronizing of each of their holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a short trial against Sergio Garcia, in the morning in the four-person duels, when he formed a couple with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two double boweys on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swedes down into a hole they were never near to get out.
Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fights with four balls and two hold a two players are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way that the strategy can change smoothly.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a significant lead before the last day, but the four-person duels have also shown that Team USA has the fight that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe creates 10-6 before the last day in Ryder Cup
Europe has a great advantage before the last day at Ryder Cup, after they came out of the caterpillar's fourballs and fuhrsomes with a lead over the United States of America at 10-6.
The successful duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two victories over a troubled Tiger Woods and has thus far got four points on Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, who tried to win the podium they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an inaccurate American team in the morning's fourballs and won the 3-1 series.
The U.S. gave more resistance to foursomes, they won four matches, but they were still behind.
Jim Fury's team should use eight points in Sunday's 12 single fight if they need to keep the pocal.
Fleetwood is the first European debuter who has won four points in motion, and he and Molinari, who together have got the nickname "Molliwood" are after a sensational weekend the only other couple in Ryder Cups history who have won four points in their first four matches.
The Woods and Patrick Reed broke into fourballs and then won elegantly a brave Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought through the first two matches on Saturday, had little genius shine, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in draw.
Justin Rose was excited about the morning’s four-balls and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and got a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the number three in the world.
Europe, however, has it completely, as they want it, on a light day in the south-west of Paris.
Three-twelf major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard-earned 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later returned and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in Ryder Cup history that a team has fought back after being back with four points before the single fights. Since Furyks currently has the pocal, however, they must achieve only without determination to keep it.
Having been the best for two days, however, it seems that they cannot master a stunning Sunday.
North Korea says they won't break unilaterally if there's no confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continuing sanctions would enhance their mistrust to the United States and that the country would not give up their nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the World Organisation that North Korea had shown "significant goodwill" in the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, establishing an area for nuclear testing and by not continuing to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We have not seen a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we ourselves will take the first step and defeat unilaterally."
While Ri reiterated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase divided" access to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took steps gradually. But his speech seemed important because it did not explicitly reject unilateral disarmament, as it had previously been the case from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint release from Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever between a situate US President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work "atmospheric shock on the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has requested a formal end to the Korean War, which took place in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up their nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also demonstrated resistance to wetting up severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on 'atmospheric destruction first' and expands the pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose by force and even opposes the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The belief that sanctions can bring us to knees is a dream of wish among people who don't know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions reinforce our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a summit more between Kim and Trump, as the US leader pointed out earlier this week by the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae in the last five months and added: "If nuclear weapons were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so closed."
Nevertheless, the tone in Ris was very different from the last year, where he told the UN General Assembly that the launch of North Korea's missiles against the US mainland was inevitable, after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on suicide mission.
Last year Trump in the United Nations threatened with "total destruction" of North Korea, but this year he praised Kim to show courage in relation to disarmament, but said that there is still much to be done and that sanctions are needed until North Korea falls.
Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a timetable for these actions, but said, "It's as much if it takes two years, three years, or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council must maintain the sanctions with conviction and without mistake until we achieve the total, final, confirmed nuclear destruction."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons programme.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sideline at the UN General Assembly and subsequently said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, while North Korea only a few hours after charged him with "walking demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile plant and an atomic complex if the United States took "a corresponding step."
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding steps", he demanded, were the security pledges that Trump gave in Singapore, as well as movements against normalization of Washington's relationship.
Students at Harvard take a course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all bachelor students more sleep. The purpose of the course is to counter the growing macho culture, where you study all night long held up by large quantities of caffeine.
One researcher has shown that students at the best university in the world often do not know the first thing about self - care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has made the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He got the idea of the course after having held a lecture on what effects sleep deprivation has on learning.
"When the job was done, a girl came up to me and said, "Why do I get to know this first when I'm on the candidate?"
"She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is offered for the first time this year, explains how good sleep habits can improve your academic and sports performance as well as your overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the university's health field, says that the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in serious sleeplessness during the week.
The hourly course consists, among other things, of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises there is a picture of a college room where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how your sports performance is affected by sleeplessness and how important good sleep habits are.
In another part of the course, participants hear how long-term lack of sleep increases the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression, and cancer.
Participants are invited to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map over campus.
"We know that it will not change the student's behavior at the same time.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride in taking a "nighter" still exists, he says and adds that modern technology and increased pressure on students have led to a growing lack of sleep.
The "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue and fear is good and enough sleep," he said – it even contradicts weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes the brain to believe that you are hungry, why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped last year Professor Czeisler organize the course when he took one of his courses on his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and made him work on making it a general course throughout the university.
He hopes that the next step will be to offer all graduates a similar course before continuing their training.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students put an alarm, so they know when to sleep and when to get up. This can create awareness of the harmful effects of the light from electronic screens that can run at the daily rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Measurements from Menga decreases Gerrard and co.
Rangers led another defeat on the outroad, when Dolly Menga's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's independent team had to take thanks to a defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
The holding from Ibrox was out after their first victory on stage since the 4-1-trium at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard the only second defeat in 18 games as a coach. Thus, there are eight points up to Hearts at the top of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Many beat to seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired ranger team could not respond to.
Rangers are now smoking down in a sixth place, while Livingston is climbing up in a third place after Hibernate with only the target score for the difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to Rangers, as line judges Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head of a cast object that looked like to come from the outway section.
Gerrard made eight changes in the layout that reached Betfed Cups semifinals by toning past Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, stood with the same 11, barbering a point of Hearts' behavior last week, and he would have been glad to see his sharp team exhausted the opponents throughout the course.
Rangers had the ball most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should have scored two minutes in the match, when Menga's first delivery sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle-tracker's attempt ran out.
A free park in the depth of Keaghan Jacobs found the way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense player Alan Lithgow jumped past the rearmost pillar.
Rangers took control, but played more hope than ability in the attack game.
Alfredo Morales was not satisfied at all when Judge Steven Thomson recognized the Colombians' appeals for a criminal park, when he and Steven Lawless brought together after a quarter game.
Rangers had only two targets in the first half, but former Rangers targetman Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's main support and Ovie Ejarias's thin shot.
Although the opening of the 34th minute was a coincidence, it has to be said to be worth their effort alone.
Once again, Rangers could not handle a deathball situation in the depth of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took time to find Menga, who could easily kick it in.
In the break, Gerrard Coulibally replaced Ryan Kent, which almost immediately gave the floor, when the player sent the ball into Morelos, but the successful Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingstone forced the rest to play on their prizes with many long balls up on the track from Lithgov and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have extended the lead in the last part of the fight, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with a safe hand before Lithgow headed next to the goal.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton once again appealed for a sentencing park after being dry with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked the other way.
Archaeology: The inventor of the geiger numerator
And now a page from the journal "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago – if we're... – was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that would in turn lead to the device known as the geiger numerator.
The Geiger counter has become a solid component of both science and popular culture, which could be seen in the film "Bells of Coronado" from 1950, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans had the main roles as peasant scientists:
Man: "What in the universe is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger numerator used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you take these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals makes."
Evans: "Stop it! Now it's over!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have filled 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune defense to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune defense to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of treatment
The method consists of removing the immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then "see" the protein that is common to many forms of cancer and where they are injected again.
A test vaccine is promising in patients with a range of cancers.
When an egg cancer woman was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of removing the immune cells from patients and changing them into the laboratory, so they can "see" the protein named HER2, which has many forms of cancer, and then injecting the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "have several forms of cancer to develop", including breast, ovaries, lungs and intestines, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, taking immune cells out of patients and teaching them to attack cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a particular type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held Trump's friendly speech introduced a MAGA hat after his SNL performance.
It didn't go well.
After an inconsistency in the Saturday Night Live study, Kanye West was released when he hailed the US President, Donald Trump, and said he himself would set up as president in 2020.
When he had played the third song of the evening Ghost Town introduced a Make America Great Again casket, he started at a thunderstorm against the Democrats and held his support for Trump.
"I talk so often to white people, who say, 'Why do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
But if I was worried about racism, I would have moved too long from the United States," he said.
SNL started the evening's show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate's judicial committee on Christine Blasey Ford's charges of assault.
Even though the recordings were not shown, the comic booker Chris Rock Wests drew on the social media.
It's uncertain if Rock tried to expose the West by setting up the recordings.
In addition, the West complained to the public about poor treatment backstage because of its main clothing.
"They mobbed me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat."
They mobbed me!
And they said that I was sick," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how deep I am?" and said that he would take on his Superman hat because it means that "You can't decide what to do. Do you want to make progress in the world?
Try with love."
The audience bubheed at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff seemed to be embarrassed, Variety reported with a comment from a person who was present: "There was bombed in the study."
The West had been booked as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose present boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West confused many by acting with the song I Love It while he was dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: TAK FOR NOT TO GIVE YOU OF THE PUBLIC."
Talkshow's Karen Hunter tweeted that the West is just "like he is, and it's totally fine."
"But I do NOT choose to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his "art") who embraces and exploits an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And so do we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced that he had changed his name to "the entity officially known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he follows Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colonel Snoop Dogg named Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased musical Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington longs out after toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known to swing swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent middle-age fantasy Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actress longs out after the stereotypical macho-helt and says that the kind of TV characters means that young men often feel that they have to be hard to be respected.
Kit said to Sunday Times Culture that he believes there's been something wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who was recently married to his Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem lies with him "very well in mind".
"For now I am very concerned – where have we gone wrong in the city with masculinity?" he said.
"When we look at the current problems, what is it that we have learned young men in their growth?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characteristics.
He continued, "What is born, and what is related?
What is it that young men learn from television and on the street that makes them feel that they should be men in this way?
I think it is one of the major issues of our time – how do we change it?
Because it is obvious that something has gone wrong for the young men."
During the interview, he also admitted that he would not make followers of the Game of Thrones when the series ended next summer, and said that he was "completed with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit participates in a replay of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film instructor and his brother, who is a thief.
The skater recently discovered that he considers it to have met his wife Rose as the best in the entire Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so that way she gave me my future family and shaped my life forever," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, like Kit's character, Jon Snow, is in love with, in the Emmy Award winning fantasy.
The couple were married in June 2018 on the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% rise in new cases
China has published a 14% increase in the number of people with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been hit, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of the new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people receiving HIV in this way has been reduced to something close to zero, Chinese health authorities say at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In one year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT environment.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalized, but discrimination against LGBT persons is said to be a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry women before or since because of the country's conservative values.
Many cases of infection are due to the lack of prevention in these circumstances.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff lack data on Republican senators and thordens against "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
A member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, denied on Saturday the allegations that a member of her staff has shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claimed that the claims were derived from websites and supported by the "extreme right wing".
"Leading, lying, and more terrible lies," Waters wrote in a Twitter resolution.
The published information included allegedly home addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted on the Internet on Thursday by an unknown person at Capitol Hill. It occurred during a hearing in the Senate of allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court named Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support pages as Gateway Pundit of RedState reported that the IP addresses indicated that the information had been posted by Waters' people, after which the published information about a member of the Waters staff, writes The Hill.
"This unwarranted charge is completely unwarranted and a direct lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false charges, is in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This unwarranted charge is completely false and a direct lie."
Waters' release was quickly criticised online, among other things by former press secretary in the White House Ari Fleischer.
"It's an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
"It suggests that she does not have the right temper to be a congressman.
If you get blamed for something you haven't done, don't get angry.
You don't have to be convincing.
You must not question the defendant's motives.
You have to keep your mind shut."
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Kavanaugh, who were criticised for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to take over Waters' seats in the mid-term election, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Location, if that's true," he tweeted.
In Waters' official statement, she says that her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and the law enforcement authorities regarding these misleading claims."
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are found," she continued. "And that they will be held legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone and anyone in my staff."
Review of Johnny English hits again – subterfuge spy comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in every recent film with a British island, and it also seems relevant to the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will the country's new export potential become a dry, sarcastic self-satisfaction?
In any event, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber look and the big eyes have been allowed to make the scents renewed again. His name signals more than anything that he is a comical invention directed towards places where the cinematographers do not speak English.
He is, of course, the muted secret agent who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a little Clouseau, a knife-tip Mr. Bean and a proper clay of him who performed a single tone to the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of OL in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the world-wide and international luxury kiss that left chaos in his chill, after Atkinson portraitd him in Barclaycard's television commercials.
There are some good moments in this last shot on the stem of JE.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a middle-aged equipment, and the propellers sang against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comics, but humor feels quite overwhelming and strangely superfluous, especially now that more "serious" films such as 007 and Mission Nea also offer convincing comics as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be directed towards children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy adventure is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's stupid film films in the role of Mr. Bean.
The never-ending starting point for the film is that the UK is in serious trouble.
An internet hacker has infiltrated England's top-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the English agents in the field of intimidation of the responsible agent – a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last chance for a prime minister who already suffers a complete collapse in political popularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the manuscript.
Since her security advisers inform her that every active spy has been discovered, she is obliged to cancel someone's pension.
And of course, it's the crazy Johnny English, who is now a school inspector at a high school, but who secretly teaches you how to become a secret agent. There are some funny sequences here when English stands for some kind of school of rock education in espionage.
English rushes back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and is reunited with his hard-tested previous right hand Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an over-enthusiastic but well-intentioned subspecies – a role played by Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the king's intelligence service is back in the unge of Batman and Robin, when they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful woman fatal, Ophelia Bullettova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is very close to getting involved in the charismatic and horrific tech billionaire Jason Volta – the game of Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England's computer problems.
English and Bough start their furious risk-filled squads: Dressed as servants they set fire to a former French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves on board Volta luxury yacht; and English creates pure ragnarok, as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to make himself familiar with Volta's house.
All the cannons are fired in the film's final sequence, but how well-being and energy it is, there is a sense of children's distance from it.
Right medium.
And as I couldn't avoid thinking about the other Johnny English films: Can't the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that gives his talent justice?
Labour refuses to trade with a four-day work week plan with unchanged pay to the British
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour is said to consider a radical plan so that the English can be satisfied with a four-day work week, but get paid for five.
The party will probably have business leaders to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give the employees an extra Friday.
This would mean that the employees would have three days a week without going down on wages.
Sources state that the idea would agree with the party's economic objective of drawing the country in a more favourable direction for workers.
Trade Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
An experienced member of the Larbur Party said to The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published before the end of the year."
"It will not happen in one day, but a Thursday's work week is a goal that fits with the party's access to change the economy for the benefit of workers and the party's overall strategy for industry."
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the election campaign for the parliamentary elections in 2017.
However, the objective is not supported by unanimity in the Labour Party.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party said: "A Thursday's work week is not the party's policy and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour's shadow finance minister John McDonnell used last week's party meeting to record his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell states that he is determined to flee the power back from "anonymous directors" and "usualists" in supply companies.
The Minister of Finance's plans also raise doubts as to whether the current shareholders of water supply companies will get their money back, as a government with Labour at the top could "modern" them on the basis of immoral actions.
He also confirmed plans to get employees in company boards and to establish including owners' funds, which are to allocate 10 per cent of the share of private companies to employees who are expected to receive up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 minutes if the FBI's study of Kavanaugh can change their vote
The FBI's investigation of allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has extended the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and it raises the question of whether the FBI's findings could get the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that was shown on Sunday, 60 minutes-journalist Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig up something that could make them change their attitude.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened – after the allegations came – and said, "Did you do it?"
He was steeled, determined and unique."
Graham's voice, on the other hand, seems to have been embellished in stone.
"I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and another would require a very violent accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett denied it at the most strongly," Graham added with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I can't see it's going to change anything."
What is the Festival of Global Citizens, and has it done to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York City hosted the Global Citizen Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive offer of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end the world’s poverty.
For the seventh time, the Global Citizens Festival will receive tens of thousands of people on Central Park's large lawn, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will draw attention to the real goal that is to end extreme poverty in 2030.
Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international interest organization that fights to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concerters must perform a number of tasks or "acts". e.g. make voluntary work, write to a world leader, make a telephone call or other meaningful action that can raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been, now that they have 12 years left to reach the goal?
Creates the idea of rewarding people with a free concert real change, or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism" – i.e. that people feel that they make a difference by signing a collection of signatures on the web or making a Twitter storage?
Global Citizen reports that since 2011 they have registered more than 19 million "actions" from their members towards different goals.
They believe that these actions have encouraged world leaders to make binding goals and political action equivalent to more than $37 billion, which in 2030 is expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 objectives and actions that had been achieved due to their actions, which ran up to over $10 billion, which had already been paid or collected.
The Group estimates that these funds have so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
One of the main objectives is The Power of Nutrition, which has been launched in England and is a collaboration between investors and business-intensive people. They strive to "help children to experience their full potential" and promise $35 million to address nutrition problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the English government, donors, the governments of other countries and world citizens like you, social injustice can become a footnote in the history books," the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the audience at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that the Government of England has now promised means to improve nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 online invitations. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with advice on nutrition.
As an answer to a frequently asked question on the website, which says, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen wrote: "It will be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we will slip and make mistakes.
But like the civil rights movement and the movements against apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are among the actors at this year's New York Festival. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman must be host.
The United States can use its fleet to "block" Russian energy exports, says the US Minister of the Interior
"If necessary", Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, even in the Middle East, reveals the US Interior Minister, Ryan Zinke, to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, particularly where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to expand the sale of their energy.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they will sell energy, as they do in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"The United States has with our fleet the opportunity to ensure that there is free passage on the sleeping grounds, and if necessary, we can also block them, so we can ensure that their energy does not come to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting held by Consumer Energy Alliance – a non-profit organization that views itself as "the voice of American energy consumers" – as a matter of fact.
He compared Washington's approach to handling Russia and Iran, and said that they are basically the same.
"The economic opportunities for Iran and Russia are about to exploit and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony", whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These opinions are based on the fact that the Trump administration has aimed at increasing European exports of liquid natural gas to replace Russia, which is the cheapest choice for European consumers.
To achieve this, speakers for the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 management project, which according to Trump has made Berlin to Moscow "captive".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is only an economic project.
Kremlin believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of different conditions of competition and is simply because of economic considerations.
"I believe that we share the view that energy should not be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with US Energy Minister Rick Perry, in September.
The position of the Americans is met by criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to intervene outside the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third party mixing in our energy supplies," said BDI leader Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" to stand up to the 2020 presidential election, says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren "thinking strongly" to stand up to the presidential election after the mid-term election, she said on Saturday.
At a city council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about getting up.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it requires a woman in front," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will give a strong consideration to the presidential election."
Warren made his point about President Donald Trump under the City Council and said that he "leads the country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren has been criticised by Trump and his high-ranking board, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren wrote: "Of course, the FBI must investigate the matter before the vote."
However, a Thursday's assessment shows that the majority of Warren's own country does not believe that it should be set up in 2020.
According to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "visible" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not set up.
32 % supported the possible candidacy.
The opinion showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick by 38% and 48% against a possible approach.
Other highly-profiled democratic candidates discussed in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
The bid says that he announces his final decision in January, writes Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's PTSD at a selection meeting for Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after reporting to the army in September.
Monday night, he was arrested and sentenced to domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through after he's come home makes me relate to other families that feel the consequences of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers are returning home with," she told the audience to a Trump election meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and become harder. They go and wonder if there is respect for it, their colleagues in the country and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was sentenced to violence at home against a woman in order to prevent the report of violence at home and to be in possession of a gun in a drunken state, says Dan Bennet, a spokesperson for the police in Wasillas.
18 states and D.C. support resistance to new asylum camps
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new American law that denies asylum to victims fleeing from gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. made a party-dependent statement in Washington on Friday to support an asylum-seeker who opposes the law, according to NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace v. Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal law, has not been published.
She said that her partner "and his violent sons who are band members" had abused her, but American officials rejected her application for asylum on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
The state prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of American asylum seekers come, such as countries with extensive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum-seeker failed to comply with a decision taken by the U.S. foreign exchange exercise in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants who fled from domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia State Advocate Karl Racine stated on Friday that the new law "exempts from the state, federal and international legislation for decades."
"Federal legislation requires all applications for asylum to be decided on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle is contrary to the principle," says the Party-dependent statement.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law on non-immigrants would harm the American economy, since they are more likely to become independent and "provide necessary labour".
In June, Justice Minister Jeff Sessions' immigration judges deprived the right to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asyl is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political standing," Sessions said in their declaration of the law on 11 June.
It has never been meant that asylum should solve all the problems – or just all the serious problems – that people around the world face every day.
While the death rate is doubled, attempts to find survivors in Palu despair
For survivors, the situation only got worse.
"It's very tense," said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while she comforted her little feverish boy at an evacuation centre in the destroyed town of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes in with bodies.
We need clean water."
The inhabitants now returned to their ruined homes to sort in bloodthirsty property and save what they could find.
Several hundred people were injured, and the hospitals, which were also hit by the earthquake of 7.5, were unable to follow.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and the shoulder, were outside Palus military hospital, where patients are treated for severe excrement outside.
He had tears in his eyes when he told us how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room in the fifth room, he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was massed up against a ruined wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press and added that his family was going to marry in the city.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador blames China for unfined methods and propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper, a four-page ad in an American newspaper that hit drums for the benefits of American-Chinese cooperation, the US ambassador in China Beijing accuses us of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump reported on Wednesday to China Daily's paid admission to the Des Moines Register – Iowa's best selling newspaper – after accusing China of getting involved in the 6 November Congress elections. China rejects the charge.
U.S. officials say to Reuters that Trump's accusation of Chinese interference in the US election marks a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now engaged in a escalating trade war, where they have in several ways imposed duties on each other's imports.
China's return to the trade war was to cover exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China, a former governor of Iowa, who is a large exporter of agricultural food to China, said that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a leader of Sunday's Des Moines Register that China "is tackling the use of the undiscovered methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government uses the proud American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by running a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In the kiosks here in Beijing, on the other hand, there will be only a few disagreements, and you will not get a fair picture of the Chinese people's different attitudes towards China's worrying economic direction, as the media are under strict control from the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, even though he did not say which.
The Republicans advise women in advance of the mid-term selection of the Kavanaugh case, warns analysts
Many of the top republics support and defend the Supreme Court's named Brett Kavanaugh against allegations of sexual abuse, warns analysts that they will experience a reaction in the future mid-term election, especially from women.
The case has put the feelings in the kitchen, and most Republicans have already published that they would like to see the voting process continue.
"This can't be done," said Grant Reher, professor of state science at the University of Syracuse Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article on Saturday.
Reher said he doubted that Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona)'s request for an FBI investigation for 11 hours would slow down the electorate.
"Women do not forget what happened yesterday – they do not forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to The Hill this Friday.
On Friday morning, during a demonstration in the Senate, the demonstrators called out: "November!" when the Republicans who control the judicial committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, it is said by Mic.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach new heights," said the independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg to the news media.
"People say that it has already reached a high level; that's right.
But it can reach even higher, especially among female swing voters in the mayors and younger voters – 18-29 – who rarely vote, despite not being able to like the president."
Even before Ford’s public allegations of the sexual abuse of the Supreme Court nominated, analysts had pointed out that it could give back if the Republicans continued with the nomination.
"It has become worse for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the committee's vote or the final outcome, or about Kavanaugh being held responsible; it is also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it," points Guy Cecil, president of the Priorities USA – a group that supports Democrats in being elected – to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to have shared views on whom they should believe according to the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, where the latter has a little more on their side.
A new opinion from YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents believed in Ford's testimony in a certain or probable way, while 35% said they believed in Kavanaugh in a certain or probable way.
In addition, 38% said that they believed that Kavanaugh was either probably or certainly lying during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following a call from Flake, the FBI now investigates the allegations made by Ford and at least another, Deborah Ramirez writes for The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate's legal committee last week that Kavanaugh was totally assaulted when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the high-level nominee showed her her sex to a party when they both studied at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to create a new internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, launches a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology department is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the plan with Inrupt is "world domination".
"We need to do it now," he said about the start-up company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology so people can make their own "personal online data collection" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, two-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data collection is that it is up to the user to determine who can access the specific information.
The company calls it "personal power through data".
The idea of Inrupt is, according to the company's managing director, John Bruce, to collect resources, processes and abilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contracts and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook or Google about whether to change it completely, so all their business models suddenly become redundant."
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a record on Medium in Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new internet built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the internet when he started World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about the next period of the internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Water: Spiritual recipient of the First World War of Victoria
The only priest of the English Church who won the Victorian Cross by fighting during World War I is celebrated in his home town 100 years later.
Colonel and priest Bernard Wand won the order on September 29, 1918, during the attack by Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a snowman and never learned that he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday, at least one of his two children was discovered at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his children, said it was "incredibly symbolic", that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's ordering business.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Watern of 29 September 1918 led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick train and under severe protection from masking and artillery."
He later ran to the front line and led with the "greatest manhood" of his people before he alone attacked an artillery and undamaged three cannons.
Major Water was killed by a German snowman on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Watern of 72 said that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that made me humble."
He and his brother James Water also placed a crown after the parade, which was indicated by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Watern said that he "was very pleased to participate in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people underlines the true heroism."
MMA fan was up all night to see Bellator 206, but got instead Gurli Gris
Imagine that you've been up all night to see the starry Bellator 206 and then you'll be refused to see the main event.
There were 13 matches on the program from San Jose, including six matches on the main program, and they were shown overnight in England on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the sights in England were somewhat surprised when the transmission changed to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimposed, after they had stayed awake until the early morning of this battle.
A Twitter fan described the shift to a childish movie as "a sort of sick joke."
"In accordance with the legislation, this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m., why they had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Bellator, when he was asked about the issue.
"'Grisen Gurli', yes.'
Bellator's Managing Director, Scott Coker, said that they would work to include English viewers in planning in the future.
"When you think about the re-send, I think we can make it work," Coker said.
"But the hour is six Sundays tomorrow over there, and we don't find a solution to it before Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the case.
Believe me, when it was changed, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But that was actually the law.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We just had five fights instead of six, which we usually do, and we tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had "minor value" over sexuality
The Olympic diving Tom Daley says he felt less worth than everyone else in his upbringing because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said it didn't work out for him before he came into the major classes, that "everybody isn't like me."
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about homosexual rights to give other "hope".
He also said that he was less likely to win OL after becoming a parent.
The usual host of the long-term radio programme, Kirsty Young, has taken off for a few months because of the disease.
Daley was a guest in Laverne's first program and said that he felt "less worth" than everyone else in his growth, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "From this day forward, the feelings of being worth remembering and feeling differently have been the things that have given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they learned his sexuality to know.
The double Olympic bronze winner has become a highly profiled LGBT fighter and used its participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for a criminalisation of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences, and he wanted to give others hope.
The three-fold world champion said he was "surprising" when he fell in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Last year, Daley married Oscar, who is 20 years older than him, but told me that the age difference had never been a problem.
He told me that it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar up and downturns when you go through so much at such a young age – he took to his first OL as a 14-year-old, and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June, the couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "his whole perspective" had changed".
"If you had asked me last year, it would be all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 as a 40-year-old after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they had received tickets to London in 2012 – when he was going to sit on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't be there by then.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and it first went up to me that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in OL 2012 and won the bronze.
"I only knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life – to appear in front of a home audience at OL. There was nothing that could beat that feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration of his first song selection – Proud of Heather Small – which had meant a lot during the recording of OL and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Unsharp Mickelson on the bench for Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson puts a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th fight in Ryder Cup, but he's gonna do something about it if it's not gonna be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who maintains record for 12 times in competition every 2 years, was put on the bench of Captain Jim Furyk because of the master's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the U.S. center of events as usual, the five-double champion had to work hard and practice his game in the hope of correcting the scams.
Even at the top of his career, he had the most just drive, why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match for the course at Le Golf National, where the long rough often punishs wild shot.
And if the track wasn't a big enough mouthful, Mikkelson at the ninth match on Sunday must meet the always precise winner of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who has met with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who start the 12 single fights, start strong, Mikkelson's fight can be crucial.
Fury did not express surprise confidence in his teammate.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a kick on my back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
"He has a great faith in himself."
He is in Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams before – and also this week.
I guess I didn't think he was gonna play two matches.
I imagined he'd play more, but that's how it went, and that's how it would be.
He wants to be out there like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson Nick Faldo beats record for most of the games played in Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely been able to measure itself with his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven unresolved, even though Fury said that his presence contributes to something inexhaustible.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, white, he likes to go to people, and he's good to have in the room," he explained.
"I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than the game."
Captain Thomas Bjørn of Europe knows that a great deal can quickly disappear
European Captain Thomas Bjørn knows from experience that a solid lead before the last day of Ryder Cups single-set can quickly become nervous.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but was just getting ahead of the goal line with a victory of 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice drive in Valderrama, we had a nice drive in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we just just got water," says Bjørn after seeing the 2018 team win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday to a total drive of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
It's supposed to be full-blown tomorrow.
Go out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win the trophy, and that's where our focus is.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are also aware of what is on the other side – the best golfers in the world."
Satisfied with the performances of his players on a hard track, the Bear added: "I don't take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow, it's the individual performances that count, and it's something else.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it goes well, but when you're out there alone, you're tested on all the parameters that play golf.
That's what players need to understand – get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you're gonna leave your partner, because he's gonna get the best out of himself."
Otherwise, it looks like the opponent Jim Furyk who hopes for better individual performances than in the partner game with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Fury himself has experienced covens on the last day. First on the Brooklyn win team before he lost, when Europe made "Miraklet on Medina".
"I remember every word," he said when he was asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had spoken to his players before the last day.
"We have 12 major fights tomorrow, but you would like to have a good start, as you saw at Brooklyn, as you saw at Medina.
When the moment has found a direction, it puts a great pressure on the middle struggles.
We put our team together in relation to it and put the players on the track in the order we feel. We're trying to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the back and confront Rory McIlroy in the top fight, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players in this order, because I think it assures us all the way through," Bjørn said about his choice of single players.
Germany's new warships are being postponed again
The German fleet's latest fleet was to be ready in 2014 to replace warships from the cold war, but the Germans must wait at least a year for yet another reason for technical problems and an escalating price, local media writes.
The introduction of the largest ship in the entirely new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been extended to the first half of 2019 according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military speaker.
The ship was supposed to be part of the fleet in 2014, but compliance problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, are to replace the old fryers of the Bremen class.
If they are known to have a strong cannon, a large range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as stealth technologies, as well as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the latest freighters is a smaller need for maintenance: it should be possible to have the freighters away from the ports for up to two years.
But the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which, according to Germany, will make it appear as an overseat power factor – will already be obsolete when they are inserted, Die Zeit writes.
The failed F125-freight created headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss workshop in Hamburg.
It was the first time the ship delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Not much was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of critical "software and hardware errors", which made the warship useless in combat situations.
Software error was of particular importance when the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were to be controlled by a crew of 120 sailors – that is only half of the crew of the older Bremen fleets.
It also showed that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the fleet's ability for future updates.
The 7,000 tons of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition, hardware error is the price of the project, which includes training the crew, also by becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a dwindling €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), with an initial price of €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest fregats are even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's fleet is crashing.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Government's Defence Committee, earlier this year admitted that the fleet "runs dry for clear landing vessels."
The officer said that the problem had grown over time because the old ships were taken out of use without being replaced.
He complained that none of the coolers from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Flag Mouse
New research from an area in the Scottish Highlands is trying to reveal how flag mice use the landscape when they hunt.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the behavior of the unique, flying mammals and will help in the work of future conservation efforts.
The study is carried out by scientists from Scotland's National Trust and is followed by regular flags, dwarf flags, long-term flags and water flags at Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at carefully selected locations in the area to record the activities of bats during the season.
Data from staff from NTS and volunteers will also be collected using hand-held detectors.
In-depth analysis of the audio recordings will reveal the frequencies of the flag muscles and show what kind of action they are doing.
To produce a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour, there is a report and a map of the habitat.
Nature conservation advisor for NTS Rob Dewar hopes that the results reveal which areas of habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help determine the benefits of habitat conservation efforts, such as the establishment of meadows, and the best way to preserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of flags in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen dramatically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect the shipyards and reduce their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger. The same may be the flue traps, chemical treatment of building materials and attacks from pets.
The flag must not be blind.
But because they primarily hunt at night, their ears are more usable than their eyes.
They use an advanced ecolocation technique to find insects and fly without obstacles.
NTS, which is responsible for the conservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major ports and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes flag mouse very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect gossip and sometimes perform rescue actions.
The organisation has even made Scotland's first and only dedicated flag museum reserve in the area around Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten of Scotland's flag species.
The area's merchant, David Thompson, says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Thrave we have a really good area for flag-mouse," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitat.
There is a lot of people who don't know about bats, so working here and elsewhere can help them understand what they need to do."
He stresses the importance of looking for flag mice before doing maintenance tasks on property, as the destruction of a single row can kill up to 400 females and young people, thus risking the elimination of a whole local population.
The flag must be peaceful, and it is illegal to kill, generate or disturb them or their speech.
Elizabeth Ferrell, who is the Scottish project leader for Bat Conservation Trust, has invited the public to give a hand with it.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our flag muscle, and too many of the species we have, we don't know how the populations develop."
Ronaldo rejects charges of rape, while lawyers are indicting German journals.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called charges of rape against him for "fake news" and says that people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news media Der Spiegel, who brought the charges.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of having raped an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he paid her $375.000 to keep it secret, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
Some hours after the claims had been published, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticised the information to be "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-double winner of Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"They will promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be famous for saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and everything's good," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the accusations they have called “an indisputable publication of suspicions about the private sphere of life”, according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz says that the player would seek compensation for "moral corruption in a class similar to the accusation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The event was reportedly taking place in June 2009 in a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting each other at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he was to have raped her anal according to the report submitted in the town of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said that he was "a good 99% of the time" grabbed by "one percent".
The paper claims that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and was photographed her injuries at a hospital, but that she later went to an agreement outside the court because she felt "fear for recovery" and worried about being "publicly ashamed".
The 34-year-old now says that she will violate the agreement, since she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was facing a shift from Manchester United to Real Madrid, where the event would have taken place, and moved in summer to the Italian Grand Club Juventus for 100 million €.
Brexit: Britain "will always regret" losing car manufacturers
Britain 'will regret it forever', if it lost its status as world-leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Business Minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was 'disquieting' that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily reduce production at the factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting time at the border in the case of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Toyotas Auris and Avensis factory produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, where 90% of them were exported to the rest of the EU.
"As I see it, production will stop at our factory if the UK smokes out of the EU at the end of March," said the Managing Director at Burnaston, Marvin Cooke.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are afraid to leave the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says they will close their mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain in the event of an out-of-contract departure.
Toyota's production is running on a strict schedule, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems could arise at the border which, according to the car industry, could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's production at the Derbyshire factory, and then production would be stopped, the company said.
Clark says that Theresa Mays Chequers' plan for future negotiations with the EU is "composed to avoid these checks at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that not only allows us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The statements by Toyota and other manufacturers indicate that we need to be able to continue what has been a successful supply chain."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term higher prices would reduce the competitiveness of the factory, which would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is a fellow worker at the factory, says that his members are becoming more and more concerned: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappears, they will not come again."
A spokesman for the government said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with the Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein can "be spent a week more", as set out around the high-ranking board of directors Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein, the special prosecutor Robert Mueller, is looking at the debtor during his investigation of Russian electoral interference, relations between Trump's assistants and Russia and the President's possible obstruction of the court's proceedings.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Minister of Justice and thereby risk Mueller's independence has been a slaughter site in Washington for a month.
The New York Times earlier this month wrote that Rosenstein was considering carrying a microphone to record talks with Trump and the possibility of putting the president on the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and the back went on to say he would quit.
Instead, we agreed on a Thursday meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would "do not prefer" to Mr Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed in order to avoid a collision with the Senate's judicial committee, where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault, were to testify.
On Friday Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation of the allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate's election.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed for a week with all that is happening in the high school.
But we have to see, and I like to always keep the press up to date."
Some journalists would challenge this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The guard, Chris Wallace, asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press meetings was not because of TV journalists' game for the gallery, but added: "I don't disagree that they play up to the camera."
She said that the direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president is asking more questions from the press than any president before him," she said and added without quoting a source: "We have seen the figures."
Press meetings will still take place," Sanders said, but "if the press is able to ask the President of the United States direct questions, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We are trying to give it a rich chance, and you have seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it will be in place of the press meeting when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open hearings or press meetings with high guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why, when he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the present journalists.
Minister of Health Contacts EU members of the Scottish Health Service after Brexit Concerns
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS in order to express the country's gratitude and desire to remain behind Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than a half year before Britain withdraws from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to paying for applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer, the negotiations between the UK and the EU on exit continued, and it seems that decisions are expected for the autumn.
But the British government has also increased their preparation for a Brexit, if any, without an agreement.
I know it must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the effort each employee has made, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from and outside the EU come with valuable experiences and competences that strengthen and improve health care for the benefit of patients and local communities.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we would like you to stay.
Christian Abercrombie gets acute surgery after major injury
The lineback from Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie, was rapidly operated after having suffered a slight major damage to Vanderbilt Commodores from Tennessee's Mike Organ at 31-27 December.
First coach for Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the event took place before the break.
"He went out to the sideline and just fell out there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie air on the sideline before putting him on a bar and taking him into further examination.
A spokesperson from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie's operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that "there are no details of the type or extent of the damage yet", and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when he committed the damage.
Abercrombie is studying for the second year and is starting with her first season in Tennessee State after a change from Illinois.
He had five tattles on Saturday before he left the match, which gives him 18 tattles collected this season.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp tax when buying houses in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers are charged a higher stamp fee when they purchase a property in the United Kingdom. The extra money is to help the homeless according to the conservative party.
This move must dampen Corby's success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp tax will hit those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to get £120 million per year to the homeless.
Theresa May today will propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp tax when purchasing properties in the United Kingdom for the benefit of the homeless.
The draft will be considered as an attempt to respond to Jeremy Corby's success by attracting young voters with promises of cheaper housing and following them with the highest income.
The increase in the stamp tax will cover people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The extra charge imposed above the current stamp tax and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-home purchases and purchases for rent may be up to 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to raise £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by people living abroad, which makes prices rise and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "spice villages" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new bill will only come weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in the stamp tax to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies to keep the property prices up by buying reasons they do not use. He asked May to drop the quotas on cheap homes to solve the "defeated housing situation" of the United Kingdom.
Corbyn has proposed a striking series of housing reforms, including the control of rental prices and the withdrawal of the option of the lessor to put people on the street if they comply with the rental contract.
He will also strengthen the possibility of public housing.
May said: "Last year I said that I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life will be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our non-functional housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who will live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy dwellings as hard-working British.
Too many are dreaming of having a home too far, and the worthlessness of sleeping on the street is still too widespread."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become Scotland's coach"
Chief of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "ultimate goal" is at a time to become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old team enjoys the challenge of re-launching the North East Club, which now has a third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after looking back at the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a fight with the B team, and that's it," said Ross BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland at Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it has always drawn me.
However, it would only happen if I succeed in training clubs."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coach are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach for Alloa Athletic says he had no concerns about following such established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I'm measuring success if 'I can get this club back to Premier League.'
From the structure and facilities of this club, it is definitely home to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I'll just see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years in the career that trains after a period as assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart's training staff.
Then he helped Alloa come back after being pulled down in the third best order and transformed St. Mirren from the downturn to the title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more fit now than he ever did during his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real divorce," he remembers about the time in Alloa.
"I honestly thought that training was the right thing for me, more right than being a player.
That sounds strange because I did it well, earned wisely, and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There are a lot of things you have to go through on a weekly basis.
There's still the kind of stress and pressure that coaches, but it just feels right.
I've always wanted to practice, and now I'm doing it. I haven't had it any more comfortable with myself in my adult life."
You can hear the entire interview at Sportsound on Sunday 30 September at Radio Scotland between 12 noon and 1 p.m. BST.
The best time for a beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., shows the investigation
The heat wave this summer has increased the profit for the English public, but has placed restaurant chains under greater pressure.
The sale of pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while the sale of restaurants decreased by 4.8%, shows figures.
Peter Martin, a company consultant at CGA who has collected the figures, said: "Continually, sunshine and England’s unexpected long VM have meant that July follows June’s patterns, where the pubs experienced surplus sales of 2.8 %, except that the restaurants are more hit now.
The fall of 1.8% in restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars with focus on the sale of drinks did it well and experienced progress corresponding to the downturn of the restaurants.
Pubs with focus on food in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
It looks like people just want something to drink.
across pubs and bars, the sale of beverages increased by 6,6 % per month, while the food dropped by 3,3 %."
Paul Newman, who analyzes the service industry, said: "The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales on the out-of-home market, the weather and large social or sports events are the main factors.
It is no surprise that the restaurants are still struggling, even though a drop in sales of 4.8% year after year will do a really bad thing above rising costs.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will show if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will give a hard-pressed mood."
The total increase in sales total for pubs and restaurants including new openings was 2,7 % in July, which shows the decline in newly started fires.

Every fifth child has a secret account on social media that they hide for their parents
Every fifth child, down to 11 years of age, has secret accounts on social media, which they hide from their parents and teachers, shows research.
A study of 20,000 school students in 4-9 classes reveals growth in "false Insta" pages.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content is being added
20% of students said they have a "main account", which they can show their parents
Every five children down to 11 years of age create social media accounts that they hide for adults.
A study of 20,000 students from 4th grade and forward reveals violent growth in the "False Insta" account – a reference to the screenshot service Instagram.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content will be added.
20% of students said they have a "main account", which they can show their parents, while they also have private ones.
A mother who fell over her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, so a teenager who called on others to "wake me."
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistress' Conference (HMC) for private schools found that 40% of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to having private accounts.
The leader of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "It is scary that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where their parents and teachers cannot find them.
Elid Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" in the board of Scottish Athletics.
Elid Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most winning athletes, and President Ian Bettie described the change as a good opportunity for those who make decisions on sport to benefit from her great 10-year experience at international level.
"Eilid enjoys great esteem in the athletic world in Scotland, the UK and the rest of the world, and we are sure that the athletes in Scotland will benefit from getting her into the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to try to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope that I can contribute and help out in the direction of sport in Scotland."
The American, who won two of his four OL gold medals in the 200- and 400-metre courses at OL in Atlanta in 1996, and who is now often a commentator for BBC, could not follow a transitional ischemic attack.

I couldn't go.
The doctors said that the time would show if I would get over it and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I am fast, I have learned to go back and do agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for breast pump comparing mothers with cows gets mixed reception online
A breast pump company has shared opinions online with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first soundless breast pump", the technological consumer magazine has published a sarcastic music video-inspired advertisement that will show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers.
Four true mothers dance in a costume filled with fur, to a song in which it says: "Yes, I paint myself, but you see no tail" and "If you hadn't noticed it, it's not here much more, it's my breasts."
"Fuck it out, pump it out, pump it out, pump it out, pump it out, pump it out, paint my beard."
But the advertisement, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has led to controversy online.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received a mixed reception from the viewers. Many say it makes fun of the "fears" in the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and fed before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth," one user wrote.

Another wrote: "I understand quite traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump to mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added: "such an insensitive advertisement."
Others defended the commercial, one woman admitted that she thought the song was "incredibly funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I'd still been married, I'd have had one.
Amning made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a genius product," wrote one.
Another commented: "It's a fun advertisement directed at mothers who pump milk (often at their place of work or at toilets) and feel like 'sweet'.
It is not a advertising that praises or criticises the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their bies.
The concept behind the ad is based on that many women who are adamant say they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely soundless, has no pipes or hoses and fits discreetly in an amme-bh, which gives women freedom to move, hold their children and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, who is partner and director of Mother, wrote: "The pump from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between breast-feeding mothers and dairy cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping, while we demonstrated in a entertaining and recognizable way the freedom that the new pump can give."
This is not the first time that the pump from Elvie has created headlines.
In London Fashion Week, a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Several hundred migrant children secretly moved to tents at Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has exploded, although the number of border guards has not changed.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they are afraid of being able to stay in the country by standing up and accepting a child.
The risk of home delivery increased in June when the authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household should print their fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified to the Congress and told them that they had arrested several persons who sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The management subsequently confirmed that 70 % of those arrested had purely criminal certificates.
"Approximately 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of the sponsors' households are illegally staying in the country, and a large proportion of them are foreign criminals.
So we keep chasing those people," said Albence.
In an attempt to treat children's cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to meet in court within a month of their detention.
Many use video calls instead of meeting up and talking about their case for legal residence to an immigration judge.
Those who are sentenced to invalidity shall be deported quickly.
The longer children are in custody, the higher the probability is that they will get anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outcomes or affluence, it is reported by auxiliary workers and in reports from the system in recent months.
People who advocate for better conditions say that these risks are more pronounced on larger facilities such as Tornillo, where the size makes it harder to keep an eye on the suffering of a child.
They added that moving to a tent village without mental preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to friends can bring up traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria informs American, French and Turkish "commitment forces" that they must withdraw immediately
When Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem spoke to the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is now at its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the residence of foreign forces in the country is illegal and under the pretext of combating terrorism, and they will "be met with equivalent funds."
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war against terrorism "is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this crucial war until we have cleared all Syrian areas" for both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, primarily coaching and advising Kurdish and Syrian-Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-stricken country.
In the area of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were good enough for them to return home, after which he accused "some Western countries" of "distribution of unwarranted fear", which led the refugees to get away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help facilitate these domestic shipments," he said.
"They're policing what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the EU have warned that no help will be provided to rebuild the country before there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
On the basis of the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack by the Syrian forces, supported by Russia, was avoided against the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would go after the jihadists from Nusrafront, a group of runners from Al-Qaeda, who "will be eliminated".
The UN mission Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of the new committee to write a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for a elections.
Moualem has put the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee and says that the work of the panel should be limited to "to review the legislation of the current Constitution", and warned against interference.
That's why Trump wins another presidential period.
From that logic, Trump is likely to be re-elected in 2020, unless the rule of law and scandals end his presidential period before time, which many liberals hope for.
In what is undoubtedly going to be "the most dramatic conclusion of a presidential period ever!"
At present, there is no sign of visual fatigue.
Since 2014, viewers have been almost doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best transmission time compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBCs The Rachel Maddow Show has most viewers up to 3.5 million at night with big news.
"It's a show that people are attracted to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the ABC Drama Designated Survivor about a leader of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy author and author behind "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snaging Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a tax trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote on Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh," said Scovell.
The chaos has entertainment value.
However, unlike all other TV programs, the stories coming from Washington can decide whether Roe and Wade can be restored and the health of the world economy.
Changing the channel is only the most privileged.
And yet it's about more than being informed citizens when you see six hours of panel debate where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background", when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's strud leather jacket for $15,000 ("clothed with hybrids", wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniel's living descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
Anyway, I never want to see Super Mario the same way.
"Some of what makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, managing director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's rotating crew and daily surprises (screaming with N.F.L, rose to Kim Jong-un.)
But if you miss a section, you're off.
When I got caught in Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and then MSNBC, while he took CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was to be heard in the Senate's judicial committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was to be decided.
"I remember when we made all these crazy shows before, and people said, 'It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large sums find the way to the close mid-term selection of the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania 17 district receives large sums of money. As a result of an equalization of two Congressional Districts, two members of the Congressional District fight for the same seat.
This recently surrounded urban district in Pittsburgh creates problems for the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb stands up against another member of Congress, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which is heavily overlapped by the new 17.
The cards were remanded, after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January, judging that the old district was legally placed in favour of the Republicans.
The fight for the new 17th district has begun a fight on financial resources between the committees of the major parties, the Congressional Committee of Democrats (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a choice with high surveillance in March's specialty of Pennsylvania 18th district.
The seat has been on the Republicans' hands for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a small benefit.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but redefined itself
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners threw Trump's management team out.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call leading US diplomats back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the foreign ministry's spokeswoman in a statement earlier this month.
But it was only El Salvador who was punished. They received about $140 million from the United States in 2017 for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts of economic aid and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials launched a summit on security and economic development, which should have continued last year's meeting, which is considered to be a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, the top Bed people made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway, and thus dropped their thoughts on punishment for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence must speak to the conference scheduled for mid-October in order to send a signal of the importance the Americans place in the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three US envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard demands or punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson for Bolton from the White House did not wish to comment on the details of the case described by three American officials, including two diplomats who would like to talk about internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the basis of a condition of anonymity.
Unknown history
The next obstacle could well be the special prosecutor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstruction of the investigation, which is considerable and publicly available evidence.
According to him, Mueller will also investigate the question of whether Trump's campaign secretly cooperated with Russia on the attack on the election.
If the Congress were to come to new hands, Trump would likely be held responsible while he is preparing to meet again the electorate and, of course, a jury of his companions.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not claim that Trump's finality is inevitable – and the same applies to his opponents in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
In 1938, German officials were ready to put in a coup against Hitler if only the West could resist him by supporting the Czech Slovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the long bloodbath afterwards.
It is about such turning points that the axis of history is rotating, and the irreversible march of democracy is increasing or decreasing.
In the United States, there are now many of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who decides the future for Mueller's investigation, Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been hot, since the present newspaper was able to announce that he had proposed last year to make hidden recordings of the president and challenged his suitability for the office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' production is inaccurate.
"How do we react if Brett Kavanaugh's recently requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is set up or not properly implemented – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court in spite of credible charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And, more importantly, will we vote in the mid-term vote for a convention that will hold Trump responsible?
If we fail these tests, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime itself, who once owned my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath light on the table with the garden cross.
How can I be anything but optimistic about it in the trunk?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic about the battle against SK Rapid Wien
Rangers take on Thursday against SK Rapid Wien. After the impressive unresolved results in Spain against Villareal earlier this month, with a victory against the Austrians, they will have good opportunities to get further from Group G of the Europa League.
A cracker prevented the middle stage player Graham Dorrans from getting the season start before the 2-2 fight against Villareal, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a jumpboard for something even bigger.
"It was a good point for us, because Villareal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the fight with the belief that we could get something home, and we got a point.
Maybe we could have gone home, but all in all, that was quite a result.
They were probably the best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and was the best team.
On Thursday, another big European evening will be over.
We hope to get three points, but it's going to be hard because they got a good result in the last fight, but with the audience behind us, I'm sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
Last year has been hard because of everything that has happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but the vote is good now.
The hold is good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can drive now, put the last season behind us and get success."
Fear of pension savings makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the study participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to get used to it, there were only a few who talked to the family about it.
About half of the participants in the National Wire survey said that they discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% told them that they were talking to their children about it.
"Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do anything to start the conversation," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Insurance Company.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not tell them in good time about your wishes.
Use your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices can be crucial factors for the costs.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term care can, among other things, be financed through traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payment or self-insurance with your own funds – as long as you have an economy to do so.
Get the legal documents in order: Take the legal battles in the race.
Get a full power so you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure that doctors and nurses comply with your wishes, in case you cannot communicate yourself.
Consider, too, an economic force.
In that case, you shall designate a trusted person who can make economic decisions and ensure that your bills are paid if you do not have the opportunity to do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that one of your elderly parents is in urgent need of medical attention and is on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Get all these details down in writing, so you're ready.
"It is not just a question of the economy – who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicine?
Who fits the dog?
Get the plan in place."
Man shot several times with air rifles in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a tour of the city.
The victim was in the '40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, middle floor and hand.
The officer describes the shooting, which took place around 02.30, as "very random."
The victim didn't see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police call for witnesses to stand up.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Since the communication routes are out of play, emergency relief workers have not been able to receive information from the Donghala Regent, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated, after the earthquake struck.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donghala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulawesi and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city celebrated 40-year anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Dongala is a regent that extends over 300 km of coastline on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
In 2017, the regency, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basic pillars of the Central Sulawes economy, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickelluding is also important in the province, but mainly takes place in Morowali, which is the opposite of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia’s disaster centre, Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
In 1996, Dongala was struck again by a tsunami that killed you.
Indonesia is seismologically on the so-called Great War in the Pacific and is hit by earthquakes on a regular basis.
Some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian Aceh province of northern Sumatra triggered on 26 December a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean Coast, including over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake measuring 6,8 hit south of Java, Indonesia’s most densely populated island, and triggered a tsunami that swept across the south coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A earthquake measuring 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands out of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake hit Pidie Jaya's regency in Aceh and spread destruction and panic, as the population was reminded of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
A tsunami was not triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by the invading buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquake hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left several thousand tourists temporarily on the beach.
Sarah Palin's Oldest Son for Domestic Violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor in Alaska and vice-president Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska was arrested after suspicion of domestic violence, prevention of domestic violence and in order to resist arrest, according to the report sent on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he received the phone from a woman who was familiar when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is a custody prison in Mat-Su Pretial Facility with a deposit of $500 without security, reports KTUU.
He was put before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "very innocent", reports the network.
Palin is targeted for three Class A violations, which can lead to a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been targeted for a Class B violation that can lead to a punishment on a single day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been targeted for violations of law.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently being handled by Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was targeted at domestic violence, preventing the notification of a violent crime in the home and the possession of weapons in an affected state in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of giving her a blow in her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups after explaining her son's violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his deployment in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: several hundred dead
At least 384 people died, after an earthquake on Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi hit.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed several hundred homes.
The area is without electricity and communication routes, and the number of dead is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit south of the central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On the social media there are videos that show the moment when the earthquake strikes.
Several hundred people were gathered to a beach party in the city of Palu, when the tsunami was facing the coast.
Public prosecutors are trying to get terrorist suspects in NYC with rare death sentences.
Public prosecutors are trying to be sentenced to death to Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of terrorist attacks in New York City, who killed eight people – a rare sentence, which was finally sentenced to a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov reportedly used a rental car from the construction market Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who came in the way were killed.
As a basis for the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intensely" killed the eight victims and "intendedly" caused serious personal injury, which is required by the declaration of intent for the death penalty in the southern district of New York.
According to the legal document, death penalty is a possible result of both of these purposes.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury was able to present Saipov for a 22-point attack, including eight charges of murder in gang crime, typically used by public prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "comprehensive planning and preparation", the prosecutors said and described Saipov's execution as "unfair, wicked and depravated."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, bodily injury and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement says.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York's southern district last travelled in a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but ended up being sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was later pronounced in a state case in New York in 1953. Then the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced to espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple was executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov came from Uzbekistan and, according to the legal documents, showed no sign of any indication in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was doing well.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag up in his hospital room, told the officers.
He has denied himself guilty in 22 points of the indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that they "of course were disappointed" about the accused's decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and lifelong prison sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s defenders had previously asked the accused not to go after the death penalty.
Conservative Minister believes that NIGEL FARAGE should take over the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the public head" during a demonstration at the conservative meeting today.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians could be "marked" by the Eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May's own ministers had stated that Farage should take over the negotiations with the EU.
The many conservative MP Peter Bone said to the demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have "be out now" if Farage had been Brexit negotiator.
May’s challenge to create a collection in the deeply divided party is emphasized by the participation of conservative remnants in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to maintain his compromise plan on the track during attacks by both brexites, remnants and the EU.
Her allies insist that despite the backdrop, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – thus forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or "chaos".
To the demonstration Leave Means Leave in Solihull, Bone announced that he wanted to disrupt the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had the responsibility, we would have been out now," he said.
The Minister of Wellingborough added, "I'm going to fight for Brexit, but we're going to screw up the Chequers."
On the basis of his EU resistance, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be subordinates.
We will determine our own laws in our own country."
Bone refused that the public's position should have changed since the vote in 2016: "If the British people had changed their mind and wished to be in the European Union, it was absolutely wrong."
The conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told the journalists: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is unpopular in the broad population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the street and get us elected.
Drop the Chequers now, and start listening.'
As a tip to May, she added: "Ministers keep their job when they keep their promises."
Farage told us that politicians should be able to "mark the press" if they failed the decision of the vote in 2016.
"Now it is a question of trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They'll betray Brexit, but we're together to tell them that we won't let them go."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "You must ensure that the political class who is on the verge of betraying Brexit can feel the pressure.
"We will mobilize the people here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until we have become an independent, self-ruled and proud UK."
Imens marched through Birmingham before a totem took up in the middle of the city.
Scattered activists fanned with Conservative Mod Brexit banners after forming the group this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis did before the meeting laughs at the security problems with the conservative party app.
"It is the people who claim that they have control over the IT systems and technology of Canada, border controls, free trade without borders in Ireland," he said.
"It's totally funny.
There's nothing called a good Brexit," he added.
Warren "thinks strongly" to set up the presidential election
Member of the House of Representatives Senator Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly to stand up to the presidential election" after the mid-term election in November.
According to Boston Globe, the democrat from Massachusetts spoke of his future during a city council meeting on Saturday in the Western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticised Donald Trump, will try in November to re-election the state’s Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired at Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It has been speculated whether she would challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting at Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the electors at the councilhouse, since Trump took over the office.
One participant asked her if she was planning to resign to the presidential election.
Warren replied that it's time for "women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it requires a woman in front."
Arrest in the case of firearms at LSU's Sims
The Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that on Friday a suspect was arrested for shooting at Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player.
The Baton Rouge police reported that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested on Friday at an ET news meeting at 11.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday to ask for help in identifying a man on the footage.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and killed by the injuries," said police chief Murphy J. Paul, according to media 247 sports.
Wayde took action to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been present in possession of a weapon and to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and is now in police custody in the East Baton Rouge District.
Sims was a two-metre high third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. In the last season he played 32 matches, started in 10 and played on average 17.4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the World Championship, after teams give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment that Valteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a crucial role in the race.
From the driver's position, Bottas got a good start and was about to hang Hamilton completely when he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove in the pit as the first one, and let Hamilton fight the traffic at the back of the field, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes car went into the pit a little later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back in front, as the Ferrari driver had to leave the interior after a double defence at a third turn after some wheel contact.
Max Verstappen started from the rear row and was number seven after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he led in a large part of the race, when in an attempt to get a quick finish he failed to change the tyres to take the fourth seat of Kimi Raikkonen.
He had to go into the pit of the 44th round, but could not increase the pace of the last eight rounds, why the Raikkonen secured the square.
"It's a hard day, because Valteri did it amazing all weekend and really was a gentleman when he let me pass.
The holding made an incredible amount of work to ensure both the first and second places," Hamilton said.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump urged Senator Diane Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday, because she insisted that she had not closed the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the high-level nominated Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a election meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention the testimony that Ford had given before the U.S. Senate's judicial committee, but instead said that the events in the Senate showed that people were "unrighteous and hostile and dishonest".
"The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and wicked and hostile and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at statements and play, and then they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember that?
Diane Feinstein, was that you who cut it off?
Remember her answer... it was you who closed the document – "oh, uh, what?
No, no.
I haven't closed anything."
Hey, hold on a second.
No, we haven't, we haven't, we haven't, we haven't," he added in an imitation of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter on Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was closed earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's allegations, and I haven't closed her story," Feinstein told the committee according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I did."
But her rejection was not well received by the President, who said during the election of the Lord's electorate: "I tell you that it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
During the President's continued defence of the appointed judge to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, Trump proposed that the Democrats use the charges to benefit their own cause.
"They don't throw any money into their efforts to take back power.
You can see the evilness, the contradictions, they don't care who they're supposed to fool in order to get power and control," the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars did it again well after Friday's Elite League's losing battle against Belfast Giants by winning the return campaign 5-3 in Dundee this Saturday.
Giants arrived quickly in front of two targets with attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were balanced on the home street before Dwyer brought Giants in front.
Francois Bouchard matched Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat of Adam Keef's team, which came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in the Friday battle in Belfast.
It was the fourth session of the season between the sides where Giants went out as conquerors in the three previous battles.
Dwyer left for the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assistant from Kendall McFaul with David Rutherford as assistant, when Beauvilleer doubled the lead four minutes later.
During a busy first period, Sullivan returned home to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt was behind Cownie's compensation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure Giants came forward at the first break when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The household regrouped, and Bouchard re-equipped with a nice goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen drive Dundee ahead for the first time in the fight late in the second period, and he secured the winner with the team's fifth goal halfway through the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four out of their five matches, are home in Milton Keynes for their next match on Friday.
Aeroplanes died to ensure that hundreds of passengers avoided earthquakes
A pilot in Indonesia is hailed as a whole after he died to ensure that a plane with several hundred passengers was safely landed on the ground.
More than 800 people are dead and many are missing, after a major earthquake in Friday hit the island of Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still increasing the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agungs colleagues fled for life, he refused to leave his seat in the waving control tower in Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He was back in his seat to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was held on the runway, was safe in the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was getting along.
He died at the hospital later.
Speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said according to Australian ABC News that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're sons-in-law," he added.
The authorities are afraid that the death rate can reach several thousand, and the country's disaster preparedness announces limited access to the towns of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The figure is expected to rise, because there are still many bodies in the ruins, and it is not possible to get to them," said the speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, which conducts a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial flights emergency assistance and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to Sky News: "Every minute a new ambulance comes with several bodies.
There's a lack of clean water.
All the stores are ruined."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we do not know what we are coming to.
It's already a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work around the clock to perform all the duties related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" he said according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombrok earlier this year, where more than 550 people died.
Flight control in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man misses the flight control in the lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says that a man is missing, although it had previously been reported that all 47 passengers and crew members were evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini states that on Saturday afternoon it could not locate a male passenger.
The airline informed that it cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned to requests for more information about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Locals were both helping to save the other passengers and crew, after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said Friday that seven people were driving to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were at the hospital until Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is still not clear what caused the steering and the precise order of the events.
The airline and the American Navy both state that the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very low water.
"It was really lucky," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers could go water to life to get to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the crew panicked and cried, and that he had received a minor head injury.
The U.S. Marine stated that sailors working to renovate a cask nearby also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to transport people to the country before the plane sank at about 30 metres.
Aviation Safety Network data shows that 111 people have died in an accident with PNG-registered airlines over the last two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analysts set a timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The Public Prosecutor's Office concluded its evidence on Saturday in the case of a man charged with burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analysts at the U.S. Ministry of Justice, Paul Rowlett, gave testimony for several hours as expert witnesses in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used teleinformation to combine the course of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he got location data from several different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers that night she died, which was contrary to his previous claims, writes The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time he claimed that he and his friend Michael Sanford were visiting the Sanford police.
Sanford sat in the witness hospital on Saturday and told me he was out there that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "a liar because my truck was in Nashville".
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at a time after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defence is planned to start its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that day.
The High Breed: What is political hippop?
A hipoptrio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that hippop has moved away from his origin with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to the starting point and make political hipop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Commons have recently received a revalidation in the United Kingdom because of artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Baby girl in New York sues couple after shooting with "racist" text
A New York child girl sues a couple for discrimination after having received a text message from a mother who complained that she was "another black person".
The couple denied that they were racist, but compared the cause of the case with "depression".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who is mother to two, expressed her horror at finding that the new baby girl, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEJ, NOT ENDNU A kind of person," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, she fired the "unsatisfied" Plasco-Flaxman Giselle Maurice and said that their former baby girls, from African-American, had been bad at their job and that she was expecting a Filipino, according to New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day's work and sent home in a Uber.
Giselle Maurice now sues the couple for compensation for the fire and compensation for $350 a day in the six months she was supposed to live with the family, although this was agreed without a contract.
"I would like to show them that you cannot allow yourself to do such a thing," she said to the newspaper Friday and added, "I know that it is discrimination."
The couple have defended themselves that they are not racist and that the firing of Maurice was justified because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife had come to send her something she wouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," Joel Plasco told The Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone you had been unneeded to, even though it was a mistake?
This baby?
I'm being honest."
Plasco compared the cause of the case to "pressurisation", and that his wife had been born two months before and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you really looking for someone like that?
It is not particularly helpful," the investment advisor added.
Although the case is still pending, the Court of Justice has already written down the couple on social media and shamed their behaviour and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publisher feared that readers could not relate to a speaker bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was admitted to publication, said about the letter: "It's hard to imagine being the one who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's really fun to read now when you know how popular Paddington became."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman on BBC, before he was inspired to write the children's book on a little tuxedo, would have been optimistic, even though his story was rejected, and that the 60-year-old for publishing the books was "bitter-sweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father in all modesty was proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't care about crying," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt as if you had a child who achieved something: you are proud of them, although it is not your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he used to say it was Paddington's fault."
Say goodbye to dying daughter over the phone
After the landing, her daughter was taken to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors were lost tried to save her life.
"Ned called at regular intervals to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn't survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"So I got a call from Nad that she would die in the next few minutes, and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
I'll see you again soon.
I'll see you.
The medicine she had been given to keep her heart on, slowly lost its effect.
She was dead shortly before, and now she closed her body down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to get together."
Finally, the grieving Ednan-Laperous went on board the plane with the other passengers who did not know what she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I bent my head, and the tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving Women Try to Stop Suicideers
Two women who have lost contact with suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have placed cards on a waly bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he was depressed, and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parents to experience the grief I experience every day," she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with an infected smile.
"His smile was known to everyone.
People said that his smile lit up the room."
However, he stopped working before he died because he really had it wrong.
In 2014, it was Tyler's 11-year-old brother who found him when he took his life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid if it spreads."
Sharon Davis made the cards to "tell people that there is someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don't go with your thoughts yourself – you have to talk to someone."
Sharon Davis' many-year-old friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost his girlfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about him being sorry or depressed or something," she said.
"Some days before Christmas, he began to change.
He was really far down Christmas, and when the kids opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them."
She said that his death was very traumatic for them, but that they had to get through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
It's torn us apart.
But we all have to continue and fight together."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still unsolved, while the FBI is starting an investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for – a time-limited study with limited scope – we might get a little agreement," Flake said on Saturday and added that he feared that the committee "falled from the side" in the middle of the fixed party situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republicans not support the FBI's investigation?
Their detention is due to the timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if the Republicans, as expected, fail, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to choose for the country's highest judicial office.
George W. Bush has called senators to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through it met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has finished its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known whether Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice-President Mike Pence the decisive vote and elect him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean dropouts under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean runners to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seus referred to data from the South Korea Mining Ministry and said that 1,127 runners were last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human smugglers contributed to the amended figures.
Pyongyang has not made any official comments.
In the long run, most North Korean refugees are granted citizenship in South Korea.
The South Korean Government states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest border rising up to North Korea, and which is easier to cross than the highly guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the refugees to be illegal immigrants and not refugees, so they are often forced home.
The relationship between North and South Korea – which is technically still at war – has improved significantly over the last few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met to discuss the lateral negotiations on nuclear destruction.
This takes place after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work against an atomic-free Korean on an overall level.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions on the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances it is excluded that we will be depressing ourselves," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's unfit for the high court.
The President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the Supreme Court, for "hysterical" and said that his temperament was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi's comment came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had acted that way, she would have been called hysterical," Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate's judicial committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh rejected the emotional charges that he had committed a sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he talked about his family and his years in high school, he almost cried and was crying.
He also condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the charges against him "grotesque and a coordinated character" arranged by the left wing, who was angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential post in 2016.
Pelosi said she thought that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not sit in the high court because it showed that he was prejudiced against the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with the opinions and the way he followed Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi fought outside when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh for a kingdom if he was confirmed and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say that if he does not speak truthfully against the Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, but certainly also in the court he is sitting in now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge at the Court of Appeal in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions regarding Obama's health reform or the abortion Roe v. Wade because he was considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings Kavanaugh did not answer questions as to whether he would circumvent certain previous decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, prejudiced person has to fight a job as a judge and expect us to say 'yes, it's not just nice," said Pelosio.
And women have to use it.
It is a just outcome, the anger of months and years that is coming over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal.
She continued: "I received great support from a woman who was the boss who said that she also cried when she got angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started to cry, she would tell her who she was talking to: "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she just became aware.
And I thought it was genius."
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are misunderstood.
One of my most obvious memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with a weight of men, where I often cry of anger, where I was taken by the neck of an older woman – a cold boss, whom I had always been a little afraid of – and pulled out on the stairs.
"You must never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They'll think you're sorry, and they'll be glad they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a member of the Congress of the Democrats of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was exposed to having an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and acting as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and came to the conclusion that she could just as well set up as a presidential candidate.
"It was not a particularly thoughtful decision," she said grinning to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and they certainly did not need another candidate.
Some called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was behind with fundraising, so she promised she wouldn't participate unless she collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She found out that some of her support, which gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she said that she would not stop, she was overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so hard to raise money and reach out to voters instead of voters, and anger over sexism – that she got a lump in her throat.
"You could think that I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls about how the press reacted to her.
"You should think I was sponsored by Kleinex.
I remember thinking what you're going to write on my gravestone?
"She cried"?
How the trade war between the United States and China can be a benefit for Beijing
The openings of the trade war between the United States and China were loud, and although the battle is far from over, the gap between the countries can be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing duties on important Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest scale this week with new customs duties affecting goods at a value of $200 billion applies in principle to half of all goods imported into the USA from China.
Beijing has been reimbursed every time, at the latest by charging customs duties of 5-10% on American goods for $60 billion.
China has been able to follow the United States all the way, and the world's second largest economy is probably not giving up immediately.
If it makes Washington withdraw their demands, it means they're giving up, but for China's president, Xi Jinping, it'll be too embarrassing to bow to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing is playing its cards correctly, the American pressure in the trade war can have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
"A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can create a basis for an economy that can come out of control in both countries, and it's actually much more dangerous than you thought," said Abigail Grace, research worker focusing on Asia at the Thought Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' to receive refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria says that the country is ready for refugees to return and asks for help to build the country destroyed by the more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government has continued to control the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore a normal state.
All conditions are now in place so that refugees can return to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that affected their daily lives and bread.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have fled the country since 2011, where the war began.
More than six million people still in the country need emergency assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would like to help rebuild the hardy country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe ensures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 and beat the American team 16.5 - 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six times on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophies back when Captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points, which required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had it hard in most of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake on a pair of 3 on the 16th hole, causing him to lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari managed well in all rounds and became 1 out of 4 players who have got 5-0-0 since 1979, where the current format of the tournament started.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 of the lowest ranking European players, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
No. 1 on the World Cup, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in the bag, Spain Sergio Garcia, became the most winning European of the tournament with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't do it for it.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really happy to get the faith back.
This is a maintenance effort, and I am happy to be able to help," said a sentimental Garcia after the European victory.
He sends the falcon to his countryman John Ram, who fell the American golfing Tiger Woods 2&1 on a single match Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It is a fun statistics for one of the best golfers ever who have won 14 great titles, only passed by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had all weekend problems finding the shape except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, said after his crew's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of the guys, because they fought for the case.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe a match.
We're lost.
The hatred for Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
