Members of the Wally Assembly are worried they're going 'like wet'
There is confusion among some members about the proposal that their title be changed from AM to MWP (for a Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Walloon Parliament.
Members of the political spectrum are afraid that it can trigger a ridicule.
One member of the Labour Party says his group is concerned because "it's with Twp and Pwp rhym."
For readers outside Wallis: In Wallies, twp means stupidity and pwp means relaxation.
A meeting member of the Plaid Cymru some say the group as a whole is "not happy" and suggested alternative.
A member of the Wallarian Conservative Party says his group is "inceptible" about the name change, but noted that it is a short speech from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of stupid or stupid.
In this context, the Walloon letter you like the Yorkshire English statement of the letter speaks to you.
The Committee on Meetings, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what are called Members of the Assembly will, of course, be a matter for the Members themselves."
The Law on the Government of Wallis 2017 gave the Wallish meeting the power to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that received broad support to call the meeting a Walli Parliament.
With regard to AM's title, the Commission chose Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received most approval in a consultation with the public.
AM's seeming to be proposing alternatives, but the struggle to get consensus can be a headache for the president, Elin Jones, who must present within weeks a bill on the changes.
The legislation on reforms will also include other changes to the way in which the meeting is conducted, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the draft committee system.
AM's will get the last statement in the question of what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country name
Elections will vote on Sunday whether to change their country name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The census was organized in an attempt to eliminate a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself had a province called Macedonia.
Athens has been calling for a long time already to represent the name of its neighbor in the north in his area and has repeatedly made a cap on his applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the name change, said that he would ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, however, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The clocks of St. Martin's fall silent because churches in Harlem struggle
"Historicly," said the old people I spoke to, "there was a creek and a church was on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"None of the two are there today."
He says that the disappearance of crows is understandable.
"People socialize today in other ways," he said.
"Kroots are no longer the family rooms where people go regularly."
As for churches, he is concerned that the money from sales of battles will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they are back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the type of people who will not help the neighborhood’s remaining shelters.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he said, "and that's why the day which closes up these churches will bring even closer, because most of the people who enter these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation that was close to worshiping there took over the title of the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Eerw. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who did not want to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but while Father Johnson’s members planned to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
Eww. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor to Saint Martin's, proudly called the carione "the poor people's watches".
The expert who played the cartoon in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carion in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the larger carion at the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather says St. Martin's hasn't replaced him.
What last few months at St. Martin's was a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the church's laymen, others by the Episcopal archdiocese.
The church cry, the congregation’s governing body, which consists of laymen, wrote to the bishop in July with concern that the bishop “try to pass the cost” to the church cry, although the church cry was not involved in appointing the architects and contractors who sent the bishop.
Some members of the congregation complain about a lack of transparency on the part of the church.
Hail injured 13-year-olds on bedside in California
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday and injured him on the first day of the California bedtime season, officials say.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for a half hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then pulled a group closer to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was just the excitement of a first catch, but then he realizes 'that he calls,' I was bitten!
I'm bitten!'
His whole key leg was cut open," Hammel saw when he came out to the boy.
"I called out that everyone should come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was flown to the Council Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as criticism.
It is not known which species is responsible for the attack.
Lifeguard. Larry Giles said at a media session that a shark was observed a few weeks ago in the area, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of his upper body.
Officials closed the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to expand to UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams are fighting department store-type beauty walks that are by specialist assistants.
As part of a major expansion in the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and household goods are reselling, the larger beauty steps will be tested across the country in 11 shops and if this is a success the following year will be taken to more shops.
The investment takes place in beauty while supermarkets search for ways to fill racks once used for TVs, microwaves, and household equipment.
Sainsbury's says it's going to double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which will for the first time include trades such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with trade-marked areas similar to those seen in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also launches its Boutique Grimming Series again so that the majority of products are vying-friendly - something that has increasingly younger buyers insist on.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's shops, of which the first week in Croydon opened in South London and a second which will be opened later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a move to smaller amounts of food that is bought daily at local restaurants means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive officer of Sainsbury's, said that the stores are becoming more like department stores when the supermarket chain tries to fight back with more services and non-foods against Aldi and Lidl stores.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and also published a number of Habitat sales points since it had bought both of these chains back two years, which, according to their sales, have strengthened hardware sales and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's in the early 2000s tested a joint venture with Boots, but the relationship ended up arguing how the profits from the pharmacy should be distributed within its shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's three years ago, his 281-store pharmaceutical business sold to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxurious skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's trade director, said, "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty walks to improve the environment for our customers.
We also suggested to special-level colleagues who would be at hand to offer advice.
Our range of trade names are designed to meet every need and the attractive environment and convenient locations means that we are now an area of beauty that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones' anger after Holly Willoughby withdraws £11 million agreement
Dragons Den-ster Peter Jones ran away 'suffering' after TV provider Holly Willoughby withdrew her to a £11 million match with his lifestyle branding business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their household dress and convenience trade name, True,.
The couple’s business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop trade name.
This Morning bidder, 37, announced on Instagram that she had withdrawn her.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den-ster Peter Jones angry at last by withdrawing their profitable lifestyle branding business - to focus on her own huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Bronne says Jones was "sudden" when TV's golden girl Tuesday at a tense meeting in the headquarters of his business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new opportunities -- worth £1.5 million -- meant that she could no longer spend enough time on their household clothes and convenience-trade name, True.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop trade name and would, according to a dedicated Willoughby’s famous £11 million fortune double.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she had left True, Jones climbed on a beam and traded Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source says, "Truly was Holly's greatest priority at a distance.
It would be her long - term future that would bring her through the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw her was totally stupid.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday was so close to the announcement.
There's a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters that's right to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of this Morning provider, one of Britain’s most money - making stars, the firm can hunt millions out of the bag as a result of the huge investment in products ranging from kissing and candles to clothing and household clothes, and the possibility that its publication may even encounter more delays.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin has been near Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up True in 2016 with Capp and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples have a vacation together, and Jones owns a 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a trade brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a provider of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source near Jones last night said, "We will not comment on his business."
Hard words 'and then we fall in love'
He laughed about criticism he received from the news media because he made a comment that some would view as "unpresidential" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said "new-reader voice" in his chamber.
"I gave up nothing."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first conversation in June in Singapore as a major step after the nuclear weaponization of North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear weapons were in progress.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said on Saturday, more than three months after the June summit in Singapore, leaders at the UN General Assembly said that the North did not see a "consistent reaction" of the United States to North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues with sanctions on which to keep the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view of his convention talk.
"We advance excellent with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to begin a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim resulted in positive results — ending firefight tests, helping to free cell phones, and causing the rest of American soldiers to return home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be Presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this stamped arena, we would have almost 200 people standing there," Trump said while he pointed to the crowd right before him.
Gulf and earthquake in Indonesia devastated island, hundreds dead
For example, in the course of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite for catalysing international aid.
"In many cases they were unfortunately very clear that they did not ask for international help, which made it a bit difficult," said me.
Although Save the Children are setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is not certain whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials visit the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the ongoing global warming in Indonesia, the country remains sadly weak in preparation for the wrath of nature.
While tsunamis were built in Aceh, it is not a general face to other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning sirens in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, even though it was a warning of power.
Traveling between Indonesia’s many islands is the best challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to deal with earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia's expanded infrastructure a core point of his election campaign and has spent money on roads and railways in vain.
However, Mr. Joko’s administration is being driven by lack of funding, as he looks back on his election the following year.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of closing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were kidnapped like Christian and Muslim gangs with caps, arrows, and bows, and other primitive weapons on the street.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge sprints good equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a Prime Minister's loss against Chelsea for a purpose in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri told Sturridge when he was about 30 years behind the Chelsea goal and his team was 1-0.
He pointed the ball to the left before he pushed far to the finish line.
The effort went high over the frame as it swung to the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball slammed over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and in just the case.
"It was just to try to get in that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as far as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and knock once and not think too much about it and just spit."
Chelsea was 1-0 by half time before the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute set a target.
The Blues' goalner in that play area with a backdrop played again to Mateo Kovacic before he landed near the middle field and inhaled in the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly received and reported in the middle of the field.
With a beautiful forehead, he led them to Hazard in the rampart.
Hazard passed the defense and ended up with a left foot spade near Liverpool's Alison Becker in the remotest goal.
Liverpool runs the battle against Naples at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea comes on Thursday to stand before Videoton in London at UEFA Europe League.
Double - step 832 to Indonesian tsunamis
The death toll in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami amounted to 832, the country’s disaster agency said early Sunday.
It has been reported that many people have been trapped under the rumbling of buildings that destroyed the earthquake, which struck Friday at 7.5 levels, and caused fires of up to 20 feet, the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was plundered by the ruins of ruined buildings.
Police arrest a man, 32, suspected of murder after a woman was killed
A murder investigation was sent from a pile after the body of a woman this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 a.m. in Grayson Mews in John Street with knives, and a 32-year-old man was arrested suspected of murder.
The police encouraged people in the area who had heard or seen anything to move forward.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The investigation is at an early stage, but I am calling on anyone who was in the area of John Street in Birkenhead who had seen or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
I also appeal to any, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on Dashcam film material, to contact us as they can have information that can be inexcusable to us."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe that they know the woman at the show showed up to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are continued as the police said they are in the process of illustrating the victim’s neighbors.
A taxi driver who lived in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment but was informed by the police that no one was allowed into or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Citizens are now told that it will take hours before they are reincarnated.
It has been heard that a police officer tells one man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears on the scene.
She repeatedly said, ‘ It’s so disgusting. ’
At 2 nm there were two police cars inside the cordon with another car just outside.
A number of officers have been placed within the cordon to monitor the block's habitats.
Anyone with information is asked to link @MerPolCC to DM, 101 or link Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of 30 September as reference.
Parliament's Statute of Cromwell is becoming the newest monument with a 'rewriting of history' dispute
His banning will be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "society" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of the statutes that the shape of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be a target.
The imagery of the English civil wars was either ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the deeds of his forefather Thomas in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s mundane depiction of Cromwell was evidence of 19th century’s opinion and part of the history of a figure that many still believe to be memorable.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is being seen by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of the parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate representation is the subject of continued historical debate.
What is determined is that the conflict of the middle 17th century gave shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as Protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Chinese Boer Homicide
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China.
The man, who was only identified by his, "Yuan," was found dead by a cut-off battler with blood covered near a hook at the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject pigs from a pig farm in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports Wednesday, he traveled with his cousin of the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found a door to a neighbor's porch.
He said there was a big male pig in the corner with blood on his neck.
A forensic investigation confirmed, according to the report, that the 550-pound pig killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and squealing," said the cousin, who was called 'Wu', quoted the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera material showed how Yuan entered the market Thursday at 4.40 pm to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that the man killed does not belong to Yuan or his nephew.
A brand manager told the Evening New that the pig was closed to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan’s family and the trademarks negotiate claims compensation for his death.
Although odd, cases of pigs that have been reported earlier have been reported by people.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their site in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound-farm caught a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife frightened the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was fed by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "faster".
"They're not playful.
Their pickles, very curious... they're not about to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Rest of Orkaan Rosa is going to bring widespread heavy rains to the southwest U.S.
As predicted, weaker Orcaan Rosa as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring floodwaters across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had windows from 5 a.m. east time, 85 a.m., a Category 1 hurricane, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa Sunday is expected to move north.
Meanwhile, a struggle over the Pacific begins to form and to move east to the west of the United States. As Rosa Monday approaches Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will start driving heavy tropical humidity northwards the southwest US.
Rosa will bring rain from up to 10 inches [10 cm] in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in response to the approaching campaign, tropical moisture will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous cataracts, wastes, and possible land degradations in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause place-place rainfalls of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over the largest parts of Arizona.
Flocks are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions because of the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It would be very unwise to put the desert in jeopardy with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can cause deep - sanded rivers to fall and thunderstorms will bring heavy local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trunk will bring a little local heavy rain to parts of the coast of southern California.
Rainfall totals of more than half a inch are possible, which can cause low waste and smooth fish.
It will be the region’s first rain of the season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will cause Arizona to start getting closer to Sunday and early Monday before the rain makes Monday and Tuesday more widespread.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Angles on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the North Pole cools, but the troops remain very warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, growing summer temperatures will try to increase and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern U.S. October are expected to start warm, with widespread 80s from the Southern Lowlands to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a higher chance at average temperatures for the eastern U.S. for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks at the impressive testimony of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christian Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that had occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political point of death continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's on-the-spot conversion: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh would beat her in alcohol and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a hearty witness, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people who look in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's a hearing as big as one for a decisive football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose Opinionary Gasher Kavanaugh strongly supported the appointment, was all the networks ahead with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Concern was still high after the trial.
Flakes were the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was arrested on Friday morning at CNN and CBS where defendants yelled at him when he tried to take a elevator to a judicial committee.
He stood for a few minutes with his eyes down while CNN vividly pictured how he was slaughtered.
"I'm standing right here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
It was said to him, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flakes said that his office had issued a statement and had gone before the elevator door, saying he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and exhaust networks all covered live hours later when the Judicial Committee would vote to promote the appointment of Kavanaugh to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do it with the understanding that the FBI will look at the claims against the candidate for the next week, as the Democratic minority requested.
Flake is partly convinced by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republics would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has set up an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British EM May accuses critics of 'political games' about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May criticised her plans to leave the European Union, accused of "political gambling" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May day on 29 September 2018 for the Conservative We party conference in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview with her on the front page of the paper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued with his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should introduce each other's tariffs was "totally ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspected Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect in the fatal murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on a second-degree murder charge, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the riot.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, reports CBS-filed WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police told him that he had killed Wayde.
His bailout was set at $3500,000, the lawyer reported.
The judicial office of East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound at the neck.
The department commends the Louisiana State Police's continuing task force, the state police's crime lab, Southern University police and local citizens for their assistance with the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanks for law enforcement for his "zeal and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot predictor grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per race.
On Friday morning LSU basketball player Will Wade told the team to "beat" and "shock" about Wayde's death.
"That's what you worry about all the time," said Wayde.
Volcanic as on Mexico City
As springed from the Popocatepeti volcano, the southern vicinity of Mexico’s capital reached.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexican Saturday to stay away from the volcano after recording activity in the crater and recording gas and as early as 24 hours of 183 releases.
The center has multiple vibrations and explosions monitors.
Social media images showed how thin low - gas motor wind screens near Mexico City like Xochimilco were covered.
Geophysics marked an increase in activity at the volcano, which was 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police fights with Catalan separatist for commemoration of independence voice
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence investigators clashed with riot police, and thousands joined in protests to remember the first reminder of Catalonia's polarizing vote for resignation.
A group of masked proseparatists who were held back by riot police took eggs and threw powder paints that caused dark dust clouds in streets that usually wet from tourists.
A stowaway also broke out later in the day and the police had to use their knots to keep the brawl in.
For several hours, pro-independence groups on a show "Don't forget, don't forgive" sang in comparison with the unionist's cry of "Lank Live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries caused by the riots reported the local press.
The tension continues to run high in the independence community a year after the referendum of 1 October was considered illegal by Madrid but is celebrated by separatist Catholics.
Elections were overwhelmingly vocal in their independence, but the participation was low, with those who had largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police attempted violent clashes to prevent the voting at the polls across the region.
Pro-independence groups camped on Friday night to prevent a campaign in support of the national police.
The campaign continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist campaign with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful of the prospect that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we went through one of the best moments.
I've seen my parents cry out of joy because they could vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a life-long yet narrow victory in district elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain this year's momentum, with many of their most famous leaders either in self-recognition or in custody for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took up the campaign in support of the police on his phone, says the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It gets more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would be in European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to reject the decline in democratic values and the oppression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after engine against home row
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after a car repeatedly stuck against a house in Londonderry.
The incident spread on Thursday at about 19:30 BST in Ballynagardsingal.
Detective Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been shot at a stage to the car.
Menga goal gives Livingstone 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga’s first goal for Livingstone assures victory
Promotional Livigston surprised Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 matches as a driver of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga’s goal was evidence of the difference when Gary Holt’s team moved with Hibernian to second.
Gerard's team stayed in the Prime Minister's season without a road and came to stand before the predecessors of Heart, who are ahead of them eight points.
Rangers were first host to Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston expanded their unsurpassed track in the division to six matches, with Chief Holt who still hasn't tasted a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone plays odds against bone visitors
Holt's team had to run ahead long before they scored a goal, with their roundness that Rangers had brought all sorts of problems on their necks.
SR broke through, but turned before the target hatch, then AL could play wide only after he got closer and CH’s head met across the target hatch.
The guests were pleased to have Rangers play before them, knowing that they could get the visitors with dead toys.
And so the decisive objective came.
Rangers set off a freehead and Livingstone created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson, who together gave Menga the chance to jump and draw a target from the middle of the frame.
At that time, Rangers owned but could not force the home defense, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos had forced a coup from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was fired by the feet of Rangers-targeter Allan McGregor, and Lithgow was far-reaching to get rid of Livingston's still open game.
Overcrustions have repeatedly reached and reversed Livingstone’s frame, while two fines — after Halkett’s challenge by local replacement Glenn Middleton and one for handball — have been removed.
Livingston’s “Fenomenal” – Survey
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal games and outcomes for Livingstone.
Up until the last man was excellent; they still exceed expectations on this high course.
Their playstyle and team have been almost unchanged since their return to the first rank, but much honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was tremendous in his manipulative defense order, while Menga kept on toes for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
Rangers, however, were short of inspiration.
As good as they could at times under Gerard’s standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once could they push through the home team, which is somewhat of a group for Rangers, which they found in the middle division.
Erdogan receives mixed receipts in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th) there were smiling and blue air when leaders from Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had an outcome on issues involving human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police have quoted security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering before the mosque, but many supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of their Kurds – also made their voices thick and both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The warring objections reflect the disunity of a visitor greeted by some German Turks as a hero and found by others as an autocrat.
Deptford Road Accident: Cycling Dies in a Motor Combat
A bicycle driver died in a conflict in London where a car was involved.
The clash took place around 10:15 BST near the junction of Beswod Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present, but the man died on the scene.
The clash comes months after another rider died in a hit-and-step at Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said officials are working to identify the man and whitewash his neighbor’s belongings.
Road closures and bus routes were instead recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards injured in attack
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high-security man's prison, the prison said.
On Sunday, about 09:30 BST broke out and was still running at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tornadokeepers" was called upon to handle the attacker, which included eight prisoners and was limited to one wing.
The guards were treated on the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to pay attention to a continued incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and be able to stay behind the trails."
HMP Long Martin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
It was reported in June that the chief of the prison had received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials were called upon to pay attention to serious disorder during which staff with billiard balls were attacked.
Orkaan Rosa Dreig Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kitsflude (Drugs Trek Dalk Advant)
It's unusual that a tropical low pressure hit Arizona, but that's exactly what can happen early next week when Orkaan Rosa's remaining energy is moving over the southwest desert and bringing in kitty risks.
The National Warfare has already issued kites for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to south and east Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and to bring rain by Monday.
The National Heritage in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status since 1950 within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The National Orkaan Center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon border of Arizona.
Other parts of the Southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Come, are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of perhaps 4 inches.
For those outside the canal risk, Rosa’s rain will likely be a blessing, since the region is plagued by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, this rainfall will likely be beneficial, since the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Droogtemonitor, only over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Orkaan Rosa’s path leads to the approach of land around the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still on a sunny Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north to 12 miles per hour.
The storm strikes colder water in the Pacific Ocean, so its power goes down.
So it is expected that its Monday afternoon or evening will reach the country against tropical storms in Mexico.
Rain falls on parts of Mexico can be heavy and contain a significant flood risk.
"The total rainfall from 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to the northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then, as a tropical storm north over Mexico before Tuesday in the early morning, reach the Arizona border as a tropical depression and then move through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger expected of Rosa is a very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the US Southwest," said the National Orcaan Center.
These rains are expected to cause life - threatening creeks and torrents in the deserts and earthquakes in the mountainous areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured teenage son was found at around 04:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital where he's still in a stable state.
A 17-year-old, two- 18-year-old, and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials have appealed to anyone who may have any phone image material of what happened to come to light.
Trump says Kavanaugh's "sweet under the community, the anger" of the Democratic Party.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "has been lying amongst the community, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed Thursday before the Congress and emotionally denied a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified in the hearing about her claim.
The President said Saturday the Americans saw Kavanaugh's "brightness and courage" that day.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh, is a voice to confirm one of the most competent legal minds of our time, a judge with a clean record of public service," he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president referred directly to Kavanaugh’s nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican appearance at the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lifetime.
I don't stand, but actually I stand," he said.
That's why I fight for these candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and prevent."
The first important procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected not to take place later than Friday, a senior GOP leader said to CNN.
Hundreds of deaths due to Indonesian earthquake, tsunamis, with still rising numbers
At least 384 people were killed and many washed away when huge waves broke on beaches when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city of Palu on the beach for a feast on the beach when fires broke from up to six meters (18 feet) high at sunset on the beach, many washed away after their death and destroyed everything that was in the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-wide earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB said during an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, it dragged cars, steams, houses together, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said and added that the tsunami was moving across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed trees to free the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were displaced to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the disaster relief show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges torn and broken down and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still shaking.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's agency for the evaluation and application of technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's giant shield was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits at the tip of a long, narrow bay, could have worsened the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "great" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels collapsed.
Bodies of some victims were found where they were trapped under the ruins of broken buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the accidents and damage could be larger along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Dontgala that is close to the earthquake map.
Communication "is completely blocked with no information" from Donghala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticised for not reporting that a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said that the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur imaging material shared on social media, one can hear a man on the top floor of a building desperate warnings about the coming tsunami screaming to the people downstairs in the street.
Within minutes a wall of water hits the beach and sledge buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately declare the image material.
The shaking and tsunami caused major power cuts that cut down communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuations still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport was reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo would visit clearing centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia's death rates are up to 800.
It is very bad.
Although World Vision staff from Dongalla arrived safely in Palu City, where workers were hiding in shelters built in their office’s courtyard, they were on their way to scenes of destruction, said Mr. Doseba.
They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It is very bad.
Even as relief groups begin with the daunting task of launching the disaster relief kit, some people have complained that foreign relief workers are being prevented from traveling to Palu with much experience.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, stocks, and personnel from overseas can begin only after the disaster area has been declared nationally.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a disaster at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'Well, it's a national disaster,' we can open it to international assistance, but it doesn't have a status yet."
With the arrival of the second night at Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunamis, friends and family of those who are still missing hope that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad stories of natural disasters.
Saturday a little boy was taken out of a sewer pipe.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman for two days under a puine was stuck with her mother's corpse next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the director of the Indonesian national waveboard team, had taken off two of the missing waveboard fighters for the Asian Games that had ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Still others who were arrested at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"If a senior in the valley-screen field I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon tells how, in the hour after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circled on social media under the waveboard community, he was desperate to send whatsapp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were only answered with one gray mark, instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Steal $26,750 during refill of OTM by Newport on the Livee
The thief stole $26,750 on Friday morning at a Brink's worker who refilled an OTM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news statement from the Newport Police Station.
The car's driver was cleaning up an OTM in a entertainment complex and getting ready to deliver more money, tracker Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press statement.
While he was busy, another man came "from behind the Brink's worker" and stole the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses had seen several suspicions that ran away from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity must contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name — to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "The beings previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been the nickname Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change occurs before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to announce his new Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande with the program that canceled for "emotional reasons," said the program's producer.
In addition to the fact that it is abbreviation of his current professional name, West has in the past said that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when he discussed his album title with radio provider Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye — just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of known rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was known among others as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West co-worker, JAY-Z, has either ended up with or without a sign and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use force against civilians
Mexican newly elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, in turn, promised the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody revenge against students never to use military power against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never use the force to conquer the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot a peaceful demonstration in the square where up to 300 people were killed at a time when left - handed student movements were posted throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training leave youth to gangs.
U.S. has to double the KI funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. has to double the amount spent on research in this field, investors and KI practitioners Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the U.S. government have made KI notifications, even recently the U.S.A.'s overall formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, last year China announced their plan: to be the No. 1 in KI innovation by 2030.
"Double the KI research budget will be a good start, giving all the other countries so far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in KI," said Lee.
The duplication of funding may double the chances that the next major KI performance in the United States will be achieved, Lee said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Synovation Ventures, who has proposed in one of China's most prominent KIC companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on a KI system that hit the highest approved U.S. Othello player and later he was a manager at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions of the U.S. government, such as the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotic challenge and asked when the next one will be, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government seats, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders; it's the corporate law," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have appointed influential people from other universities to work at AI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help to support US KI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhDs in KI," he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council issued its next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a joint center for artificial intelligence aimed at involving partners from the business and the academic world and the White House announced the formation of a Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the NSF, it currently proposes more than $100 million per year in KI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been under fire for months.
Macedonians vote in preference or have to change country name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday whether to change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia", an action that would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece that blocked its membership boats for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that their northern neighbouring country's name represents a requirement in the area and has refused their permission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycotting campaign was doubtful whether the appearance would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum stamp read: "Is it in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it is a price that can be paid to seek permission for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough parliamentarians have said that they will accept the outcome of the vote to decide.
The name change will require a second-department in Parliament.
The State's election committee said there were no reports of inaccuracy by 1 nm.
However, the attendance was then only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an elector in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonia’s EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote for Macedonia’s referendum on changing the country’s name to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small increase and brought chairs to the tent by those who are going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the great majority will be in favour of it, for more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he gave his voice.
He said a "yes" rash would be "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum – less than the required amount.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said that they would vote.
For the referendum to be successful, attendance should be 50 percent plus one vote.
A return in the referendum will be the first serious return to the policy of a pro-Western government since the government took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero navigates throughout Brighton’s defense for a purpose
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling removed the Brighton defense in Manchester City’s 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously easy during his purpose in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goalkeeper received an ad at midfield at the beginning of the series.
He chased three Brighton defenders through before he hit the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He crossed at one more defender before he crossed several others on the edge of the Brighton target.
He then pushed a finger to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English predictor used his first touch in the hook to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to hit the Brighton-target Mathew Ryan with a spear to the right of the net.
"Aguero struggles with problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola said to the journalist.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are happy that at that moment he has set a goal."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premierliga fight.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area on that game.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had some touchings before he led Sterling to the worst target angle.
The Sky Blues’s predecessor rushed the ball into the net just before he was across the back.
City road Hoppenheim in Campioneliga Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. by Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play chess against Rockies
With the Nationals who are out of the game, there is not much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competent Scherzer wants to accept the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still play-implications for the Rockies, which has a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies got at least a promo selection place with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday evening, but still wants to get their first division title.
"Although we don't play for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any point of me this year in the face.
Why would I not want to take part in it?"
The Nationals still have to announce their initial player for Sunday, but according to the report, it is favorable to let Scherzer into such a situation.
Scherzer, who will begin his 34th, had a throw-off session Thursday and will play on his normal rest Sunday.
Washington's right-handed 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 extracts in 220 2/3 times this season.
Trump held conventions in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation around his Supreme Court choice Brett Kavanaugh while discussing the importance of Republican appearance at the mid - term elections.
"All we've done is on the game in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
It's one of the big, big – I'm not standing, but I'm actually standing and that's why I fight for these candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump went on, "A man sees this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, a man sees it happen now.
And now they are determined to take back the power by any means; one sees the community, the kindnesses.
They don't give up on him who hurts, on whom they have to walk, that they may get power and control. That is what they want, power and strength. We won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "stand back and prevent."
"And one sees it over the past four days," he said, and called the Democrats "a plague and a pity and a falsehood."
On the name he referred to Senate’s judicial committee’s high - ranking Diana Feinstein, who received hard orders from the audience.
"Remember her answer?
Did you delete the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, I'm waiting for one – it was really weak body language – the weakest body language I've ever seen."
Workers' party is no longer a large church.
It is unbearable to those who say what they think
When Momentum’s activists voted in my local party to put me under a censorship, it was not just a surprise.
After all, I'm the last person in a string of Laborersparty LPs to whom we're told we're not welcome – all because we said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she stood up to anti-Semitism in a fearsome way.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me because I was different from Jeremy Corbin.
About the importance of a responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, ironically enough similar issues that Jeremy was dealing with with previous leaders.
The announcement to the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting said Friday that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Labour Party LP, it was exactly what Friday’s AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, it is not today the show of many meetings and the promise of "friendlyer, more kind" politics has been long forgotten, if ever started.
It became increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Workers ’ Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party’s leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political views began to expect me to make a U-turn and take up positions that I would never otherwise have agreed with – whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public -- and it doesn't really matter what I say -- there's a triad of shelling on social media that asks me not to be re-elected, a rejection of politics from the core and to tell me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And that is not just my experience.
In fact, I am happier than my colleagues because the comments directed at me are political.
I have a lot of respect for professionalism and determination for those colleagues who every day face a flood of sexist or racist insults, but never fear away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this age of politics is how the levels of injury have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn last week claimed that the Workers Party must cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church, and with every "museum of mistrust" or change of selection rules, the party becomes more strict.
I had much advice in the past two years that encouraged me to stay under the radar, not to be so pronounced, and that I would then be "ukei."
But I did not participate in politics to do so.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolgirl, encouraged by thatcher government's neglect that literally left my state high school dropouts, I have been trying to fight for better public services for those who need it most – whether as a local council member or government minister.
I never hid my politics, including at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been at all confused about my political positions and areas where I differ from the present leadership.
To those who attended Friday's Mass, I can only say that with the country sending on a Brexit that will damage all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to seize time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Workers' Party.
But the only message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my voters, or they are now members of the Workers' Party: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats from being re-elected or political advantage will prevent me from doing what I believe is of the best interest of all of you.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: Unsurpassed Father Over
Two late threes may have pulled the final outcome slightly, but there is no doubt that Air earned to win this wonderful-usual Tentent's Prime Minister's Day-win.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard, the only uninhabited team in the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better odds, that carried the home team and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
"We have so far been tested in our games and we are still unsurpassed, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "Lord, they took their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, lost by Frazier Climo, made Air ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, who was made available for the Warriors' game, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot recorded an undisputed three.
Climo enlarged Ayr's origin with a penalty head, just before he, just before rest, had lost a solo trim to make it rest time 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose began the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s three, cut through Baggot, reduced the backbone to five points.
There was a long recollection for a serious injury at Ruarid Knott that was carried off on a portable, and from the beginning Ayr increased the progress with a Stafford McDowall-three, routed by Climo.
Air's watching captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and once again Melrose used the extra player with an unspoiled three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of very busy play.
The home team made a return and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he killed Climo without the ball, and MacPherson pushed the ball to death after the coming Air Soldier.
Climo managed it, as soon as he had done almost at the beginning, after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong got his target head and ran away Gregor Henry for the home team’s fifth three.
Still Game star seems to be approaching new careers in restaurant business

'The sea is ours': landscaped Bolivia hope court will reopen away to the Pacific Ocean
Matriculate patrolling a masculine shipyard in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sailboat.
Fleetbases from Titicaca More to the Amazon with plaice with the slogan: "The sea is right ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the country around Bolivia, the memories of the coastline they lost in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century to Chile are still fresh — just the need to reinvigorate the Pacific.
That hope is probably the highest that it has been in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a ruling by the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of consultations.
"Bolivia has the moment, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course expects the outcome with a positive attitude." said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the IGH statement on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favour of Bolivia's claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president – who next year faces a controversial fight for re-election in the face – also depended on Monday's ruling.
"We are near to return to the Pacific," he in late August promised.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court in Bolivia will decide in favor — and that if so, it will change little.
The Netherlands-based United Nations body has no authority to recognise Chilean territory, and has argued that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IHR's statement comes only six months after the last demonstration shows that the case "was not complicated," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia, the past four years may have slowed it down.
"The issue of access to the sea was purchased by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales ’ aggressive rhetoric baptized any remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at a time, but it will be extremely difficult to hold close talks.
The two countries sold out ambassadors last in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was extremely rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of differences with reciprocal benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America's most popular presidents – used the seafaring issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons won't come unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never first disarm their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He appealed to the United States to fulfill the promises made during a consultation in Singapore between the rival countries’ leaders.
His remarks follow to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is evidently on the verge of relaunching nuclear diplomacy, which reached a dead point, more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "dream image" that continued sanctions and U.S. arrest to a statement that ended the Korean War will also bring the North on his knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the statement without first taking significant steps to disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second consultation.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about avoiding an arsenal that considers the country the only way to ensure their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump consultation.
Parisian fashion shows reveal the latest series of big head coverings on the way to the shops near you
If you want to enlarge or completely reject the sun, you do not need to search further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne announced a series of very large head coverings at their SS19 collection in the course of the course that admired the style at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely unpractice guard passed through this summer Instagram, and these designers prepared their confused creations over the course of time.
The flashlighter by Valentino was a large beige hat with a square wide edge that hit the models' heads.
Other high attendances included wading gums decorated with jewels, a magic hat and even a pineapple – but it is not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also announced a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had elaborate lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than a tall couture.
One creature looked like a shuddering device, with a snorkel and a thick brilliance, while another looked like a melted room.
And if you continue the great fashion, it is your happy day.
Stylish viewers predict that the huge range may be on the way to the shops near you.
The vast range follows briefly on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot wide edge seen on all's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cultural label behind the extremely impractical hat spread over socialism has sent another great creation over the course -- a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the sweaty model that wore it.
The burnt orange raffiasak, finished with raffiafractions and finished a white leather handle on the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Modeweek.
Known style Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large ranges and beach bags in shops for the next summer – as the designer made such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the request for overcoming futures.'
John Edward: Language skills vital for world citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have a ritual performance of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with a number of excellent exams, only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community companies.
With more than 30,000 schools throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career, and their position as world citizens.
As a education sector that can design and implement a suitable school curriculum, we see that world languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak with him in your own language, he will go to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exams, we can see that languages above are the league tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages achieved a higher grade A.
The data, collected by SCIS 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French, and 63 of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young adults will no doubt need in the future.
Languages now have the same reputation as the STEM subjects (scientific, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent schools’ curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey by the United Nations Committee on Jobs and Skills found in 2014 that some of the reasons why employees are struggling to fill posts are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what course a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such lifelong skill.
To communicate directly with people from other countries, a multilingual person will automatically be placed above the competition.
According to a YouTube survey of over 4,000 adults in the United States in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is now so important to teach today’s children language.
To learn a number of languages, especially those of developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will teach what is considered essential for the United States when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose in independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to achieve success, regardless of what the future holds.
At this point, in a global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of great importance to the country's future, and therefore it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages really need to be seen as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scotland’s young people.
It needs to be done.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will debut Sunday for San Diego Lakers
The watch is almost over for adherents to see how LeBron James makes his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers Chief Luke Walton announced that James in Sunday's opening-up competition against the Denver Nuggets will play in San Diego.
But exactly how many minutes he is going to play, it still needs to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell argued that James would probably play a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six matches in the preseason program.
"I don't need pre-season battles at this point in my career," he said.
Trump's West Virginia conventionyd, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts this evening a flagship election assembly in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first of five scheduled collections in the following week, including stops at friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmatory voice now being held back for his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming election because the Republics are in danger of losing control of the Congress when it is voted in November.
How late is Trump's plot in West Virginia tonight and how does one look at it online?
Trump’s plot in Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 nm. ET this evening, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can look below through live streaming to Trump’s collection in West Virginia.
Trump will probably pay attention to this week's trial for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense about charges of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation voice held back for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main focus of this surplus is to help the Republics facing difficult elections in November.
So President Trump's campaign said that these five collections in the following week were aimed at "visiting volunteers and supporters while Republicans tried to protect and enlarge the majority they had in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Controlling the Congress is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy field season," a spokesman for the Trump field campaign, who refused to call his name, told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, scheduled for the Wesbanco arena in Wheeling, can supporters withdraw from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points, visited.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who's behind the voting pattern.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to give him a hop at the ballot," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryderbecker 2018: The U.S. team shows that they have the courage to keep the hope alive when they enter Sunday’s single game
After three unilateral sessions, the four - game teams of Saturday afternoon were probably just what this Ryderbek needed.
The swinging slinger of the moment is a completely different sport concept but one in which players believe wholeheartedly, and certainly in competitions like that.
Where, then, would they say that the moment is now?
"They've gone ahead with six points and now it's four, so we carry it as a little moment, I reckon," said Jordan Spieth when he ran off at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points ahead, and twelve more that are being played.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there is much to encourage them, not least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each recorded three points from four.
Spyth was mortally from the top to the clear ground and led by his example.
That score of the ceremony got tougher as he progressed his rounds and he dreamed of a critical set to win the game four completely equals while he and Thomas were after two rounds with two back.
She says what she won for them at the 15th, was greeted with a similar cry, the kind that tells a man that he believes the American team has another chance.
"You really just have to pull everything out and worry you about your own game," said Speeth.
That is all that those players now have.
18 pouchs to print their stamp.
The only players who have more points than Spielth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable story of the Ryderbecker.
Four out of four European couples, but the couple were married, and nothing can be done wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't keep one on track on Saturday afternoon, but they also kept one on Saturday morning on track as well as during the last nine Friday morning.
That loop, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this overwhelming crowd, confirms that they are the players that should be hit Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can spark a potential European victory when the sun falls over Le Golf National.
Choose either at the same time or at different puppies.
However, it is too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short matches with Sergio Garcia, the four - baller in the morning, when he played with Alex Noren.
One keeps track of the track number and two doubles on the front nine has put the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they could not even come.
Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-balls and four-player teams are so exciting to keep close watch because of the interaction between the couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way in which a strategy can be turned into a perspective.
So far, Europe has always played better than a team and on the last day has taken a significant lead, but this four-game session has also shown that the US team has the courage to fight, especially at home.
Europe runs 10-6 during the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after they came out of Saturday's four-ball and four-playing games.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a difficult Tiger Woods to take their count even at Le Golf National at four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who was trying to preserve the trophy that they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, won the series 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance in the four games and won two matches, but they did not allow them to shrink back.
Jim Fury’s team needed eight points from Sunday’s 12 solo games to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novelty to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, who are called "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second couple in the history of the Ryderbeker who recorded four points after their first four matches.
After they broke Woods and Patrick Reed into the four-balls, they played excellently together to win a father Woods and American newsman Bryson Dechambreau with an even convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two matches Saturday, sometimes showed flash of brilliantness but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rest during the morning's four-balls, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four-games to a 2&1 defeat for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koopa -- which is the first and third on the world ranking.
Europe, however, did not always get their sense on a pleasant day with a little wind south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won a great tournament three times, and Justin Thomas, on Saturday, set the mark for the Americans with two points.
They scored a hard 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later returned to Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3&4 in the four-games after they lost the first two puppies.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder-becker has a team recovered from a four-point stand when they enter the single game, even though Fury's team has to play just on the ground to keep the trophy because they already hold it.
After two days, however, they did not seem to have an attack on Sunday.
North Korea says they'll certainly not unarm one side without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations Saturday that continued sanctions would exacerbate their mistrust from the United States and that the country would certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho told the world’s annual General Assembly that in recent years North Korea had "significant goodwill measures", such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear test site and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't see any corresponding US response," he said.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will certainly not unarm ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to the elimination of nuclear weapons, which would reward North Korea if it took gradual steps, his words seemed meaningful because it did not reject unilateral removal of nuclear weapons unconditionally as Pjongang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first summit meeting between a US president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore when Kim undertook to work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised safeguards for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said that Pyongyang must first open its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted attempts to mitigate strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. forces on the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exerts more pressure by tightening the level of sanctions to achieve their goal in a forceful way, and even objecting to the 'explanation of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions make our mistrust worse."
Ri said nothing about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, on which the U.S. leader earlier this week drew attention to the United Nations.
Rather, the minister drew attention to three meetings during the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae in and added: "If the party in this issue about the destruction of nuclear weapons was South Korea and not the US, the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
The show of Ri's speech was nevertheless dramaticly different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's fire arrows would be directed to the US country mass after "Mr. Evil President" Trump for Kim called a "firepilman" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations has Trump, who threatened last year to "completely destroy North Korea," Kim greatly praised for his courage because he had taken steps to disarm, but he said that much work had to be done and that sanctions still had to be there until North Korea destroyed nuclear weapons.
Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, and said, "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years, or five months."
China and Russia feel that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
But, the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said Thursday to the UN Security Council: "The application of sanctions by the Security Council must continue diligently and uninterrupted until we realize the complete, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unilaterally stepped up sanctions against North Korea in an effort to raise funding for Pjongang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the outside of the UN General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him only hours later of putting "responsible demands."
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon to break down a missile base and also a nuclear complex if the United States "consistent measures".
He said Kim told him that the "consistent measures" he wanted to see are security safeguards that Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course over enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year allows all its pre-graduate students to get more sleep in an effort to study the growing macho culture by working against caffeine-driven 'full-night sessions'.
An academic found that students at the world’s top university are often inconceivable when it comes to the basic principles of how to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after he gave a talk about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
'At the end of that one girl approached me and said, 'Why are they telling me this first, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had told her how important it was to sleep--which surprised me,' he told The Telegraph.
The course, offered this year for the first time, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance as well as how it improves their general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said that the university decided to take the course after finding that students were seriously asleep during the week.
The hourly course includes a few interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students should click on coffee cupboards, gowns, practice shoes and books to tell about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by sleeplessness and the importance of a sleepover.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep-absorption risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer can be increased.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know it won't change the student's behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know--just as you have the right to know what its health effect is to choose to smoke cigarettes,' added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride to 'student all night' still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and ever increasing pressure on students meant that sleeping is a growing problem.
To make sure that you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's 'secret weapon' should be to avoid stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said--even to avoid putting on weight, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a hunger mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course after he walked one of his classes last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to exercise him for a campus course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students consider setting up an alarm for when they're going to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effect of 'blue light' that is emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circular rhythm and lead you to trouble touching the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Target of Menga wins Gerrard’s men
Rangers experienced another sarcasm when Dolly Menga’s target head Steven Gerrard’s uncomplicated team had a 1-0 drop.
The Ibrox team wanted to win first as visitors since February's 4-1 season at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only served Gerrard his second down in 18 competitions as a driver so that his team was eight points behind Hearts, which had passed loosely in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga took seven minutes before rest, and it didn't seem as if a Rangers team would play without much inspiration.
As Rangers now fall to the sixth position, Livingstone climbs to the third and is only behind Hibernian on purpose.
And there can be further difficulty for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a headache after an object was apparently thrown off the side.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed by Air after the end of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that last week took a point from Hearts and he would have been in his nopes in the way his well-trained team had smeared their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated whale possession, but Livingstone did more when they had the ball.
In fact, after just two minutes they had to record points when Menga’s first takeoff of Scott Pittman passed on to Allan McGregor’s goal, but the middle-field player opened up his big chance.
A deep freeze by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner Alan Lithgow could only misscatter at the last target.
Rangers took control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he had to get a sentence at the quarter-point when he and Steven Lawless fought, but the divorce judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get only two shots to the target during the first half, but the former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly was severely beaten by Lassana Coulibally's head and a soft targethead of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s opener at the 34th minute may have been against the direction of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it, even though it is only for their hard work.
Rangers again failed to handle a deep set of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and sent it to Menga for a simple roundup.
Gerard acted at the break when he rolled Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had a nearly immediate impact when the fly sent to Morelos but the impressive Kelly of his strip chased to the block.
However, Livingstone continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett, who had long balls after long balls.
Holt’s team could have increased their momentum in the last stages, but McGregor got up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could get out of the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton had another late request for a penaltyhead when he got in touch with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geigerteller
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" German: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and WE TELL OTHER ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geigerteller.
Since then, the Geigerteller has been a support pillar of science, and it has also become a support pillar in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What on earth is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to trace radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you set up these ovens, you can even hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Look, it's all over!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues.
New cancer strain can teach the immune system to 'see' wheel cells
New cancer strains can teach the immune system to "see" and die
Disposal teaches immune system to identify wheel cells as part of treatment
Method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory
They can then see a protein that's common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman who was treated with the ingredient, who learned the immune system to identify wheel cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them into the laboratory so that they can "see" and then inject the cells again into a protein that is prevented in many cancers and called HER2.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising ingredient."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, prof. Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to remove immune cells from patients and "learn them" how to attack cancer cells has worked to beat some kind of leukaemia.
Kanye West began a pro-Trump spouting after his performance on SNL, while he wore a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was shown in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after a thorough action in which he believed US President Donald Trump and said that he would make him preferred in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, which is called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great hat, he marched out against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I talk so often to a white man and theirs, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star laughed with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee on charges of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it has not been put out, the imagery of West’s dispute was loaded on social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock the West by placing it.
The West also complained that behind the height of his head, it was difficult for him to carry on what he had worn.
"They put me behind the high tide.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat.'
They have my commandments!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
The West went, "Do you want to see the low place?" and said that he would wear his "supermanman's coat, because it means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love."
His comment had at least two appearances at the hearing, and members of the SNL roll division seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there who said to the publication, "The whole studio had become dead."
West was introduced as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the space fighter Mac Miller died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised by the performance of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who argued: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for your defense against the SACHER."
But Ms. Karen Hunter said that West was just "who he is and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I believe accept an ideology and preach that endangers my society.
He's free.
We too," she added.
Before the show, the spacecrafter announced on Twitter that he changed his name and said that he was now "the beings that were known before Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
With a spaceclayer, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, soft music-like Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticises toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his swordsmanship role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
Kit talked to The Sunday Times Culture and said he thought 'something went wrong' and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married with his fellow from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he 'reasonably strong' felt about working on this issue.
'I personally feel pretty strong about it at the moment--where did we go wrong with masculinity?' he said.
'What did our men learn as they grew up with regard to the problem that we see now?'
Kit believes that television may be responsible for the growth in toxic masculineity because of its extreme male characteristics.
He went on, "What was born and what was taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that young boys feel they should have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think it really is one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
Because something apparently went wrong with our young men.'
in the interview he also admitted that he would not participate in any of the Game of Thrones' pursuits--and follow-up when the series next summer doesn't come to an end, because he says he's 'clear with battlefields and horses'.
From November onwards, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thought that the best thing that came from Game of Thrones was to meet his wife, Rose.
'I met my wife on this program, so that it gave me my future family, and my life from here,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy crowned fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple married on the ground floor of Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, its health officials.
Some 40,000 new cases have been reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, which represents a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have done HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials at a conference in the province of Yunnan said.
Year after year, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission by sex is a critical issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in 1997 in China, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to work on the matter.
Maxine Waters denies that a staffed GOP senators have cleared the data, condemning 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters issued a statement on Saturday that a member of her staff placed the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charges were driven by "ultra rights" experts and websites.
"Truths, lies, and other disgusting lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The detailed information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for the US Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared Thursday online, placed by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate panel's hearing on the allegations of sexual misconduct against the appointed High Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the sites is related to Waters' office and made known the information of a member of Waters' staff, reported the Hill.
"This unfounded claim is absolutely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff -- whose identity, personal information and security were put at risk because of this deceptive and false claim -- was not responsible at all for the appearance of this information.
This unfounded claim is absolutely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly exposed online criticism, including former Withuis press representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This indicates that she does not have the temper to be a member of the Congress.
When accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
He should not be challenging.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters ’ reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of his seeming to have been too angry during Thursday’s trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tries to light water in the election from the cushions, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it is true," he whispered.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these misleading claims.
"We'll make sure the nurses are put on the lookout," she went on, "and that they'll be legally responsible for everything they do that is destructive and dangerous to every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - blonde Rowan Atkinson spying
It's now traditional to look for Brexit symbol in any new film with a British cover and it seems to apply to this relive of Johnny English action comedy-franchie - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn further difficult.
Will the tongue-in-the-choice self-satisfied about the subject of how obvious power we are is the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the helpless Johnny English with his eyelids and rubber face his license to make everything up for the second time renewed--and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comical creation for non-English-speaking film audience.
He is, of course, the ridiculously secret agent who, despite his vicious claim to sophisticated elegance, a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr. Bean and a good shield from that old who contributed a single note to the Chariots or Fire-Tamility at the openness of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He was also originally based on the traveller and international man of puzzles, who left chaos behind him, who Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard ads.
There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest version of J.E.
I liked Johnny English who ran to a helicopter while he was dressed in a middle-aged stripper and the screw blades short against his helmet cap.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is shown, but the humor feels fairly pale and peculiarly exaggerated, especially when the "nursed" movie brands like 007 and Mission can now use comedy with confidence as a component.
The humor feels that it is fun to children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s adversity is not as original and focused as Atkinson’s silent film clips in the person of Bean.
The eternal thematic assumption is now that Britain is in serious difficulty.
A copper cracker infiltrated Britain's super secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, until the agent's distraught service -- a pitiful little roll for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a first minister who's a blasted and confused character, who's already experiencing a total collapse of political unwelcomeness: Emma Thomspson does her very best with this quay-Teresa May character but there's only a few in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since each active spy is in danger, she should call someone out of her retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English yourself, now in service as a teacher at some decent institution, but what from the record gives lessons about how to be a secret agent, there are some nice jokes here when English offers a School of Rock-type spying school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency order and is reunited with his former long-term companion Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an all-emphatic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is expected to be too low.
Thus the Batman and Robin are fully reserving everything in Her Majesty’s secret service and coming down to Olga Curylenko’s beautiful woman fatal Ophelia Bulletin.
Meanwhile, the prime minister came under the dangerous assumption of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the mysterious Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey from ridiculous escapades: imbecile as cellars they burn a French restaurant, cause their chaos when they smear on board Volta's luxury oil; and English lets pure anarchy break when he tries to use a head for virtual reality to get familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
For that last scene nothing is saved, but as cute and as exhausting as it may be, the whole affair is pretty much like child TV.
Quite moderate.
And like with the other Johnny English roll pictures, I couldn't stop thinking: can't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes his talent his right?
Work refuses to think of a plan for Britta to work for a four-day week but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party has to consider a drastic plan that will cause Britta to work a four-day week -- but for five days.
The party wants to claim that company-based savings caused by the artificial intelligence (KI) revolution should be transferred to workers by giving them their extra day off.
It will make workers enjoy a three-day week -- but they will still take the same payment home.
Sources say that at the party’s economic agenda and plans to put the country in favor of the workers, it will “pass. ”
To change after a four-day week, the Trades Union Congress signed as a way for workers to use the changing economy.
A Senior Workers' Party said to The Sunday Times: 'A policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that fits the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Workers' Party will not be the first to sign such an idea, with the Green Party who promised a four-day work week during its campaign for the general election in 2017.
The ambition, however, is currently not signed by the whole Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Workers' Party said: 'A Thursday is not some policy and is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to explore his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from 'unseen directors' and 'winners' to service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not recover their entire investment since a Labour Government can make 'abductions' on the basis of alleged infringement.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on company management and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 per cent of equity in private sector companies, which can receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 minutes" or the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh may change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court at least one week late and above the question whether the Bureau's findings can convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that Sunday was broadcast, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley for the Republican sense. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could do anything to change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, and that accusation came out, and said, 'Have you done this?
"He was determined, firm, firm, firm."
Graham’s voice, however, seems unchanging.
"I have formed my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it will require an accusation of dynamism," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett zealously denied it," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she calls could not confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new."
What is the World Burger Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will be host to the World Burger Festival, an annual music event that has a particularly impressive group of stars that acts and has an equally impressive goal; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Burger Festival is now in its seventh year, and during the festival, tens of thousands of people will stream to Central Park’s Great Law to enjoy not only actions by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of the occasion to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Burger Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international pre-accession group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free card for the occasion (unless you are willing to pay for a BBP card), concerters had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But just how successful was a 12 - year - old World Burger who remained in pursuit of his goal?
Is the idea to reward people with a free concert, a good way to convince people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clitivism" people who feel they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a twin?
Since 2011, Worldburger has said that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, supporting a multitude of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies that are equivalent to over $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion was already paid or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a US-based company of investors and implementers who are committed to "helping children reach their full potential", and promises to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after they have received more than 4,700 tweets from World Citizens.
"With the support of the U.K. government, donors, national governments and world citizens as well as you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," the Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions to bring the UK closer to improving nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with malnutrition.
In response to one of the general questions on his website that asks, "What makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?"
worldburger answered, "It will be a long and hard path--sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartment movements before us, we will be successful, because we have more power together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists who will be offered at this year’s New York event by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S.A. can use fleets for "blocks" to prevent the export of Russian energy - Minister of Home Affairs
"If necessary," Washington could leave him on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, the US Minister of Home Affairs, Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Sinke claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it works at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an obstacle to exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just as in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe," he claimed.
According to an official, there are ways and means for you to do so.
"The United States has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the seaways are open, and, if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy does not land on the market," he said.
Sinke addressed the participants of an opportunity offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profit that considered themselves the "vote of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to handling Russia and Iran and noted that it is practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, a little or more, to finance and replace fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "one-talent" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The rulings come as Trump's administration was on a mission to replace the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe with a hop in order to replace Russia, by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump administration's officers, including US President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump Berlin Moscow makes the "captives".
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2-pyplyn, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fiery opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers must be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Minister of Energy, Aleksandr Novak, said at a meeting with American Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. view triggered a reaction from Germany, confirming their commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (MDI) called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state is involved with our energy supply," Dieter Kemp, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said at a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider it seriously" to be president in 2020," Massachusetts Senator said
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "consider it seriously" to stand as president after the mid-term elections.
During a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts confirmed Warren that she would consider it to stand.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our fragmented government and it includes a woman in the highest sport," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider standing for the president."
Warren had her opinion on President Donald Trump's air during the village meeting and he said "take the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm up to my inner concern about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very vocal in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
On a two-day Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A survey released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own voters did not think she should stand in 2020.
Eight-and-five percent of "probably" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Centre/Boston Globe recording.
Two-and-thirty percent supported the idea of standing.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former governor Deval Patrick had to stand, with 38 percent supporting the idea that he had to stand up and 48 against it.
Other high profile democratic names that were discussed to be possible in 2020 include former fishing president Joe Biden and Vermont's Senator Bernie Sanders.
When he said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin named Track Palin's PTSV by Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he joined in September
He was arrested Monday night and charged with a domestic violence incident.
"What my own son is going through, which he has gone through since he came back, I have sympathy with other families that feel the consequences of PTSV and the injury with which our soldiers return," she told a audience at a convention for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room," and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a little differently, they come back hard, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and airstrikes and every other member of the army have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assaulting a woman, interfering with complaints of domestic violence and possession of a gun while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of new asylum policies
Eighteen states and District Columbia support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that asylum refuses victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district submitted a friend-of-the-court-law mission to Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker and challenge politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the claimant in the Grace v. Sessions trial, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal policy, was not made public.
She says to her mate "and her violent sons," she abused, but American officials refused her request for asylum on July 20.
She was held in Texas.
The state prosecutors who supported Grace, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of applicants for US asylum, described themselves as nations that face deep problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy in 2014 turned a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (Council of Immigration Appeals) that allowed immigrants without the necessary documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Columbia's Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday in a statement that the new policy "is ignoring the State, federal and international laws."
"Federal laws require all asylum applications to be determined on the specific facts and circumstances of the requirement, and such a lawyer violates that policy," said the friend-of-the-court court order.
Prosecutors further argued in the legal order that the policies that deny immigrants access damage the U.S. economy and say it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and will provide "necessary work."
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered in June immigrants to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing from domestic and gang violence.
"Asiel is available to those who leave their country of birth because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership to a specific social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his announcement of policy on 11 June.
Asiel was never meant to alleviate all problems — even not all serious problems — that people face every day throughout the world.
Hopeful rescue efforts in Palu while deathly doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is growing narrow.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while she comforted her corrosive baby boy at a clearing center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute brings an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce."
Citizens were seen returning to their ruined homes, searching for drunken possessions, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-wide shaking, were overwhelmed.
Of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu’s air hospital where patients are treated outside because of constant strong shocks.
Trane fills his eyes as he tells of the violent earthquake that shook the fifth floor of the hotel room that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was impressed at the wall's cleaning, I think," Harris told the Associated Press and added that he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accused China of 'absorbing' with 'propaganda advertising'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American newspaper that praised the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador for China Beijing accused the US press of using propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the China Daily's paid inception in the Des Moines Register – the state of Iowa's newspaper with most sales – after he accused China of joining the U.S. Congress elections on 6 November, a complaint that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. elections, noted what US officials told Reuters, a new phase in an increasing campaign by Washington is to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a escalating trade war that has led to their tariffs being likened to each other's imports.
China’s payrolls early in the trade war were aimed at beating performers in states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador for China and the former governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing wounded American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstadt wrote in an opinion poll in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "now exacerbates anger by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government seized America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, a person at the newspaper kiosk in the street here in Beijing will find very limited divergent voices and not see any true reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese people have given about China's worrying economic trajectory, that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers was afraid of the offer to publish his article," although he did not say what newspaper.
Republics foreign women's electors for inter-elections with Kavanaugh debake, warns analysts
While many top republics at the Supreme Court are named Brett Kavanaugh and defend him in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warned that they would see a reaction during the upcoming inter-elections, especially of women.
The emotions about this are so high, and most Republicans remember that they already indicate that they want to continue with the vote.
Those things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School for The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s prosecution for an FBI investigation on the nippery will be enough to track down tough voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday--they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, soldiers "November is on their way!" were shocked as they marched into the entrance gate of the Senate while the Republics who had chosen the Judicial Committee to continue with the appointment of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the newscast.
"People say it was already high; that's true.
But it may be higher, especially among the swan-female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don't often vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which sets out the details of her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court-denominated, analysts said a counter-reaction could follow if Republics continued with the confirmation.
"It became a nightmare for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's vote or the final vote or the Kavanaugh being put on the bench, it's also about how the Republics handled it and how they treated it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to choose Democrats, pointed out to the news channel.
But Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe in Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with slightly more to the latter’s side.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents are sure or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35 say they are sure or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh was probably or was definitely watching during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s commission, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, as well as at least one other complaint, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Legal Committee last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted her at 17 years of age while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court-genuminized his family members revealed to her while attending a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the world’s web site plans to start a new Internet to tell Google and Facebook the battle
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world’s web, has led an initial effort to interact with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology- legend project, Inrupt, is a company that developed on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people are allowed to access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee ridiculed the idea of Inrupt as "world domination."
"We must do it now," he said of the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "Personal Online Data Storage" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and on a browser.
What is unique to the personal online data storage is that it is entirely based on the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization by data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the personnel contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt web site.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about announcing an overall change anyway, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a location on a medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the internet when he founded the World Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as he leads Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still remain the founder and director of the World Web-Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm great optimistic about this next age of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: WW1 Victoriakruis-spiritual celebration
The only clergy of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a fighter during World War I was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lt.Kol vr. Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack at Bellenglies and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was killed by a sharp shooter and never knew that he had earned the highest British military honor.
A monument was discovered on Saturday by his two little boys at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "bright symbolic" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's crowned performance.
According to the London Gazette, lt.Kol. On September 29, 1918, he led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a lot of dense misas and under heavy fire from the fields and machines."
He later rushed to the fire line and led the "greatest resistance" line forward before he only stormed a field gun and blew out three of the department.
Lt.Kol Water was killed on October 4, 1918 by a German turtle – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions are "something I know I can never stand, but something that is humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a crown to the parades, led by the Brentwood Imperial Jeugorkes.
Michael Vann said he "felt like he could play a role in the parades" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by a crowd of people."
MMA supporters stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you are awake all night to watch the packed Bellator 206 just to be unable to watch the main event.
The program of San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main program that would be broadcast directly at night in the United States on Channel 5.
About 6 a.m., just when Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to tell each other the battle, viewers in the United States were left speechless when the roof changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake especially for the fight until early hours.
One supporter on Twitter described the transition to the child's picture as "one or other sick joke."
"It's a government regulation that the content was not suitable at 6 nm, so they had to switch to child programs," said Dave Schwartz, senior fish president of marketing and communication, when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the Pig," yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would work on their schedule to include future UK viewers.
"I think that when I think of the broadcast, I think we can probably do something," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we'll be unable to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when it switched, there were many text messages sent over and over and it wasn't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that it will not happen next time.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six — as we normally do — and we have tried to offer more to our adherents and just go over our time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'minor' about sexuality
Olympic divers Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior about his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't go to high school before he realized that "not everyone like me."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs offered by Lauren Laverne, he said he smiled at his feelings about gay rights to give others "hop".
He also said that to become a parent, he was less concerned about winning the Olympic Games.
The regular provider of the year’s long program, Kirsty Young, took off for a few months because of illness.
When he appeared as a rejection on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else when he grew up, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings are less than, and otherwise feel, the real things that have given me the power and energy to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist became a high profile LGBT fighter and used his appearance at this year's State-bound games in Australia to appeal in more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he smells his feelings because he is so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and to give other "hope".
The three-time world champion said to fall in love with a man – US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – "he caught up with him."
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than he is, but says the age difference has never been a question.
"When you go through so much at such a young age," he went to his first Olympic Games at 14 years of age and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and low points.
The couple became parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says she's "full perspective" changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything went about 'I must win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son died the same name as his father Robert, who died at age 40 in 2011 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says that his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked for or they had all the cards for London 2012 — because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not inconvenient," he said.
The following year, Daley won the 2012 Olympic Games.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed about my life for a long time--to dive before my homework at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection — Proud by Heather Small — who also played with him in the construction of the Olympic Games and still gave him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson does not drive and withdraw to Saturday’s Ryderbeck
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder win, but he will have to adjust his form to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record- 12th time in the two-year event, was taken to the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four ball games and quarters.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time Major-winner will divide his day by being a raisin leader and work on the train station at his game in hopes of correcting what trembles.
Even at the height of his career, he was never the right driver, and therefore the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National job where the long robbery always punishs the demanding pitfalls.
And as if the job on its own wasn't challenging enough, Mickelson Sunday came up in his ninth match against the exact British Ope champion Francesco Molinari, who had joined the new Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points behind, start the 12 single games well, Mikkelson’s competition can be absolutely vital.
Fury expressed his confidence in his husband, not that he could say much differently.
"He had his role he had today fully understood, gave me a kick on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be right tomorrow," Fury said.
"He has much confidence in himself.
He was in the Heldesa Hall, and he has contributed so much to these teams this week.
I probably didn’t think he would play two matches.
I put more forward, but that is how things worked out, and that is what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there on the job, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will exceed Sunday Nick Faldo’s record for the player who played most of the Ryderbek matches.
This may mark the end of a Ryderbeck race that has never really matched the heights of its individual performances.
Mickelson had 18 wings, 20 lowers, and seven halfs, although Fury said that his presence had contributed countless aspects to the team.
"He's strange, he's sarcastic, caught, likes to tear the fool, and he's a wonderful old man to have in the Spaniard," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed to joke with him, which was fun to see.
He offers so much more than just a game."
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows great progress can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advance before the last day’s single game in the Ryderbek can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Dean made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where the team led by Seven Ballesteros, had a five-point lead, but only nailed with 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
"A man continues to remind himself that we had a great advantage at Valderrama; we had a great advantage at Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won the nail tie," said Bjorn, on the photo, after watching how the 2018 Class won 5-3 and yesterday was 10-6 at Le Golf National.
Thus, history will show me and all on the team that it is not over.
You're going full soon tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It is not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it's to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
I say all the time, I focus on the 12 players that are in our team, but we are also well aware of who is on the other side – the best players in the world."
Rejoice about how his players were in danger on the hard golf course, Bjorn adds: "I will never go ahead with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different color.
Tomorrow it's the individual participation that comes in turn, and it's a horse of another color.
It's wonderful to be out there with a mate when things go well, but when you're there individually, you're tested for your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to deliver to players, getting the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your mate behind and he should get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his wife, Jim Furyk, would want his players to go better individually than they did as players, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who obtained three points from four.
Fury himself had been surrounded on both sides of that great last-day, where he was part of the wish team at Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser when Europe had accomplished the "wonder of Medina."
"I remember every hidden word of it," he said in answer when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 spoke up to his players on the way to that last day.
"We had 12 important games tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as seen by Brooklyn, as seen by Medina.
When that moment begins in one direction, it puts a lot of stress on that middle game.
So we set up our team and divided the men that we felt, you know, will bring us magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the attack, and he faced Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the upper half of the division.
"I have chosen this group carefully in this order, for I think it covers it to the end," said Bjorn about his single-player choices.
Germany's new warship reset
The German army’s newest frigate would have served in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be there until at least the following year, due to faulty systems and growing costs, reports local media.
The entry into service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the Time newspaper quoted by a military spokesman.
This vessel had to join the Navy in 2014, but the troubled postal delivery issues plagued this ambitious project’s fate.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen class with frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a powerful air- and anti-shipship missile as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods — it should be possible to develop the latest frigates for up to two years away from theresaws.
However, constant delays mean that the advanced warships — which will obviously enable Germany to design power overseas — will already be obsolete by the time they act in their service, The Time.
The disastrous F125-fregate was recorded last year when the German fleet officially refused to put the vessel in service and sent it back to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that the fleet has sent back a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media said that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" make the ship useless if it is developed in a field race.
Software defects are especially important since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the manpower on older Bremen class frigates.
It also revealed that the ship was severely overweight, reducing work performance and reducing the fleet’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" is probably twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the wrong hardware, the award label for the entire project – including the training of the crew – also raised a question.
It has evidently reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems that have plagued the new frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the power of Germany’s fleet is on the wane.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the fleet's "ships that can be deployed are underway."
The officer said that the issue had worsened over time, for old ships were out of service, but no replacement vehicles were provided.
He complained that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg's class could join the Navy.
National Trust Listens to Flying Mouse’s Secret Life
New research is carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual and soprano bat as well as the brown long - and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on the property at important locations to track museum activities throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also make mobile recordings using hand-guides.
Expert canals of all recordings will check the frequency of the bats and determine which species are doing.
A habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS hopes the results will reveal what areas of habitat for the bats are most important and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management such as pasture creation and how to best manage forests for bats and other associated species.
Vertigo populations in Scotland and throughout the United States have declined considerably during the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleep and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly paper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Flying mice are not really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-orientation technique to display gogs and obstacles to their flight size.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land around the country, is very serious about bats.
These include ten trained experts who perform routine recordings and sleep - care inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization even set up Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve at Thrave landscape in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Landowner David Thompson says the land is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Thrave we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there is so much about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to understand better what they need to bloom."
He stresses the need to search for bats before maintenance is done in properties because it is possible that unconscious destruction of a single shell can mean the death of 400 females and young children and that an entire local population can be eradicated.
Flying mice are protected and it is illegal to kill, control, or prevent or destroy their sleeping quarters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations go."
Ronaldo dismisses rape claims as prosecutors prepare for German journals
Cristiano Ronaldo turned rape charges against him as "false news" and said that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His prosecutors are ready to review German news magazine, Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
The Portuguese and Juventus predictor was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in 2009 at a Las Vegas hotel.
He reportedly paid her $375 000 to remain silent over the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In an Instagram live video in which he spoke to his 142 million followers, hours after the claims, Ronaldo, 33, closed the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the five-time Ballon d'Or-winner to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the whole thing.
I'm a happy man and everything's right," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's prosecutor is preparing to read Der Spiegel about the claim, which they called, according to Reuters, "an unacceptable report of suspicion in the field of privacy".
Prosecutor Christian Schertz said the player would claim compensation for "moral compensation for any amount corresponding to the seriousness of the damage, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her, according to documents submitted by Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo after the alleged incident fell on his knees and said he was "99 percent" a "good old" left in the trap by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had taken photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to a trial outside the court because she was "feared for revenge" and worried about being "obviously humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she wants to reverse the skill now because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was at the time of the alleged attack to join from Manchester United at Real Madrid and moved this summer, in a €100 million match to the Italian giant, Juve.
Brexit: UK will 'repent forever' if their motor manufacturers lose
The UK 'will regret it forever' if they lose their status as world leader in motor production to Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "a source of concern" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a non-conformity Brexit can cost posts.
Last year, the Burnaston plant - produced by Toyota’s Auris and Avenis - produced nearly 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK engine manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are afraid of leaving the EU without agreement and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, said that they would close their mini construction in Oxford for a month to Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what motor manufacturers say supply chain risks are in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line runs on a "net time" basis, with components coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be distortions on the border that the company says can lead to delays and deficiencies in parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to maintain more than a day's stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers Plan for future relations with the EU has been "calibrated precisely to avoid those controls at the border."
"We need an agreement, we want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow not only to enjoy the current success, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications of not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue with what a very successful set of supply chains were."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but warned that in the long term, added costs could reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost mail.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and the United Union co-rapporteur, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when this post disappears, it never comes back.
A government spokesman said, "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says Withuis
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with adjunct prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein can "be postponed for another week" while the fight over nominated for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continued, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Legal Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian election mix, links between Trump-helpers and Russia, and possible cross-judgment of law by the president.
Whether Trump is going to thank the adjunct prosecutor general or not, and thereby threatening Mueller’s independence, Washington’s gossip stories have been fueled for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying a recorder to engage in talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House, in the middle of reports that he was on his way to thank you.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not to thank" Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate-regbank's hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump postponed a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh and the full Senate vote further.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for it has not been fixed yet; it may be this week, I can see that it is postponed for another week with all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up."
Some journalists will differ with that statement: Sanders hasn't held a Withus personal information session since 10 September.
Gasher Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of information sessions is not because of a contradiction for TV journalists who are "effect-fighting", although she said, "I won't argue with the fact that they are effect-fighting."
She admitted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more V&A sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without adding proof: "We looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the president of the United States questions, then it is infinitely better than to talk to me.
We're trying to do it a lot, and you've seen it a lot in the last few weeks, and it's going to take the place of a personal information session when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press statements with visiting dignitaries.
Solo-performing is rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbounded and timeless appearance to journalists who were gathered there.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit-free
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to show the country's gratitude and express the wish that they will remain in Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months before the US withdrawing from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed themselves to covering costs of completed status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU continued on withdrawal, on the way to the expected decisions of these autumns.
But the UK government has also stepped up their preparations for a possible non-conformity scenario.
I know it's a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I want to repeat how much I value each employee’s contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from around the EU and beyond bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the health service and that benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we want you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after major injury
Tennessee State Tigers' line player Christian Abercrombie had an emergency operation after he suffered a major injury on Saturday 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee-span's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State’s chief chief, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury had occurred shortly before the breakup.
"He came to the edge and kind of just collapsed there," said Reed.
Drivers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen along the side before he was placed on a portable and was taken back for further evaluation.
An officer of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie is from the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details about the type/range of the injury" and Tennessee still tries to escape when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, was at Tennessee State in his first season after he moved from Illinois.
He killed Saturday five times before leaving the game, bringing his total season to 18 deaths.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp tax when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp tax when they buy property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory Plans
The move will neutralize the success of Corbin's attempt to draw young voters
The stamp tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to collect up to £120 million a year — to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp tax when they buy property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an effort to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and to target high-cost workers.
The stamp tax increase will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United States, with the extra money that the government’s plans will help to counter portlessness.
The overload — which is outside the current seal tax, including the higher levels set up two years ago on second houses and houses purchased to rent — may be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects that this move can bring up to £120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of new London buildings are purchased by non-VK citizens who boost prices and make it more difficult for first buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become "spook villages" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in seal tax to help more young people to own their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping their property prices high by digging up land, but not using it, and encouraged Ms. May to distance from quotas to affordable homes to repair Britain's "dwelling ramp".
Mr. Corbyn announced a striking series of planned improvements in housing, including rental management and an end to "no error-delaying".
He also wants to give advice more power to build new homes.
Ms. May said: "Last year I said I will dedicate my first ministry to restoring the British dream – that life must be better for every new generation.
And that means restoring our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
But it cannot be true that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the United States as it is for foreign - based companies to buy homes as it is for hard - working British residents.
For too many people the dream of house ownership has become a distant dream, and the humiliation of portlessness has become too great a reality."
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become the driver of Scotland at one point.
The Scottish, 42, enjoys the challenge of blowing up new life in the North-East, which is now in third place in Liga One, three points below the top.
He moved this summer to the stadium of Light after returning last season St. Mirren to the Scottish Prime Minister.
"I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I picked up the second team, but it was all," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sports Sound.
"But I often watched as a child with my father for Scotland at Hampden and it was something that drew me back.
However, the opportunity can only come if I'm successful with club management."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he felt no fear of imitating such established names at such a large club, after he had previously shown suggestions from Barnesley and Ipswich Town out of hand.
"At the moment will success be measured for me by ''can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it certainly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably just think of myself as a success if I can get the club back there."
Ross’s career in management is only three years, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts’ staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third league and converted St. Mirren from on the edge of relegation to winners of the Championship title in the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a true crossroad," he said as he thought back on how he took Alloa's smiles.
"I really believed the administration was the right place for me, even more than to play.
It sounds silly, because I've done enough, made a reasonable existence out of it, and lived reasonable altitudes.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to come through weekly.
I am still going through it with regard to stress and pressure from the work, but management is just right.
I always wanted to drive and now I do it, it feels the easiest I've been in my own skin all my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, found recording
The summer heat wave improved Britain’s hard - core income, but it put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking places and groups saw sales in July with 2.7% saw a rise – but receptions in restaurants were down by 4.8 percent, figures showed.
Peter Martin, of the business consulting firm CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Sunny sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that Julie followed a similar pattern than last month, June, when drinking places were up by 2.8 percent, besides that restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8 percent in restaurant trade in June only worsened in July.
Drink-led drinking places and creeks have done far better and increased more than what restaurants have fallen.
Food-driven drinking places also suffered in the sun, but not as bad as restaurant operators.
It looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Generally controlled herbs and drinking places increased sales by 6.6 percent for the month, with food was cut off by three percent."
Paul Newman, of the leisure and hospitality analyst RSM said: "These results continue the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
Again and the impact of large social or sports events remains the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-the-home-out market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 per cent per year will be particularly difficult above and besides constant cost pressures.
The long warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food-driven operators and only the time would show if the more moderate temperatures that we have experienced since August would bring the necessary relief."
Total growth in sales around drinking places and restaurants, including new ones that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowness of trade notices.

One of five children has secret social media accounts that they hide for their parents
One of five children – some as young as 11 – has secret social media accounts that they hide for their parents and teachers, revealing a recording
Recording of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "insta-blads"
The news raised fears that sexual content would be placed
Twenty percent of students say they have a "head" to show parents
One of five children — some as young as 11 — creates social media accounts that keep them secret for adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in "false Insta accounts" – a reference to the Instagram photo industry.
The news raised fears that sexual content would be placed.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "head check" to show parents, but they also have private accounts.
A mother who came down to her 13-year-old daughter's secret shop found a teenager who encouraged others to "violate her."
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistress' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them admitting that they have private accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said, "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be "vote for athletes" on Scottish Athletic Council
Elid Doyle was elected as a non-executive director of the governing body's general annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated job and field detail and President Ian Beattie described the step as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilith has great respect for the Scottish, the UK and the world's athletic community and we are certainly athletics in Scotland will benefit much from what she brings to the advice," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm eager to act as a voice for athletes me and hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has the 200 meters and 400 meters at 1996 games in Atlanta under his four gold Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC expert, could not run after he had a short - term ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago, I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
Doctors said that only time would teach me whether I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but it was fully restored, learning again how to walk and do practical exercises today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Boiling pads that compare mothers to cows share their opinions online
A drilling company has distributed opinions online with an ad comparing breast-feeding mothers to cows that are milked.
Celebrating the launch of what is called the "world's first silent portable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-choice music video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom that the pump gives to mothers who milk out.
Four right moms dance in a bowl full of straw and cows at the size of a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you haven't seen it, it's not eggs, it's my breasts."
The cow's section reads, "Spring it out, pump it out, I run the baby, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
But the advertisement published on the company’s Facebook page caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received a mixed response from viewers, with many who say it is playing the "graves" of the dairy industry.
"Very weak decision to use cows to advertise this product.
If we have to become pregnant and give births to be able to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.

Another observed: "Explainably traumas for mother and baby.
But yes, why isn't it used to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "The ad is so out of touch."
Others defended the ad, with a woman who admitted that the song was for her "screaming"
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have one if I still had a baby.
Milking out made me feel just like a cow.
The ad is a little bit of a time, but I accepted it for what it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another person noticed: "This is a nice ad directed at mothers who are milking out (often in their workshops or toilets) and feel like "cows."
It is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign was based on the insight that many women who are lactating say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump is still dead, however, has no strings or tubes and just discreetly in a food bridge that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they're milking.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother noted: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a large and outstanding announcement.
By drawing a parallel between milking women and dairy cows, we wanted to put the milking process and all its challenges into the collagen, while we're in a fun way that people can connect to the wonderful feeling of freedom that will bring the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump picked up the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the run for designer Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children move style to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply although monthly border bodies have remained relatively unchanged, partly because of error rhetoric and policies set up by the Trump administration that make it more difficult to place children at home.
Traditionally, most citizens were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country would be put at risk by moving forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential citizens and other adult members of their households should pass their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration officer, and the congressman, testified that the agency arrested thousands of people who applied to provide unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Almost 80 percent of the individuals who are citizens or family members of citizens are illegal here in the country and a large crowd of them are criminal aliens.
That is why we continue to persecute those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to process the children faster, officials set up new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month after detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to hide-and-seekers.
Many will appear through videoconferencing, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status at an immigration right.
Those who are considered unfit for relief will be quickly deported.
The longer the children stay in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to hiding workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say those concerns are raised at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child's difficulty is more easily overlooked because of the size.
They added that moving the children to the tent village without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say good - bye to friends may exacerbate the trauma that has already been very difficult.
Syria tells the US, French and Turkish 'occupational forces' to withdraw immediately
When he addressed the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism and will be "managed in conformity".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said to the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, with millions who have been displaced, is "amply past".
He said Damascus will continue "to carry on this holy war until we have cleansed all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States trained and advised about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly Kurdish powers as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were in order for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "unreasonable fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returnees," he said.
"They're policying something that just needs to be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebellion of Idlib, created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement rejected a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear sprites" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including soldiers from the Al-Qaeda-connected Nusra Front who would be "pulled out."
UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to establish a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said that the panel's work should be limited to the "recognition of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the election in 2020, unless, as many liberally likely hopes, a state of charge and scandals will soon end his presidency.
In what no doubt "the most dramatic finals of a presidency will ever be!"
To date, there are no signs of visual impairment.
Since 2014, peak clocks have doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million peak viewers, over 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is top cable-circuited with more than 3.5 million viewers on big news.
"It's a fire that people are attracted to, because it's not something we understand," says Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snaging Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'For he has made me laugh,' told me.
There are entertainment values in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on the TV, the stories coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families, and the health of the world economy.
To turn off is a luxury that can cost only the most privileged viewers.
And yet it goes further than being just an informed citizen when you're in the sixth hour to watch a panel of experts debate on Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 voltruist flight-bath," said The Washington Post, and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality program is that he carries you something every night," says Brent Montgomery, the head of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump program's changing role division and daily loops in the plot (such as finding a quarrel with N.F.L., Kim Young-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode, otherwise you stay behind.
When I reached this week for Mr. Fleiss, it was 80 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was inside looking at MSNBC while taking CNN.
He could not get away, was not on the way with Brett Kavanaugh to appear before the Senate’s Court of Justice and the future of the Supreme Court hanging on the scale.
"I remember when we did all that crazy program at the time and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it seems they were right now."

Extra cash flow to the most exciting medium-term selection race in the house
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th century saw an influx of money, thanks to a movement of convention districts that two officials have now run in a race around the same seat.
The recently changed suburban Pittsburgh district has Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – measured forces.
Lamb is against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district of Old Pennsylvania, which is heavily overwhelmed by the new 17th.
The maps were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January determined that the old districts were unlawfully grounded in favour of the Republics.
The race in the new 17th ended with a campaign funding competition between the major parties' financial legs, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well - known name in Pennsylvania after a nailed victory in a wide - eyed special election in March for Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District.
The seat was held by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats a tangible advantage.
U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador rather than supporting China, but then reversed
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partner expelled the Trump Organization's board of directors.
Officials of the state departments decided to call back the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on "the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, earlier this month in a statement.
However, fines were only considered against El Salvador who received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug management, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, including a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level convention and focused on security and economic progress to follow a similar convention last year that was considered a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the Congress to continue to bring an effective end to any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pence was now determined to speak to the Congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the serious convention for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new hard messages or distress from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal consultation on the condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst who was close to the administration and also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
Study history
The next thing that may happen can be the special discussion of Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible bypassing of the court, of which there is now very significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller's focus is probably also on whether Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia worked together in the country's attack on our elections.
If the Congress were to go into other hands, Mr. Trump would have to face responsibility in that body, just as he was preparing to go back to the electorate, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peer group.
It's a bunch of aces, and I don't want to let you know that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable -- and not those of his equinoxes in Europe.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how much the battle can be calculated.
In 1938 German officials were ready to execute a coup against Hitler, if the West only opposed him and supported the Czech-Slovakia at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the slaughter of the years that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the course of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
Americans now face several such turning points.
What would we do if Mr. Trump, Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, thanked the man who controlled the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein was in hot water since this newspaper reported that he proposed last year to take up the president in secret and speculated about whether he was qualified for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the new FBI investigation requested by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the election for a convention that will hold Mr. Trump responsible?
If we watch those tests, there's a long winter ahead of democracy.
But I don’t think we will fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi power who once lived in my ambassador's house.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to go on Saturday candles on that table that carries the washing machine.
With this as my coming, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimisms for Rapid Vienna battle
Rangers play Thursday hosts for Rapid Vienna with the knowledge that winning over the Austrians, after the impressive match-off in Spain against Villareal earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the European League.
A knee injury has prevented middle-field player Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2th shot against Villareal, but he believes Rangers can use this output as a escape spot for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villareal is a good team," said the 31st year.
"We went into the game with the conviction that we could get something and walked away with a point.
Maybe we could have won it at the end, but a comparison is probably a fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday is another great European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a hard fight, because they had a good outcome in their last match, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can get through and get a positive outcome.
Last year was certainly hard, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but now there's a well-being factor in place.
The group is good, and the men really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now pass through, last season behind us and be successful."
Women lose sleep over these nightmares
Despite the fact that surveyors have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk about it to their relatives.
About half of the individuals in the National Wide Study said they talk to their spouses about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said that they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, fish-president of National Life Insurance.
Here’s where it’s right to start.
Speak to your spouse and the children: You cannot prepare your family to care for your needs if you do not express your wishes long before the time is right.
Work with your advisor and your family to witness where and how to get care, since those choices can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Enter your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come forward with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your funding decisions for long-term care can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own capabilities – as long as you have the money.
Execute your legal documents: Cut the legal battles at the passport.
Get a health care agent instead so you show a trusted individual to take care of your medical care and make sure that experts meet your wishes if you can't communicate.
Consider, too, your finances.
You should choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid if you are not competent.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Draw those details in a written plan so that you can be ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that are involved, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What is the medicine?
Who will care for the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Shooted several times in Ilfracombe with windmills
A man was shot several times with a windblade when he walked home after a night.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred at around 02:30 BST as a "possible action".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries were not life - threatening, and the police asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city Palu Friday, officials said, and the mortality rate is expected to rise.
With communication out of action, relief officials could not get any information from Donghala Regent, an area north of Palu that is close to the centre of the 7.5-wide barrier.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to safety after the disaster.
Here are some key events about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the point of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with a estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit them.
Dongala is a regent that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regent, an administrative area under a province, had a estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the support pillars of the Central-Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal area of Donghala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times over the past 100 years by tsunamis, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also struck West Dongala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the Seismic Pacific Ocean’s Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis of the last few years:
2004: A major earthquake along the west coast of the Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December, leading to a tsunami that hit 14 countries, led to 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong shootings hit the western coast of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6,8-range hit the south of Java, Indonesia was the most populous island, leading to a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-wide earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of the West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-wide earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, leading to a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozen villages and led to about 300 deaths.
2016: A level of shaking hit the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly shaking and tsunami in 2004.
It didn't lead this time to a tsunami, but more than 100 were killed because of a building that fell.
2018: Great explosions hit Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily beached.
Sarah Palin’s eldest son is arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and fishing presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report issued by Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he dropped a female knowledge phone with her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is held at Mat-Su Pre-trial Facility and is held on a $500 unsecured trust, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, certainly" when asked what he argued, the network reported.
Palin looks at three classes of A violations in the face, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offense, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal complaints against Palin have been filed.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The matter is now before Alaska’s Veterinary Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and owned a firearm while he was drunk, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed to have boxed her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by vet groups after she linked her son’s behavior to PTSD as a result of her duty in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-wide earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been set off with death rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors are looking for rare death sentences for suspects in NYC earthquake attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspicion in the New York City earthquake that caused eight people's deaths -- a rare sentence that has not been committed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot rental engine to launch an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side highway in Laer Manhattan to harvest pedestrians and a biker in his path in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "consciously" killed the eight victims and "consciously" suffered serious physical injuries, according to the notice of intent to ask for the death penalty, submitted to the Southern District of New York.
Both of those charges bring possible death sentences, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal big jury struck Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder for the benefit of repression, typically used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and a complaint of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "deep planning and preconceived", said prosecutors, and described the way in which Saipov performed it as "violent, cruel and perverse".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has injury, damage and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," stated the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the South District of New York was prosecuted for a death sentence.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug addicts, but eventually in September 2009 he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York, in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being sentenced to a conspiracy to commit espionage to the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were arrested with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Ziphov, a native of Uzbekistan, didn't repent in the days and months after the attack, according to the law of the court.
He mentioned to investigators that he felt good about what he had done, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded innocently on the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro deo lawyers representing Saipov, said that they were "naturally disappointed" with the decision of the persecution.
"We think that the decision to desire the death penalty rather than to accept a conviction to life imprisonment with no possible release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved." Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked persecutors not to desire the death penalty.
Tory LP says NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in control of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage made a vow to mobilize "the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory Conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to feel the "hot" of Eurosceptic – as one of Theresa May's own LPs suggested he should be in control of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative background banker Peter Bone told March in Birmingham that by the time the UK was "sudden out" if Mr. Farage Brexit was secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faces to unite her deep-separated officers by calling pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime challenge is to maintain its Chequers compromise plan in the middle of attacks by Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
The allies insisted that she would press through her attempt to agree with Brussels in spite of the death march – and Eurosceptic and Labour forced her to choose between package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone said to the Loop Mark Loop convention in Solihull that he wanted to throw out the "Checkers".
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been made an noble man and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he were in control, we would have been out by the time,' he said.
The Wellingborough-LP added, 'I'll get up for Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.'
He set out his opposition against the EU and said: "We did not fight world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bone suggested that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to be happy is completely false.’
Tory Brexiter Andrea Jenkyns was also in March and told reporters: ‘ I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who actually bomb the streets and make sure that we are selected in the first place.
Please let Chequers go and start listening.'
In a direct message to Mrs. May, she added: ‘First ministers must keep their jobs when they keep their promises.’
Mr. Coloure told us that the convention politicians had to feel the "hot" if they were on the threshold to break the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'It's about a confidence between us--the people--and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we won't let you get away with it.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
‘We mobilize the people’s resistance to this country that has given us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-governmentful, proud United Kingdom.’
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two - hour assembly in the city center.
A few activists turned Tories against Brexit banners to announce the group this weekend.
Worker Lord Adonis ridiculed the conservatives for the security issues they endured with a party application like the conference opened.
'It's the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus in place, for the uninterrupted border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,' he added.
'It's a whole fight.
There is not such a thing as a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren plans to ‘ look after’ to stand for the president
U.S. Sen Elizabeth Warren says she will "look hard to stand for the president" at the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts democracy spoke about its future at a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, stands for re-election in November against GOP, Rep Geoff Diehl, co-chaired by Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She is already in the midst of speculation that her Trump may be challenging in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Hollywood was her 36th meeting with constituents using the city hall format since Trump was under control.
A companion asked her if she was planning to stand for the president.
Warren replied that it was time "for women to go to Washington to correct our broken government, and it closes up in a woman."
Arrested in the shooting of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA., announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting incident Friday and asked for help in identifying a man seen in the image material.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University.
"Wayde Sims had a gunshot wound in his head and was finally killed as a result of it," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media through 247 sports Saturday.
Wayde came in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene, owned a gun, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 promenades last season and held an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumpballs per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton blinks world title after team commands gave him his victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified for the Saturday before Lewis Hamilton when Mercedes' team commands would play a major role in the events.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and won almost for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first entered the wells, and Hamilton left to ride far behind in the van in the traffic, something that had to be decisive.
The Mercedes went a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went on to wheel-on-wheel action that the Ferrari driver, counter-risk-free of the inner view, left at risk of suspension to a double-motion to defend on the third corner.
Max Steppen started off the back row from the roadside list and was seventh toward the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led to a large part of the events as he held on to his bands to quickly finish and cross Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He may have entered the wells on the 44th rounds, but he could not speed up his pace in the remaining eight rounds, since Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valteri had done fantastically many weekends and was a real gentleman.
The team did outstanding work to have one-two," Hamilton said.
It was a real bad lifting language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein at a convention for her insistence that she did not deliver Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused the Supreme Court of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a convention in West Virginia and did not directly address the testimony Ford gave before the Senate Committee. Instead, he commented that what was said in the Senate indicated that people were "common and unscrupulous and liars".
"The one thing that may happen and the nice thing that has been going on in the Senate over the past few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and common and lying," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
What do you mean?
Diane Feinstein, did you hurt?
Remember her answer... you licked the document--oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lick it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we lick it--No, we didn't lick it," he added, in a preface of the senator.
Feinstein was sent back the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was earlier in September — but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations. I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president did not respect her denial and made a comment during the Saturday evening convention: "I tell you what.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst lift I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court-recognised accused by three women of sexual misconduct and suggested that the Democrats use the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back any necessary means.
You see the community, the insanity, they don't give up on who they hurt, who they have to worry about getting power and control," the president said the media reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer threw two targets for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars reconciled Friday’s Elite League’s loss against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 match in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-way lead by throwing off Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team together before Dwyer restored the Giants ’ leadership.
Francois Bouchard brought Dundee up before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals determined their victory.
It was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keefe’s men who first lost the game and when Friday night won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
This was the fourth convention of the season between the shores, with the Giants who won the previous three matches.
Dwyer's opening ball came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull-help, with David Rutherford who had the help when Beauvilleer doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back to play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the supplier for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer surely made the Giants take the lead in the first break when he threw his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard got them back on track with a force target at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran agreed to help Nielsen to let Dundee lead for the first time in the game in the second half and made sure of winning with his team’s fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants who have now lost four of their last five matches are home to Milton Keynes in their next match Friday.
Air traffic controller dying to secure hundreds of aircraft can escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is regarded as a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people rose safely.
More than 800 people are dead and more are missing after a great earthquake on Friday hit the island of Sulawesi, causing a tsunami.
There are still strong shells in the area, and many have been trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues who had fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agg refused to leave his post in the control tower that swung heavily on the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained unmoved to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the run, was able to rise safely.
He then jumped off the traffic control when he felt it timling together.
He later died in the hospital.
Speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, says that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts break to hear of this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll can reach the thousands with the country’s disaster relief agency, which says that access to the villages of Dongala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the mortality rate is still increasing as many bodies are still under construction while many cannot be reached," said agent spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves that reached six feet [6 m] high, Palu rushed to keep a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News, "Every minute, I bring in an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimarks are plowed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Rooic Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Rooic Cross is hunting to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the country's military service: "I ask you to work day and night to complete every task related to disarmament.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Micronesian aircraft accident: Air Niugini says one man is now missing after a beach plane accident
The airline that handled a flight that crashed into a Pacific beach in Micronesia now says that one man was missing after they had previously said that all 47 passengers and crew safely cleared the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not account for a male passenger.
The air force said that they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The air carrier did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while it tried to land at the Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in a stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both said that the plane landed near the runway in the beach.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane had come very low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to walk through the middle of the water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the air conditioner had panicked and screamed and that he had suffered a small head injury.
The U.S. fleet said that creatures who worked close to improving a key also helped with a lifeboat to get people to land before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in ruins of PNG-registered aircraft in the last two decades, but Air Niugini has been involved in one.
Analyst sets out the time line of the night that woman was burned alive
The state closed its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man charged with burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice-analysis Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence-analysis.
He told the jury how he used phone records to gather the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night he died.
Rowlett said that he received location data from different phones that showed that Tellis and Chambers were together the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said, "Look, because my truck was in Nashville."
Just an inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when he was dead.
Phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a little after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers' messages, calls and contact information were deleted from his phone.
"He had removed her from his life," said Hale.
The defense was scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative look of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop moved away from its origin of political messages and the handling of social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common saw a recent revolution in the UK by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Just a black person?!
NEW Child's wife is a couple because she's thinking of "racist" text.
A New York child nurse reported a couple for discrimination after receiving a wrong address message from the mother who complained that she was "a pretty black person."
The couple deny that they're racist and compare the matter to "dispression."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was upset when she learned that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NEEAEEEE NON A black person," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to me twice.
After she found her mistake, a "uneasy" Plasco-Flaxman thanked me Maurice and said that their outgoing infant wife who was African-American did bad work and that she had instead expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent with a Uber home.
Now Maurice's journalizes the party for damages on the deduction and seeks his compensation to the amount of $350 per day for the six months, resident work for which she was originally appointed, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do such well," she told the post and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple returned to the claims that they were racists and said that it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice’s submission and feared that they could not trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a race.
We are not racist people," said the man Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were unscrupulous, even though it was by far?
Your ex-husband?
Let's go."
Plasco compared the matter to "pression" and said that his wife would have had a baby in two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going after such a person?
It's not a very nice thing to do," the investment banker added.
As the case continues, the court of public opinion was quick to bring the couple on social media and cut them off for their behavior and logic.
A new letter revealed that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear would not involve readers.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book, said about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun to know about Paddington's great success."
She said her father would have been hot if his work had been rejected. He was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book on the little toys. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release after his death was "bitter-sweet."
About Paddington, whom she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he wasn't an orange-looking man," she said.
"But because Paddington was really for him, it was almost as if one had a child who had reached something: you are proud of them, even though it is not your job.
I think he saw Paddington’s success in that way.
Though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the honour to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say hello to the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was chased to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad has regularly called to say that it was wrong, that they did not expect her to do it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I received the call from Nad to say that within the next two minutes she would die and that I had to greet her.
And I have.
I said, "Tashi, I'm very fond of you, heartlam.
I will soon be with you.
I will be with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating was slowly touching up and leaving her system.
She was a while before she died, and the body was closing.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it's like spreading.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep it together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who had been hurt at the time for the loss of her daughter, accompanied the other passengers aboard the plane - unaware of the test she had gone worth it.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head pierced and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on flight I got an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women post cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey's mail cards have been on a Welsh bridge for a while with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Me Davis’s son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself on the 18th.
"I want no parent to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45, lived in Lydney, and said that her son was a promising leader with a striking smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They've always said that his smile lit up any room."
But he gave up work before he was dead, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11, found his brother after he took his own life.
Davis said, "I am constantly worried that there will be a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there to whom you can go and to whom you can talk, even though it's a friend.
Don't sit still - you need to talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old husband, not long after his mother's death.
"He did not say that he felt sick or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the lowest point on Christmas -- when the children opened their gifts, he did not contact eye contact or do anything with them."
She said her death was very traumatic to them, but that they had to work through it: "This time a hole through the family.
This breaks us up.
But we must all go and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh’s future has yet to be investigated by the FBI
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked--a timeless investigation that had no crack--we could perhaps bring a little unity," said Mr. Flake Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee was "falling apart" under the narrowest partisan assembly.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to set up the FBI investigation?
Their opposition is all due to timing.
The elections are only weeks away, on November 6, if, as it is expected, the Republics go badly, they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to find the man they want to go to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House, and whom he met with his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI issues its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republics and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can come to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor which will allow Mike Pence, the President of the fish, to break a record and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea running numbers 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean warriors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-one seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-sought quoted data from the South's unique cabinet and said that last year there were 1,127 surges - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said more stringent border control between North Korea and China and higher rates requested by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang gave no public comment.
The vast majority of runners from the North are finally offered South Korea citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flights through Shina, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreans.
Shina considers the fugitives as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, often repatriating them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South — who still speak techniques in war with each other — have greatly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks that centered around the stagnant negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons.
It came to the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to work together for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho has been blaspheming for the lack of progress since Saturday.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally unarm ourselves first," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the UN General Meeting in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histories," says he is incapable of serving at the Supreme Court
Home Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "histories" and said that he was temporarily incapable of serving at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi delivered the comment in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had ever acted like this, they would say 'histories'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate judicial committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied charges that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times he screamed and sneered while discussing his family and his high school for years.
He also explicitly rejected Democrats on the committee and called the claims against him a "sudden and coordinated character loop murder", organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court because it showed that he was prejudiced against Democrats.
"I think he makes himself unqualified with those statements and the way he followed the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi was appalled when she was asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats win the majority in the Laerhaus.
"I'll say it -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not competent to be at the Supreme Court, but to be at the court where he is now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Ommangang Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a Democrat about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Law on affordable care or Roe v. Wade as he was considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would reverse certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'It's not wonderful,' said Pelosi.
And women must handle it.
It is a righteous diatribe, months, and years' rage that boils, and she cannot find it without weeping.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She went on, "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive officer, whoever said that she cried when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started to cry, she would tell the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Trans are allowed as a partial output for tomatoes because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early work in a man-dominated office is where I once found that I cried with nameless anger and was caught by my neck by an older woman--a cold driver for whom I was a little afraid--who dragged me into a reportal.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think that you are sad and will rejoice, because they have affected you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was in an out-of-court relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the recessions, I was very frustrated by Schroeder, realizing that there was no reason she could not investigate the idea that she could run for the president.
"I didn't think well of the decision," she said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves".
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with founders and so she made a vow that she wouldn't enter the recession unless she had collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who had given men $1,000 would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting fired?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not lead a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions--thank you for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and to target voters rather than delegates, and angry for the sexism--that she laughed.
You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder called me about how the press responded to her.
"You would have thought that Kleinex was my corporate guarantee.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put on my gravestone?
"She cried?"
How the U.S. trade war may be good for Beijing
The opening alvos of the trade war between the US and China were overwhelming, and while the battle is over, a disagreement between the countries may be beneficial in the long term for Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, first warned earlier this year by charging important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week, the most interesting scale has been to blame for new tariffs that affect $200 billion (£150 billion) of items and effectively charge half of the goods coming into the United States of China.
Beijing took reprisals every time and recently charged the prices from five to ten percent on $60 billion of American goods.
Shina promised to equal the US shoot-by-shoot and the world's largest economy is not going to move soon.
To get Washington to stand back means to surrender to requests, but to meet in public the US's requests will be too much of a disgrace to Xi Jinping, China's President.
Experts still say that if Beijing is playing its cards right, pressure on US trade war over the long-term China can positively support by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that can start an economic toll in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than viewers have known before," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia in the middle of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and calls for help to rebuild the land that has been devastated by war for more than seven years.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country improve.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that had made their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian people have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the plainland.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that protected the attack.
Europe Marks Ryder Recycling in Paris
Span Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and Span U.S.A. with a final point from 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Rider Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team picked up the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
US-star Phil Mickelson, who had failed most of the tournament, had his T-port in the water ply at the par-3 16th gate and gave his match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has been blind in all its rounds and has become one of the 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out by the player with the lowest rank on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The player with the world’s highest rank, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to land Poulter of England who might have played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder beakers, Spanjaard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament’s European winner of all times with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a tough year.
So grateful for Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I am so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory
He hands over the fable to his countrymate John Ram who won a few games on Sunday US-collapse Tiger Woods 2+1.
The incredible pride I feel, to conquer Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at dai old," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods has lost four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 racetrack Ryder Cup record.
A strange statistics by one of the biggest players of all time and he won 14 major titles second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team U.S.A. has been struggling to find the cleaning field with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau who played high-calibre golf all over the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance on behalf of his team: "I am proud of these servants. They fought.
There was a time this morning when we were putting a little heat on Europe.
We're done.
Hatred for Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 servants, and I am proud to serve as their captain.
You have to keep your hat tight.
We are superior."
News about Rooigety: Concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manatee, and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Natural Life Commission shows a general decrease in Rooigety concentrations for parts of the Tampa Baai area.
According to the FWC, clumsy blood conditions are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier cities — suggesting reduced concentrations.
In full flower, the Rooigety stretches about 130 miles [30 km] along the coast from northern Pinellas to southern Lee cities.
