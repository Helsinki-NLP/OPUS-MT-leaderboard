The members of the Wales Assembly are concerned that “they seem like plants ”
Some members of the Assembly were surprised by the proposal to change their name to MWP (sometimes Members of the Wells Parliament).
This concerns the intention to replace the Assembly's name with the Wells Parliament.
The members of the Assembly were concerned that this could cause fun at the political level.
One member of the Labour Assembly said that his group was concerned that it was "intimated with "Twp" and "Pwp".
Not for Welsh readers: "twp" means "fool", and "pwp" means "what".
A member of the Plaid Assembly said that the whole group was "unsatisfied" and offered alternatives.
Wellso's conservative claimed that his group was "open" because of the change of name, but noted that it was a reduction in the word from MWP to "green".
In fact, the letter of the vowels is considered similar to the letter of the Yorkshire English.
The committee of the Assembly, which is currently preparing draft legislation for the replacement of the name, said: "The final decision on all the names of the members of the Assembly will, of course, be the matter of the members themselves."
In 2017, the Law of the Wales Government granted the right of the Wales Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of the public consultation on the proposals calling for strong support for the Assembly to be appointed by the Wales Parliament.
As regards the name of the members of the Assembly, the Commission gave priority to members of the Wales Parliament or WMP, but during public consultations MWP called for the greatest support.
Members of the Assembly are clearly offering alternative opportunities, but efforts to reach an agreement can become the head of the President, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislative amendments within a few weeks.
The legislation on the scope of reforms and other amendments to the work of the Assembly, including the rules on the plan for the disqualification of a member of the Assembly and the Committee's system.
During the debate on legislation, the Assembly members will have a decisive vote on what they should be called.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the change of country name
On Sunday, the voters will vote on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
A general vote was held to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its province, Macedonia.
According to Athens, long ago, the name of its northern neighbour meant claims to the territory of Greece and repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s efforts to join the EU and NATO.
In opposition to the plebiscite for the change of name, Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanova said the vote would be rejected.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change of name is simply a price that simply needs to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's and other churches have suffered from Harlem's difficulties.
"The old people I spoke to said that historically on each corner there was a bar and church," Adams said.
– Today you can't find either one or the other."
He said, of course, why the bars disappeared.
“Today people interact differently,” he said.
– Just no more neighborhood sites, where people gather all the time."
Speaking of the churches, he is concerned that the money that he sells will not last as long as the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will return to where he began.”
He added that the churches could be replaced by multibytes with cooperative apartments where people who would not help the remaining saints would live.
"Most people who buy cooperative apartments in these multiples will be white," he said, "and will therefore speed up the moment when the church is completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of these people who moved to these cooperative apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built in 1870 by the white congregations, before Harlem became a black metropolis in the metropolis community, and St. Martin’s church was built ten years later.
The first white Methodist Congregation was raised in the 20th century.
A black congregation in the nearby town of Pamela accepted the name of the building.
The church of St. Martin took over the Black Congregation with the priest John Howard Johnson, who led the minority boycott on 125th Street, in the main store in Harlem, where he was refused to hire or assign to higher positions of blacks.
The building was destroyed by fire in 1939, but since the parishioners of the spiritual father Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a chariot.
Dictionary David Johnson, the son of the spiritual father Johnson, and heir to St. Martin’s church, honored the emperor by calling him a beggar.
The experts who won the crown in July called it "a cultural lobby" and "an unchangeable historical instrument".
At the University of Michigan, Tiffany Ng also mentioned that it was the first chariot in the world to be played by the black musician Dionysius A. Linds. 18 years ago he began playing a larger chariot in the Church of Riversaid.
Merriweather said that St. Martin's church did not change his other musician.
What has happened in the last few months in St. Martin's church was a complex history involving architects and contractors, some of which have been invited to the worlds of the church, others by the Bishop of the Episcopal Church.
Zacristija – a parapia management body made up of world leaders, in July, expressed concern at the bishop that the bishop "will try to spend" the zacritus, although it did not appoint architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained that the bishop lacked transparency.
Rikily in California injured the recipient of a 13-year-old lobster
The officers reported that on Saturday, the shark attacked a 13 - year - old boy when he was in California on the day of the opening of the omar season.
It was buried 7 hours ago in the morning Ensinitas near the beach of Light.
Chad Hamelis San Diego's KSWB-TV show said that on Saturday morning he broke up with friends about half an hour when he heard the boy calling for help, and then he walked back with the group to help him get out of the water.
Hamelis told me at first that the boy was worried when he got a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting: “I am so excited!
I'm impressed!"
Hamelis said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that all his keys were broken.
"I called out to everyone to get out of the water, "The sharks are floating in the water," Hamelis added.
The boy was abducted by a plane to the San Diego Children's Hospital, where he was recognized to be critical.
What kind of boy was attacked by a shark, not known.
The rescue captain, Larry Giless, told the media that a shark had been observed in that area a few weeks ago, but it was decided that it was not a dangerous species of sharks.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries from the upper part of the body.
The officers closed the beach from Casablanca Ponto to Ensinitas Swami for 48 hours.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to commit to the UK's beauty market
"Sainsbury's" takes "Boots", "Superrug" and "Debenhams" with the beauty sections of the universal shop style where specialists will work.
Actively moving to the UK’s 2.8 billion-weighted sterling beauty market, which continues to grow and the sales of fashion and household goods are shrinking, more beauty items will be tested by 11 sales outlets across the country and, if they are successful, more shops will be installed next year.
Investment in beauty is growing, and shopping centres are looking for ways to use a table, sometimes for televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's reported that it would double its beauty range to 3,000 product names, including signs such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing "L'Oreal", "Maybelline" and "Burt's Bees" range will also get more local brands in areas similar to those in stores like "Boots".
The shopping centre also re-issues its “Boutique” makeup range, most of which are vegan products – this is increasingly required by younger buyers.
In addition, the Fragranance Shop will test discounts in two Sainsbury's shops, from which the first week of which opened in Croatia, South London, was last week, and the second one will open later this year in Seli Ouke, Birmingham.
Due to the purchase of the internet and the desire to buy small quantities of local retail stores, shopping centres need to do more to attract people to visit there.
The Director General of Sainsbury's Mike's Coupe said that the company's shops are increasingly like universal stores, as the sales centres' networks are trying to fight against selling goods that are cheaper to Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and not food.
Sainsbury's has included Argo's shops in hundreds of stores and has also installed many Habitat stores, because two years ago, both networks were purchased, which, as it is claimed, strengthened the sale of food and their acquisition was more profitable.
The previous attempt by the mall to update its beauty and medicine department was unsuccessful.
In the beginning of the first decade of this century, Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots, but the union ended up arguing how to distribute revenues from pharmaceutical shops in malls.
A new strategy arose after Sainsbury's sold 125 million pounds a year ago to the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network in its 281 pharmaceutical stores.
It was said that Lloyds' contribution to this plan was added to the extended range of luxury leather care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Sainsbury's commercial director Paul Mills-Hicks said: "We have changed the exterior and atmosphere of beauty to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be prepared to give advice.
The range of our trademarks has been designed to meet every need, and because of the attractive environment and comfortable places we are now a beautiful place that challenges the old way of buying."
Peter Jones is "accompanied" because Holly Willoughby stopped his 11 million-weight sterling transaction with him.
The Dragons Den star Peter Jones "entered" after the TV show leader Holly Willoughby stopped the 11 million-weight sterling transaction with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
H. Willoughby no longer has time for their home circulation and accessories brand "Truly".
The couple’s business was compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand.
The 37-year-old "This Morning" has been reported out in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left a profitable mark of lifestyle in order to focus on his new major contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, caught the Dragons Den star Peter Jones.
The sources say that Jones was "accommodated" when a gold television girl at his business empire headquarters in Marlou (Bakingamshire) admitted that she will not be given enough time for a new transaction of up to 1.5 million sterlings for his household’s supplies and accessories brand Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand, and was expected to double H. Willoughby’s 11 million weight sterling assets.
As 37 years of age H. Willoughby reported the remaining Truly in the Instagram account, Jones leaves Britain to one of his summers.
The source said that Truly has so far been one of Holly's most important priorities.
This should have been her long - term future, lasting over the next few decades.
Its decision to leave was unusually surprising.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday because the beginning was so close.
The Marlou is full of ready-to-sale warehouses in Marlou."
Experts believe that the "The Morning" lead, which is one of the most financially successful stars in the UK, can cost the company millions because of the high investment in products, starting at the backside and ending at the end of the clothes and household items, as well as the delay in starting things.
And that could be the end of a long friendship.
Three children’s mother, H. Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have maintained close contact with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for decades.
In 2016, H. Willoughby and T. Cappu established Truly, and 52 years of P. Jones joined the fight as president.
The couple are holidaying together and Mr Jones has 40% of the shares of Baldwin's production company.
H. Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace ITV series I'm A Celebrity lead Ant McPartlin.
The close source of Jones said yesterday: "We will not know his business."
We talked hard and “then we fell in love ”
He laughed at the criticism received from the media about the comment presented, which some might consider to be "unpresidential", and because he was so positively responding to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trumpas give up so much?
With a little confidence, the "new leader" said:
"I didn't say anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was held a major step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
However, nuclear disarmament negotiations are under way.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's highest ranking diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders on Saturday at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not receive a "response" from the United States due to the early disarmament of North Korea.
He noted that instead of continuing the sanctions to maintain the pressure, the United States continued.
In his speech, he expressed a much more optimistic attitude.
"We are well followed by North Korea," he said.
– We're going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We now support these excellent relations."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had led to positive results: the completion of the missile tests, the relief of savings, and the return of the support of American home soldiers.
He defended his unusual attitude by talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be a president, but instead of having 10,000 people who want to get into this crowded arena, we'll have about 200 people standing here," said Shortas, pointing to the mine facing him.
Indonesian tsunamis and earthquakes devastated the island, killing hundreds of people
Following the earthquake of Lombok, foreign non-governmental organisations were notified that their assistance was not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the inhabitants of Lomboko were deployed, this has not been announced in the national disaster – a necessary condition for providing international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it was very clear that there is no need for international aid, and that is why it is a bit difficult," said Sumbun.
Although the rescue of children is preparing a team that will travel to Pala, it is not clear whether foreign workers will be able to work on the spot.
The representative of the National Disaster Agency Sutopo said that the Indonesian officials were assessing the situation of Paul in order to know whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
In the light of the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country has not yet prepared for natural disasters.
Although the shelters from the tsunami were built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
Due to the apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens, Paul, despite the announced warning, was likely to increase the lives of the dead.
Most of the time traveling between many Indonesian islands is difficult.
In the face of natural disasters, logistics is becoming even more complex.
Lomboke, a decommissioned hospital ship that treats victims of earthquakes, is sailing to Palu, but the new disaster will reach its destination at least three days later.
President Yoko Widodo chose the restoration of Indonesia's broken infrastructure in the centre of his election campaign, he generously issued money to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding did not give peace to the Yoko administration, as it will again take part in the elections in the coming years.
Noko is also under pressure from the remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims adhere to more conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands escaped from their homes, for Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with cats, guns, and other simple weapons.

Parliament's statues have been hit by the last blow of the "historic rewriting" dispute.
Its removal would be poetic justice for the destruction of the cultural and religious heritage of the Taliban, for which the fanatic followers of Cromwell Puritans are responsible.
However, Cromwell’s friend, J. Crick, described the proposal as “a stupidity” and “a attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “During the current discussions on the transfer of the statues to the House of Westminster, the statue of Oliver Cromwell had to be a peaceful one.
Cromvelis did not call for and implement the iconoclassism of English civil war.
Perhaps not that Cromwell will be sacrificed for what Father Tom did in the last century.
The beautiful image of the Cromwell, created by Sero William Hamo Thorneycrofto, is part of the 19th century's perspective and the figure that many still value to be respected.
Goldsmith The Sunday Telegraph said: “Many people, perhaps by the end of the 19th century, were considered to be the defender of parliament from external pressure, and this, of course, was the monarchy.
Whether this is completely accurate, historically disputed so far.
One thing is clear that the 17th - century conflict formed a later development of our nation, and Cromvelis became an exceptional figure representing one of the sides of this estate.
For this is the gain of the LORD, and of his praise, and of his praise.
The pig killed a Chinese farmer mortally
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in the Southwestern Chinese market.
On Sunday, Morning Post reported that he had found a dead man named Yuan. Because of the damaged artery he was entombed in blood and lying next to a pig in the Liupansu turg, Guidju Province (South China).
On 30 May 2005, the pig breeder in Sining (Chinghai Province, China) prepared to inject the vaccine into pigs in pigs.
He reported that on Wednesday, along with his half brother from the neighboring province of Junan, he intends to travel to the markets to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, the half brother found his family dead and found a door opened to the nearby village.
And he said, There was in the swine a great multitude, and his mouth was filled with blood.
As stated in the report, the Court’s expert confirmed that the pig weighing 250 kilograms had hit the farmer.
"Guyang Evening News" quoted as saying: "My cousin's legs were bleeding and injured," said the cousin, who named himself Wu, .
The protective camera filmed material showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
A man who had been killed by Yuan or his half brother did not belong to him.
The Turkish leader reported "Evenning News", that the pig had to be locked away from other people, and keep up until the police collect evidence on the spot.
It is reported that the Yuan family and the Turkish authorities are indicted for the compensation of death.
Although few, however, the cases of pigs attacking people were recorded earlier.
In 2016 the pig attacked the woman and her husband in the farm in Massachusetts, and the man was particularly dangerously injured.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 295 pounds [295 kg] pressed the farmer Velso to the tractor and pressed it until the animal was taken by his wife.
After the pigs sat down on the Oregano farmer in 2012, a manitobo farmer, CBC News, said that pigs are not usually aggressive, but aggression can lead to the price of blood.
"They're just playful.
They like to have a little bit of fun, very smart... who don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them accordingly," he said.
"The Roosevelts" brought a lot of things to the U.S. South
It is predicted that the hurricane is weakening by moving through the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring plenty of rain to all North Mexico and the United States.
On Sunday from 5 o'clock in the morning, Rosa moved 137 km/h as a Category 1 hurricane and was 620 km south of the Euchenian Peninsula (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, on the edge of the Pacific, it begins to form an extended area of low pressure and moves east, towards the western coast of the United States. As Roza approaches the California Peninsula on Monday as an atoll storm, it will begin to carry large atolls humidity to the north, to the south of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico.
In the coming days, wet season, interacting with the approaching low pressure area, will bring heavy rains to the south.
Instead of 2.5 to 10 centimeters of rain, it will cause dangerous sudden flooding, crash flow, and possible debris in the desert.
Due to the high humidity in some places, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona, the rainfall ranges from 5 to 8 centimeters per hour.
5 to 8 centimeters of rain is expected in the south-west regions, particularly in the main part of Arizona.
As a result of the nature of the surrounding rains, sudden floods and rapid deterioration conditions were observed.
In the course of the storms of the atolls, a particularly poor idea would be to attract the dusty feet.
The heavy rains can turn the canyons into flowing rivers, and the percussion would cause wind and dust.
The approaching low pressure area will bring some local heavy rains to the southern coast of California.
It is expected that more than 1 centimeter of droplets can cause a small drop in flow and the roads can become smooth.
This would be the first drop in the wet season in the region.
Some of the ferrets will begin to approach Arizona’s late Sunday and early Monday, and then rain will spread late on Monday and Tuesday.
The great rains after Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Juttus will rise on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
The cave can be intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, because the Arctic is famous, but the surrounding area will be quite warm.
This sometimes leads to major changes in temperature in small distances.
On Sunday, there was a great example of major temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperature of Kansas Sichi (Egypt) and Omaha (Nebraska) is almost 20 degrees different from the temperature of St. Louis and Di Moino (Ajova).
Over the next few days, maintaining summer heat should increase and cover more places.
It is expected that in the major central and eastern parts of the United States, from the Great South to the north-east areas, the warmest October with a much prevailing temperature of degrees 27.
New York temperature should rise to 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that in the eastern United States the first half of October will be higher than the average multiannual temperature.
More than 20 million people attended the Bretto Kavanaugh court meeting
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday during the six television broadcasts, observing the devastating remarks made by the Supreme Court candidate Bretto Kavanaugh and Christiane Blasey Ford in the 1990s.
However, the political divide continued after the broadcasters had interrupted regular programmes on Friday's last minute change: the Arizona Senator had an agreement to conduct a weekly investigation of the year's accusations by the FTB.
Ford to the Senate Court Committee said it was absolutely true that when Kavanaugh was in high school, she was robbed and tried to take off her clothes.
Kavanaugh falsely testified that he was absolutely true that it was not.
Nielsen reported on Friday that there may have been more than 20.4 million people watching the broadcast.
The company calculated the average number of viewers viewing the broadcast through CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has certain difficulties in calculating persons watching television in offices.
In order to explain more clearly, it is an audience of the same size as would have occurred during the repetitive football matches or the Oscar awards.
Nielsen reported that Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh's candidacy, led all networks when the number of viewers reached an average of 5.69 million throughout the day's trial.
ABC, waiting for 3.26 million viewers, was in second place.
Nielsen reported that CBS received 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, CNN 2.52 million.
A great deal of interest remained after the trial.
The main feature of the Friday drama was Flake’s.
After a small Republican Bureau issued a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, it was seized on Friday morning by CNN and CBS cameras, when the protestors called on him, trying to lift him to a meeting of the Court Committee.
CNN filmed it directly with the eyes cast down when it was flooded by people.
"I am standing here before you," said one woman.
– Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
He was told: “You have power when many women are helpless. ”
Flake said that his office issued a statement and, before closing the elevator, added that he would have to say more at the meeting of the Court Committee.
The cable television and broadcasting networks were subsequently discussed directly when the Court Committee voted in favour of Kavanaugh's candidacy to the Senate.
However, Flake said that this would only be done by knowing that the FTB would investigate charges against the candidate during the next week, whose investigation was called for by a minority of Democrats.
Flake, speaking to his friend, Senator Chris Coons, was partly convinced.
After speaking with Coons and several senators, Flake’s decision was taken.
Flake’s choice had power, as it was evident that the Republicans would not have a vote to approve the Kavanaugh investigation.
President Trumpas launched an FTB investigation into suspicions against Kavanaugh.
Britain's Prime Minister blames critics for "playing politics" about "Brexit"
The Prime Minister Theresa May accused her plans to leave the critical people of the European Union in a Sunday Times interview with the future of Britain and in order to harm the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservatory Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In the next interview, published after her photo on the first page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Brexit Plan for "Sašikų" that the United Kingdom and the EU should collect each other's tariffs, and said it was "a total absurdity".
Shooting of Wayde's Sims Police arrested suspect Dieteon Simpson for LSU's death
Police arrested a person suspected of shooting at a 20-year-old LSU basketball player in Wayde’s death.
Baton Ružo Police Department reported that 20-year-old Ditheon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned after he was sentenced to a second degree murder.
The officials published a video of Sims and Simpson’s capture, and the police pointed out that Sims had left his eyes during the marches.
The "CBS" branch of "WAFB" reports that the police took the glasses from the scene and found Simpson DNA on them.
After questioning Simpson, the police reported that he had killed Wayde.
The lawyer informs that his release security is $350 000.
The Eastern Baton Ružo Parapsian Professional Service issued a preliminary report on Friday, which mentions that the cause of death is a bullet in the head, turning to the neck.
The division is awarded to the police working group of the state of Louisiana, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the people of the region who assisted in the investigation during which the suspect was arrested.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the area for its legal protection for the "cruelness and enforcement of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
1,98 feet tall boy grew up in Baton Ruz, where his father Wayne also played basketball LSU.
Last season, the young man averaged 5,6 points in the game and won 2,6 detachment ball.
On Friday morning LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "blow" and "shocked".
"It's always thought about it," Wade said.
Firebreaks in the Gulf of Mexico City
Out of the Popokatepetil fiery furnace, the donkeys reached the southern outskirts of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans to keep away from the fire department when the activation of the crater was recorded and 183 times the emissions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was watching a lot of earthquakes and earthquakes.
The photos on the social media show the fine ash layer covered by the car front glasses in the Mexican neighborhood, e.g. Chočimilke.
Geophysics observed that 72 km in the morning of the city’s volcanic activity increased when the earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The fire department, named Don Gojo, has been active since 1994.
Prior to the vote on independence, the annual police met with Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the protestors met with the police for independence and thousands joined the opposition demonstrations in order to mention the first annual separation vote against Catalonia.
When the group of separatists stopped, the police were covered with eggs and powder. This caused dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
The police used the ladders to stop the shells that started the day later.
Within hours, the group for independence, singing "Do not forget, do not forgive", met with Union protestors who called out: "Life Spain!"
The local press reported that fourteen people were being treated for minor injuries suffered through protests.
Years after the referendum on 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal, but which is condemned by the Catalan separatists, the tensions in the independence region persist.
Most voters decided to become independent, but due to a large majority of the votes cast, the number of voters who did not wish to be separated was low.
According to the Catalan authorities, last year, almost 1,000 people were injured during the violent clashes with police throughout the region in an attempt to stop the vote in the electoral district.
On Friday night, the independence group set up a camp to prevent demonstrations by national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to change the route.
For 68 years, electric Narcissus Termess, who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said that he was no longer real about the prospect of Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we survived one of the best moments.
I watched parents shout joyfully at the people who can vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite the fact that last December in the regional elections there was an important and serious victory, the independence of Catalonia's parties has been difficult to maintain this year's speed, when many of their most well-known leaders have withdrawn into a voluntary trial or are held and are awaiting the court's role in organising a referendum and later in proclaiming independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic John Puigas, filming a protest on his phone, said that the conflict had been created by politicians on both sides.
"Employment is constantly growing," he said.
On Saturday, Orioli Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned in pre-trial prison since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Calling for elections in the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repression demonstrated by the Spanish government," he said.

The Mengos hit the Livingston victory 1:0 against the Rangers
Livingston player Dolly Menga's first turn guaranteed victory
In the higher league, Livingston surprised Rangers, forcing Steven Gerrard to lose the second of the 18 matches, the head of the Ibrox Club.
The Dolly Mengos hit was very important because the Gary Holto team compared it to "Hibernian".
The Gerardo team will meet with the Heads of Hearts, from which they will be left with eight points during the season of the Premier League.
Before this Thursday, the European Rangers League games at home with Vienna Rapid.
Livingston then extended its unparalleled series of unparalleled games in the division to six, and coach Holt has not yet felt the taste of losing, because Kenny Miller only changed last month.
"Livingston" for the chance to play games with romantic guests
Even before Holto's team was introduced because of its resilience, which caused the various problems of Rangers, it had to be in front of it long ago.
Initially, Scott Robinson crossed and knocked across the door, later Alan Lithgow failed to reach the head of Craig Halkett's handcuff, and this one stopped at the door.
The landlords, allowing the Rangers to play in front, were not upset because they knew that they could cause trouble in creating standard situations.
That was the case with the intention of getting involved.
Rangers passed the free blow and Livingston took the lead; Declan Gallagher and Robinson passed the ball to Mengai, and this man stopped it and earned the input from the center of the fine.
Since then, the ball has been more controlled by Rangers, but the protection of the owners has been ineffective and the consumer Liam Kelly has hardly been able to work.
Such a vague game went on and on the second floor, although Kelly had to work to unlock Alfredo Morelos' blow at the door.
Scott Pittman's gunman Allan McGregor fired his leg, and after another standard situation, the ball was sent to the front of the gate by the Lithgow.
When the ball was handed over, it was constantly on the scene of the Livingston penalty, but every time it was blown away, and the two requirements for the penalty were one for the encounter with Glenn Middleton after the change site and the other for the fall of the ball were not satisfied.
Analysis of the phenomenal appearance of Livingston
BBC Scotland Reporter Alasdair Lamont from Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal "Livingston" game and result.
For all up to one they were excellent and continued to exceed expectations for the ever-increasing game.
The style of the game and the staff from the return to the highest level almost did not change, but the great rewards should be given to Holt as he came to set up the team.
He's had a lot of giants.
Captain Halkett was a great player in a well-organized defense, and Menga was worth Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall not to lose their wake.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they play well with Gerard, this time they lacked much in order to reach their level.
They had little impact and only one time passed through the defense of the owners. A certain alarm call was made for the Rangers team in the middle of the table.
Erdogan Kelne was met in different ways
On Saturday (September 29th), there were smiles and blue skies, when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, when the aim was to restore relations between NATO allies.
The leaders argued about issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open up a new large castle.
The largest Turkish population community outside Turkey is located in the city.
The police banned the 25 000 people gathered from fighting in front of the mosque for security, but many foreigners came to see their president.
These protestors against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also sought to be heard condemning both Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to accept it in their own country.
Various protests show the disunity of visitors: some German Turks consider him to be a giant, while others call him a dictator.
Road accident in Deptford. When the car was in the car, a driver died.
In London, a driver died in a car crash.
An accident took place near Beswod and Evelyn Streets, on the Journey of Deptford Road, in the morning of the city, about 10.15 a.m. BVL.
The driver stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
A few months later, when another bicyclist was killed on Childers Street, the defendant was separated from the defendant who then fled, and the accident occurred about 1.6 km from the accident that occurred on Saturday.
The city police said that officials are trying to identify the person and inform his closest relatives.
The roads are closed and the bus routes are changed, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartino Prison. Six officers injured during the crash
The Prison Service reported that six prison officials were severely injured during the arrest of special security officers.
The crash took place in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Vusteršyre on Sunday at 9.30 a.m. BVL, where it continues.
Special Tarnado officials were set up to manage this riot involving eight prisoners and taking place in one prison wing.
Officials are treated from minor facial injury at the site.
The representative of the prison department said: “In order to manage the ongoing incident in the HMP Long Lartin prison, specially trained prison staff were set up.
Six staff were treated for injury.
We are not tolerating violence in our prisons and we are to ensure that responsible people will be given to the police and, possibly, will spend longer time than to play."
The HMP Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that a prison manager was being treated in the hospital after he was attacked by a potassium.
In the past year, officials were sent to prison to deal with a serious disturbance, some of which had been covered with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens with its sudden floods in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Solt Leik Siči (it can be useful for the harsh areas)
It is not normal for the atrical depression to hit Arizona, but that is what is likely to happen next week when the hurricane of Rosa with her remaining energy will fall through the south of the desert and this will result in a sudden flood risk.
The National Meteorology Service has already announced the observation of the sudden flood on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona, spreading south and east Nevada, southern California and Juts, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Solt Leave Site.
It is expected that on Monday, when the rain approaches, Rosa will return directly to Phoenix on Tuesday.
In Finland, the National Weather Service noted that only “ten athropogenic cyclones have maintained the status of athropogenic storms or athropogenic depression not longer than 322 miles [322 km] from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane not more than 64 kilometres from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre are expected to reach 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall and to reach 5 centimeters in some areas of Arizona Mogolon Rim.
Other areas of the south-west desert, including the central Walls and the Great Basin, are likely to fall from 2.5 to 5 centimeters and can fall up to 10 centimeters.
For people with no sudden floods, the pink rains can be a blessing because the region is suffering from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these chills can be useful because the south evenings are now suffering from droughts.
According to the US drought monitoring centre, a little more than 40% of Arizona suffers from very high drought, and this corresponds to the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa travels across the coast across the California Peninsula, which belongs to Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa, still equivalent to the hurricane category of 137 km/h, is 619 km south of the Euchenian Peninsula (Mexico) and moves north at 19 km per hour.
The Audra encounters colder waters in the Pacific region and is therefore severe.
So it is expected that it will reach the Mexican border with the outdoors on Monday afternoons or evenings.
Critics that occur in certain parts of Mexico may be significant and may pose a high risk of flooding.
"From the California Peninsula to the north-west Sonor is expected to wait between 8 and 15 centimeters, but, possibly, up to 25 centimeters of droplets", said weather.com.
Then Rosa will retreat north through Mexico as an atoll, then on Tuesday morning, reach Arizona's border as an atoll depression, and on Tuesday evening through Arizona, she will retreat south to Juta.
"The main risk expected from Rose or its residues is a very high amount of rain on the California Peninsula, the North West Sonor and the South Pacific," the National Hurricane Centre reported.
These rains are believed to cause life - threatening sudden floods, droughts, and droughts in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsummer Norton. Catch four people suspected of attempted murder

It is a short saying that Kavanaugh "hate the hostility and anger of the party of the Democrats".
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that we would like to reject the unforgivable and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party," said Shortas in his speech in Vilnius, West Virginia.
In short, Kavanaugh said that during his candidacy process, "a party of the Democrats was angry and angry".
Kavanaugh testified on Thursday to the convention strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he had sexually assaulted her several decades ago when they were still teenagers.
Ford also testified at the court hearing on his accusations.
On Saturday, the president said that “the Americans saw the day as Kavanaugh’s shows, prolific and courageous.
– The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, he is a lawyer who has a reliable reputation in the field of public services," he said.
The President indirectly recalled Kavanaugh's candidacy, while at the same time referring to the importance of Republican elections in the middle elections.
"The five weeks left for the most important elections in our lives.
I don't participate, although I really do participate," he said.
– That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
A short statement was made that the Democrats aim to "oppress and prevent".
The Senior Leader of the GOP told CNN that the first major procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place no later than Friday.
The number of victims still increasing as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
The authorities reported that at least 384 people had died, many had been killed by giant waves, when strong earthquakes and tsunamis struck the Indonesian island of Sulaves.
On Friday, people gathered at the city beach festival of Palu, when the peaks of six feet [6 m] high wave began to run, and most of them died and destroyed everything that happened on the road.
After the tsunami, an earthquake struck 7.5 degrees Fahrenheit [2.5 ° C].
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they became victims,” said BNPB, a representative of the Indonesian disaster relief agency, at the time of the information report, to press Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
“Cunamis didn’t live alone, he pulled cars, bars, houses, he hit everything on the ground”, said Nugroho and added that, before hitting the coast, the tsunamis opened the sea at a speed of 800 km/h.
He said that some people went into the trees to avoid the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to the 24 centres in Palu.
The photos of the crash agency showed that a large number of buildings and shops were destroyed and the bridges were maintained and destroyed, and the pond was covered with water.
On Saturday, the city of the sea continued to be struck again.
A series of earthquakes was felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) reported that the energy released at the time of a particularly strong earthquake on Friday was about 200 times higher than the atomic bomb, which was put on Hiroshima during World War II.
It was reported that the tsunamis could have been strengthened because of the city’s geographical location, as it stood at the end of the narrow valley.
Nugroho described the damage as "great" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been destroyed.
He said that some of the bodies of the victims had been found trapped in the ruins of the buildings, later added that 540 people were injured, and 29 people were unconscious.
Nugroho said that the number and damage of the victims may be greater beyond the coast, which is over 300 km north of Palu, in the area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The network "was completely paralyzed and therefore no information was received" from Dongal.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the representative of the Red Cross, adding that workers and volunteers go to disaster-affected areas.
It has been said that "it can already be seen as a tragedy, but the situation can worsen."
On Saturday, the agency was highly criticised for not reporting that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said that the waves had lifted the warning.
In a general social media favorite, you can hear a man standing on the top floor of a building calling for a nearby tsunami for people on the street below.
A few minutes to the edge of the beach, the water wall is breaking down the buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the filmed material.
As a result of the earthquake and tsunami, electricity supply was disrupted and communications networks around Palu were removed, and it was difficult for the authorities to coordinate aid delivery.
The authorities have reported that the military from Jakarta and other cities began to send cargo aircraft with aid supplies, but the fugitive still needs food and other necessary supplies.
The city airport was reopened only to provide aid and will be closed by October.
President Yoko Widodo planned to visit Paul's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
Doseba reported that when World Vision staff from Dongal were safely travelling to the city of Palu, where the workers were looking at the temples in the courtyards of the office.
"They told me a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief teams began taking difficult steps to provide disaster relief, some people complained that those with a lot of experience in foreign aid were forbidden to travel to Paul.
According to the Indonesian regulations, funding, provision and foreign staff can only assist when the disaster site is announced in the national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a province-level disaster,” said the Indonesian Red Cross representative to the press Aulia Arriani.
– When the government says, “Yes, this is a national disaster”, we can call for international aid, but such status has not yet been announced.”
The second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday Paul, close friends and neighbors hoped that their loved ones would become part of a miracle that would affect the neural history of disasters.
A small boy was pulled out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been pushed after her mother’s body for two days.
The national team of Indonesian paraspars sports coach Gendon Subdono was trained by two great Asian players who ended up in Indonesia earlier this month.
Other of Roa Roa's guests, including Mandag, were his students.
"When I'm older in parasparnia sports, I carry my emotional burden," he said.
Gendona told us in detail how in a few hours after announcing the collapse of Roa Roa's hotel, this knowledge took place after the parasparnia sports community. He volunteered to send messages using the WhatsApp programme, to Paul's competitors who participated in the beach festival.
However, his message contained only one gray, not two blue beads.
"I think this means that the messages were not received," he said.

Kanye West. Reperis changed his name to Ye
Reperis Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, after announcing changes in the Twitter account, he wrote: “A person previously known as Kanye Wests”.
For 41 years, Mr. West has been known as Ye and on this behalf he named the eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes began before the show "Saturday Night Live", where Westas was expected to present his new album "Yandhi".
This is what he has to change the singer Ariana Granda, who called off the show for "emotional reasons," said the show's creator.
This is not only a reduction in the current professional name – Mr West said earlier that this word has religious significance for him.
"I think that "ye" is the word most commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," – earlier this year, Mr. West said about the title of the album with the radio leader Big Boy."
“So I am you, I am us, that means us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and the verse is Ye, which means the reflection of our good, evil, panic, everything.
The album reflects more on what we are."
He's one of the many well-known rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced the name “Love and Brotherly Love. ”
A former colleague of Westo JAY-Z also changed his name and used it with or without a brush.
Mexican politics Andrés Manuel López Obradar (shortly AMLO) promises not to use war against civilians.
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obradar, promised never to use military forces against civilians when the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of the repression against students.
On Saturday, López Obradar promised at the "Tlatelolco" site "never use military forces to harass the Mexicans".
On October 2, 1968, at the time of the movement of left-wing students in Latin America, military officials shot at a peaceful demonstration on the site, killing 300 people.
López Obradar made a solemn promise to support young Mexicans each month by subsidizing students and opening more free state universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities include young people in criminal groups.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence
"As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount released for research in this field," says an investor and expert in artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, working on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were received after the various US government authorities published reports on artificial intelligence, even though the US is not in general an official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, in the past year China presented its plan to take the lead in artificial intelligence innovations by 2030.
"The enhanced research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the US and are expected in the field of other advanced artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Double funding could double the likelihood that another major achievement of artificial intelligence will be the US, as Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "The Superintendents of Artificial Intelligence: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Director General of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face +.
In the ninth decade of Carnegie Mellon at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked with an artificial intelligence system that won the U.S. top-ranking player Othello and was later head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged the previous US government technology competitions, such as the Robotik challenge of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research projects, and asked when there would be others to help find more intelligent people.
Lee said that US scientists often have to make a difficult effort to win state grants.
"It's not China that attracts academic leaders – they're companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired bright university minds to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that the changes in immigration policy can also help the US strengthen efforts on the issue of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should be offered automatically to doctors working in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council announced its new generation's artificial intelligence development plan.
In addition, Lee said that the Chinese National Science Fund is funding people from academic institutions, like the National Science Fund and other government organisations, to allocate money to US scientists, but the academic quality of work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the US Department of Defence set up a Joint Centre of Artificial Intelligence, which aims to include partners from the industry and the academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee of Artificial Intelligence.
This month DARPA (the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects) announced about US$2 billion investment for the AI Next initiative.
NSF is currently investing in artificial intelligence research over $100 million a year.
However, in the coming months, nothing has been done about US legislation aimed at establishing the National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The Macedonians voted in the Sunday referendum on whether to change the name of the country as the Republic of North Macedonia, an action that would resolve the long-term dispute with Greece, which has blocked its efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, in which the province of Macedonia is situated, claims that its name of its northern neighbour means claims to Greece and veto Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but the opponents told nationalists that the name change would harm the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonian Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanova said that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts as to whether the voter activity would reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to enter into force.
The question of the referendum on the voting card was put: "Are you a member of NATO and the EU in agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that Macedonia, one of the countries that have broken Yugoslavia, is worth paying the price to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the country's future, the young of Macedonia, so that they can live freely, protect the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the results of the vote and make them decisive.
The name is to be replaced by the two-thirds majority of Parliament.
The National Elections Commission reported that there were no reports of violations up to 1 p.m.
However, the voter activity was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent during the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of the vote was cast.
"I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old elector of Skopje.
Macedonian MP Zoran Zaevas, his wife Zorica and his son Duška vote in a referendum held in Macedonia on the change of country name in order to open the way to the NATO and European Union. Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
Prior to the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkova prepared a small scene and pulled the seats in front of the tent building the boycotting referendum.
"We are behind NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up rather than enter through the door of the servants," Kavadarkov said.
– We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can return to others, such as China and Russia, and participate in the European integration."
Prime Minister Zaevas said that NATO's membership in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent, would attract the necessary investments.
"I believe that the majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are favourable to the EU and NATO," Zaevas said after giving his vote.
He said that the result of "Yes" would be "a guarantee of our future".
According to the Macedonian Institute of Research, 30 to 43 per cent of voters should participate in the referendum last Monday, less than the required voter activity.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonian TV Telma, 57% of respondents are preparing for the Sunday vote.
70 percent of them said they would vote Yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, it must take part in 50 per cent of voters plus one vote.
If the referendum failed, it would have been the first serious failure of the pro-Pro-Kriet government policy since it took over power last May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero wins the entire Brighton defense and profit intake
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling won the Brighton defense, and the Manchester City team won the 2nd victory on Saturday, playing Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's 65-minute ingestion seems unlikely to be easy.
Argentinian attacker got the ball in the middle of the square at the start of the attack.
Before going out into the open field, he walked between the three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four players wearing green masks.
He broke through one defender, before the "Brightton" fined on the edge of a few others.
Then he turned the ball to the left where he was Sterling.
The English attacker returned the ball to Aguero in one flash from the fine ground and this right leg hit the ball to the right side of the gate network, winning the Brighton Bay of Mathew Ryan.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," the city manager Pepas Guardiola told reporters.
– We talked about him playing 55 to 60 minutes.
That's how it was.
We were lucky that he earned the input that moment."
However, it was Sterling who helped the first Sky Blues to get ahead in these Primer League matches.
The revenue was paid in 29 minutes.
At the time of the attack, Aguero received the ball at the bottom of the Brighton Square.
On the left side of the square between the two opponents, he kindly transferred the ball to Leroy’s Sane.
In Sane, several sparrows pushed the ball forward until Sterling swooped toward the further rope.
The Sky Blues shooter launched the ball at the door even before crossing from the edge of the square.

Sherzer wants to play friendly games with Rockies
After the Nationals dropped out of the open competition, there was no need to repress for important reasons.
After a competitive award by Scherzer, they hope to win Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have the opportunity to remain in the open competitions; in the national league "West" they score one point "Los Angeles Dodgers".
“Rockies”, score 5:2 won by “Nationals”, at least already secured the chance to get a preferential path, but will still have to try to ensure the right to play the first division.

Why aren't you sick?"
Nationals has not yet announced the start-up team on Sunday, but in this case they throw the ball is clearly willing to release Scherzer.
Sherzers, who will be in the building on the 34th of this game, took on Thursday the year's training and the ethics' position on the usual day of rest for him on Sunday.

A Short Language in West Virginia
Speaking of the important activity of the Republican voters in the mid-term elections, the President shall take an indirect note of the situation regarding the appointment of Bretto Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
"All that we have achieved will be put on the table in November.
The five weeks left for the most important elections in our lives.
It's very important, I'm not running... but I'm actually running, that's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Then he continued: "You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see how it is happening right now.
And they're willing to come back to power by any means, you see how low it is, how bad it is.
They don't care what they've done, what they've been through to get power and control; that's what they really want – power and control – but we won't give them that."
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to "oppress and prevent".
"And you've seen it for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "poisons, horrors, earthly policing and wrong people."
He referred to the Senate Judicial Committee, referring to the name of the Senator of Democratics Diana’s Feinstein, which resulted in the ovation of large audiences.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you delete the document?
Ø, hmm, like.
No, um... no, I'm waiting for one – it was really a loose body language – the worst body language of all I've ever seen."
Liborists have lost the diversity of opinions.
They do not tolerate those who openly express their opinion
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for my mistrust, I said that it was necessary to monitor it.
Finally, I am the latest of the Lebanese parliamentarians who have been told that I am unwelcome, and that is for my opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, called for similar threats because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
My distrust was expressed by criticizing me for not meeting with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of economic policy, for national security, for Europe, for irony, for similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East Labour meeting said on Friday that "we want many members to be involved and meetings to be productive."
Most of the eight-year-olds, when I am the local Parliamentarian of the Libyan Party, the meetings of the GC on Friday evenings were exactly the same.
It is sad that today's tons of meetings are not so much the "slower, more pleasant" policy promises to be forgotten long ago, even if it has been in general ever.
It is increasingly evident that another opinion is intolerable in the Libyan Party and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is accepted by the Party’s leadership.
This started shortly after the party leader became Jeremy, and colleagues, whom I had previously believed to be similar, began to expect that I would go around 180 degrees and follow the opinions I would never agree with – whether on national security or on the EU single market.
As soon as I speak in public – and even no matter what – social networks have been investigating the abuses that encourage my withdrawal, the policy of the centre is being condemned and said that I am not a place in the Lebanese party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I have achieved something more than some of my colleagues because the comments I have made are political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to face a wave of sexist and racist insults every day.
One of the most disappointing things in this political era is how insults have become a normal phenomenon.
Jeremy Corbyna said last week that the Leiborist party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a party of the same views, and with each 'distrust' procedure or a change in the electoral system, this party is getting smaller.
Over the past two years, I have received much advice not to jump, not to speak so loud, and then “everything will be fine with me. ”
But that's not what I came for.
Since I joined the Liberal Party 32 years ago, as a scientist, I have been provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which, in fact, broke my entire school class in that sense, I have sought to secure better public services for those who need it most – whether as a member of the local council or as a minister of the government.
I have never hidden my policies, including the recent elections.
No one in the Nottingham East had to be surprised in any way about my political opinions and disagreements with the current leaders.
To those who have promoted this procedure on Friday, I can say that when the country goes towards Brexit, from which the households, businesses and public services are affected, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Leiborist Party.
But in fact, one message I have for the Notable Momentum, for my voters, for members of the Leiborist Party (or not): I am proud to be able to serve you and promise that no threats of revocation or political precision will prevent me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and your best interests.

“Ayr”-“Melrose” – 38:17 Unaffected “Ayr” attacks the tops of the tables
Two late tests have failed the final results, but there is no doubt that "Ayr" has earned a prize in this triumphal moment in the events of the Tennent's Premiership.
Now the team was on the top of the table – the only one unaffected.
Finally, they were brought to an unprecedented defense and well-exploited opportunity, so coach Peter Murchie can really feel satisfied.
"We've had all the trials in all the games that have been going on so far, and we're still unbeatable, so I'm really happy," he said.
Robin Christie from Melrose said: "Ayr" turned out well, players took advantage of their chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson’s 14th minute trial, which resulted in the completion of Frazier Climo, took Air ahead, but the yellow card shot Rory Hughes, who was released to the square by Warriors, allowed Melrose to collect the numbers, and Baggot stopped the unsuccessful attempt.
Clima increased the advantage of Ayr, when previously, through the middle of the competition, he earned points and successfully completed his personal test by helping Ayr before the break-up of the result 17:5.
However, the second root of Melrose started not bad, and Patrick Anderson’s attempt, which resulted in the completion of Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
The matches were suspended for a longer time because Ruaridhas Knott experienced a serious trauma and was released from sight on the bridesmaids. Following the continuation of the "Ayr" matches, the race continued to run forward when Stafford McDowall finished the trial successfully.
"Ayr" Captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card and "Melrose" tried to use the player's surplus, but Bruce's Colvine's test was unsuccessful after the pressure was released.
The player of the home team returned, but, after receiving a yellow card to Struan Hutchinson for stopping Clima without a ball, MacPherson pressed the ball from the penalty line for the remaining "Ayr" plots.
The climate resulted in the completion of its test, as had been done since almost the beginning of the match-up, after Kyle’s Rowe held David Armstrong’s spirit into the square and stopped the country’s attacker Gregor Henry from holding the fifth test of the house team to win points.
Still Game star, apparently, ready to start a new career in the restaurant industry
The Still Game star Ford Kiernana seems ready to move to the accommodation and catering services sector, explaining that the director of the licensed restaurant company has been appointed.
A 56-year-old man in a popular BBC comedy plays Jack Jarvis, writes scenarios and plays together with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphyll.
The duet announced that the coming ninth season would be the last season of this row, and it seems that Kiernana is already planning her life after Kraiglang.
Officially, he became the Director of Aföringmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this fact, although the "Scottish Sun" sources remembered that Kiernana was looking for ways to engage in the "scattered restaurant business" of Glazgo.
'We belong to the sea': the ground-based Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the water
The sailors are patrolling the ship’s La Pase.
The flag of the watermelon floats on public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazon, the base of the sea is filled with a cry: “We are legally owned by the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
In all of Bolivia’s land-based, still living memories of the access to the water that we had to sacrifice to Chile in the 19th century in the bloody conflict over resources — living and long enough to be swallowed again in the Pacific.
In recent decades, the hopes of the World Court of Justice, which will be published on 1 October, have been greatly strengthened, because after five years of debate, Bolivia is awaiting the International Court of Justice.
"Bolivia is focused on the spirit of unity and peace and, of course, is willing to expect positive results," said Bolivia's diplomat Robert Calzadilla.
Many Bolivian citizens will monitor the publication of the TTT decision throughout the country on large screens, hoping that the Hague tribunal will take a positive decision on Bolivia’s complaint – Chile will be obliged to negotiate on Bolivia’s access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who is waiting for a controversial electoral fight for re-election, is also very interested as soon as the decision on Monday ends.
"We are very close to the opportunity to return to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts would like to believe that it is unlikely that the court will take a decision in favour of Bolivia, even if it would take little change.
The United Nations authority established in the Netherlands has no power to explore Chile's territory and has indicated that it will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the TTT decision will only be published six months after the last arguments were heard is unlikely or shows that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, expert in international law in Chile.
And even if Bolivia managed to make a move, for the past four years, it could be blocked back.
"This issue of access to the sea has been raised illegally by the current Bolivian administration," Záráte said.
She believes that any remnant of Chile’s good will has destroyed the fighting morale rhetoric.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the conversation at some point, but after all this discussion will be extremely difficult.
The country has not changed its ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, objected to the idea that the court decision was made unusually quickly.
"In the morning, Bolivia will have the unique opportunity to start new relations with Chile era and end the 139-year-old disagreements for mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales is still one of the most popular Latin American presidents, and uses the sea as a political manipulation.
"Bolivia will never promise to have the right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to agree with the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho believes that his people will never return to nuclear weapons unless they can trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep its promises, which led the rival countries to agree at a meeting in Singapore.
His comments were made at the time when the Secretary of State, Michael Pompeo, saw the intention to renew the imposed nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting with Kim Jong Unu in Singapore.
Ri says that the Utopian dream is that the continuation of sanctions and the rejection of a declaration concerning the end of the Korean War would at some time be possible for North Korea to be blocked.
Washington is prevented from accepting the declaration if, first of all, Pchenjana does not commit any convincing acts of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Short wants to hold a second meeting.
However, the widespread skepticism of the fact that Pchenjana does not seriously intend to renounce the arsenal, which the country seems to see as the only guarantor of its security.
Pompeo is going to visit Pchenjane next month to prepare the ground for the second meeting of Kim and Short.
The Paris fashion show was revealed that the latest trend is massive head coverings, and they will soon close the nearest fashion shop
If you want to supplement your flight collection or fully protect from the sun, this trend is just for you.
The designers Valentino and Thomas Browne presented a wide range of eccentricly large head coverings in his 2019 spring and summer collections, and he simply highlighted the views of the Paris fashion week.
These particularly unpracticed flights closed the social network "Instagram" this summer, and these designers presented eye-catching works on the podium.
The distinguished design of Valentino was a huge body color fly, decorated with a broad, plumbing edge, capping the head of the manikin.
Other non-standard-size accessories have been priced orbs, ticket and even ananas — but they are not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thomas Browne also presented a collection of strange rubbers – at the same time to Helovin.
Many colorful masks were touched with lips and reminded Hannibal of Lecter’s superior fashion.
One of the works looked like a member’s costume, with a tube and underwater glasses, and the other remembered the soluble ice.
And if you get this huge fashion trend, don't ask.
Stylish experts hope that these big envelopes can enter the shops.
The large flights were also popular with the La Bomba high-ends, and the two-legged low-end flights were already carried by all – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cultural brand of the goods, created in a very impractical way, which prevented all social networks, released another large piece of work on the podium – a core beach bag, almost the same size as the one carrying it in the washing suit to draw the manikin.
The red-plated stripe bag, decorated with rafie corners and white leather handle, became the exclusive accent of the collection "La Riviera SS19" in the Paris fashion week.
The Nationalist Luke’s Armitage said FEMAIL: “I think that the next summer, the big air and beach bags will be brought to the stores, because the designer has had such a big impact, so it would be difficult to ignore the need for non-standard accessories. ”
John Edward: “Paying talks is a very important skill for the world’s citizens”
The independent schools of Scotland have improved academic achievement records, not to be missed in 2018, and demonstrated again the outstanding results of exams, which have only further enhanced individual and collective achievements in the fields of sport, art, music and other community merits.
When more than 30,000 students are taught throughout Scotland, this school, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), aims to provide their students and their parents with the highest level of services.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and to be citizens of the world.
As we work in the education sector, which can create and implement the school programme, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and that they are collected in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you can speak with a man, he will understand your mind.
If you speak with him in his own speech, you shall speak with his heart."
It is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to forge relationships and build trust in people from other countries.
According to the results of recent reviews this year, languages are excellent at the top and in independent schools with the best maintenance ratings.
A total of 68 percent of foreign students received the highest A score.
The data collected from 74 schools that are members of SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the highest A assessment during the Mandarin language exam, 72 percent received the highest A assessment in German, and 69 percent received the highest A assessment in French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland have time to pay foreign languages with essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language, as a matter of choice, now in independent school programmes and elsewhere are considered as important as basic things (studies, technology, engineering and mathematics).
According to a survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014, 17% of the labour force had insufficient language skills for all reasons that made it difficult for employers to fill their jobs.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory for young people to prepare for their future careers.
Since employment will depend heavily on languages in the future, these skills become essential in a global world.
No matter what career a person would choose to pursue in a second language, he will be much more successful in the future if he has the skills he needs throughout his life.
When you can communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person learning a language will be much more competitive.
According to a survey conducted in 2013 involving more than 4,000 UK adults, 75 percent of the people in the foreign language were unable to speak well enough to participate in the conversation, while the French language was the only language spoken by a double percentage of people, i.e. 15 percent.
That is why it is important for children today to invest in language learning.
In teaching a number of languages, especially in developing countries, children will have a better chance of meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school varies according to the language they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom in view of the future of 2020, such as mandarins or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, there will always be many languages from which you can choose from an independent school with training staff and specialists in this area.
Scotland’s independent schools are prepared to create a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills they need to live in the future.
It is not surprising that in today's business environment, the world's language remains vital for the future of the country, and that is why it is necessary to reflect it in the education system.
In fact, modern languages should indeed be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this opportunity to choose, diversity and results for young people in Scotland.
It is necessary to do so.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron's Sunday San Diego will start a debut "Lackers"
There was little waiting for the fans to see LeBron James start the Los Angeles Lakes season.
"Lackers" coach Luke Walton reported that James is playing the opening of the Sunday season with Denver's "Nuggets" San Diego.
But for just a few minutes, it's not clear yet.
"This will be more than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
"Lackers" reporter Mikea Trudella on Twitter said that James is likely to play a limited time.
Earlier this week, James was asked about plans in the Lakers team over six pre-season games.
"At this stage of my career, I no longer need pre-season matches to prepare," he said.
Short language in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Short this evening starts his campaign in Ville, West Virginia.
This was the first of five short-tongues planned next week, including suspensions in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In the course of the vote, following the approval of the suspension procedure of the candidate for the Supreme Court chosen by him, the short-term aim is to concentrate support in the forthcoming mid-term elections, as the Republicans have been threatened by losing control in Congress in November.
A few hours later, this evening, you're going to speak Short in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
Short language in Vilnius, West Virginia, scheduled 19 hours in the morning evening, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch the short language in West Virginia in the following online version of YouTube.
The topic of candidate Bretto Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court this week will be brief, because it has suffered considerable tensions over suspicion of improper sexual behaviour when the Senate voted for the suspension of the candidate until the week until the FTB conducts the investigation.
But the main objective of this campaign is to help Republicans acquire some strength in the coming November elections.
Therefore, representatives of President Trump's campaign say that the purpose of these five meetings next week, as Reuters is announced, is to "energize volunteers and supporters, trying to defend and expand the majority of the Republicans in the Senate and the House of Representatives".
"Congress control is so important on his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible, because the campaign season is beginning very hot," said the member of the Shorto campaign, reluctant to reveal his name.
The "Villing Wesbanco" arena should attract sponsors from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of Pittsberg media", says the Western Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Shortas will visit West Virginia, the country where more than 40 percentage points were won in 2016.
A brief effort is being made to help the West Virginia candidate to the Senate, the Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is in the low-ranking rankings according to the surveys.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, as Reuters reports.
2018 “Ryder” Cup tournament: US team has decided to take a race and expect to enter Sunday’s competitions
After three personal stages on Saturday afternoon, the quarters can be just what was needed during this Ryder Cup tournament.
Such a fluctuation of success is totally designed, but players really believe it, especially in such competitions as these.
So whose side is success now?
"They've taken the lead in six points, and now in four, so I guess we can keep it such a success," said Jordan Spiethas, preparing for the day.
Europe, of course, is the first, has four points of force and is still waiting for twelve matches.
American enthusiasm, says Spietho, has spread out and they don't miss it, without talking about the shape of Spietho and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them gathered three points out of four.
The pressure was invincible from the beginning to the end and was irretrievably directed.
In order to finish the fourth match, Thomas earned two points from two possibilities.
His defeat, winning them in the 15th duo on this cat, was followed by similar rumors, which seemed to say that the end of the American team was not yet coming.
"You just need to focus and take care of your own games," Spiethas said.
Now each of these players has been played separately.
To the successful end, 18 gifts.
The only players who have collected more points for Spieth and Thomas over the past few days are Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwood, which is not disputed by the story of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but wonderful couple from Europe have gathered four points from four possibilities and can be quiet.
Moliwood was the only couple who needed additional blows not only on Saturday afternoons, but also on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and Friday mornings.
The course of these events and the glowing reaction of viewers only confirms that they will be the players who will win the Sunday, and no one else will be able to achieve a popularity such as Fleetwood or Molinaru, who, following the recent launch of Le Golf National, will have the chance to ensure a European victory.
It would be good to reach both at the same time in different databases.
Although it is still too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webba Simpson played short with Sergio Garcia, a four-ball hero in the morning when he was hanging with Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two double additional hits during the first nine series of gifts caused Spain and Sweden to be in trouble, from which they could not escape.
However, no one will get out of trouble on Sunday.
Four balls and four cats are so interesting to watch for the interaction between couples, for the advice they give and for which they do not give, and because the strategy can change more quickly.
Europe has played better as a team, so it has come to the end with decisive leadership, but this fourth stage has shown that the US team has a team of fighters, which some, especially in countries, have doubted.
Last day of the Ryder Cup matches Europe begins 10:6
Europe's last day of the Ryder Cup will be faced with a major change, following the fourth stage of the Saturday, leading against the United States score 10:6.
Inspiring Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinario's duet continued to change the atmosphere by winning two victories against the heavy-fighting Tiger Woods and taking the lead in the four points of Le Golf National.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, in order to preserve the trophies lost by Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the four mornings before the failed American side and ended the stage by 3:1.
The U.S. demonstrated more resistance in four boys when winning two boys, but failed to overcome points' strengths
Jimo Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12-unit match to keep the trophies in his hands.
Fleetwood is the first European novelty to win four points in a row, when Molinari and Molinari doubled Molliwood after a sensational weekend, and they are only the second couple who won four points during their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
With Woods and Patrick Reed in the quadruple, they unquestionably disturbed the confidence lost by Woods and America's newest Bryson Dechambeau with an even better result 5:4.
Woods, not so won two Saturday cats, at some moments showed a high level of professionalism, but had already lost 19 and 29 of their cats in four, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rosejas fell into four in the morning and returned to play with partner Henrik Stanson in four in the morning; they won 2+1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the first and third places in the world rankings.
Even though a pleasant, mild-winding day in the southwestern part of Paris, Europe is not all going through the butter.
Three times the winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas raised the American card, winning two points on Saturday.
Four ball cats they won an easy victory by 2:1 against John Rahm and Ian Poulter in Spain, and the fourth match won Poulter and Rory McIlroy's result 4:3 without a bullet in the first two pieces.
Only two times in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team managed to recover the four-point force from going to a single cat, although the Furyk side had lost its balance to keep the trophies.
Although two days were in the second place, on Sunday the success of them seemed to have come to an end.
North Korea says it won't be able to fight unilaterally, without being able to trust
On Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations that the continued sanctions would enhance their lack of confidence in the United States and that in such circumstances the country would certainly not unilaterally withdraw nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the World Organisation that in recent years North Korea has taken "significant good-will measures", for example, stopped nuclear missile testing, dismantled the nuclear test base, and committed to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technologies.
"But we didn't expect a similar response from the US," he lamented.
"Without any confidence in the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be the first to fight unilaterally."
Before Ri heard the complaints from North Korea about the gradual approach to nuclear disarmament that would reward North Koreans in taking action, his statement was distinguished by the fact that he completely rejected the idea of bilateral disarmament as previously done by Pchenjana.
Ri recalled the joint statement submitted by Kim Jong Unas and Donald Shortas at the first meeting of the President of the United States and North Korea Leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed to working on the "Defence of the Korean peninsula", and the Short promised to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking formal ending of the Korean war from 1950 to 1953, but the United States says that the Pchenjan must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to mitigate the severe international sanctions for North Korea.
"The US requires nuclear disarmament first and increases the pressure on sanctions in order to achieve its objective by means of coercive methods, even by rejecting the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
“To think that we can be sidetracked by sanctions is the same as to apply utopian dreams to people who don’t care.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions are improving our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second meeting of Kim and Short, which was highlighted by US leader in the United Nations so far earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings of the leader of Kim and South Korea, Moon Jae-in in the last five months: "If another country were South Korea on this nuclear disarmament issue and not the United States, the issue of semi-Saharan nuclear disarmament of Korea would not have been accepted by such an acclimat."
However, Ri's tone of speech has changed dramatically compared to last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that when Mr. Blogio's President Shortas called Kim a "mission of rockets", preparing a suicide mission, the direction of the North Korean missile to the United States was completely inevitable.
This year, in the United Nations Short, who was threatening to "completely destroy" North Korea, fought for the courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that much still needed to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea meets the nuclear disarmament requirements.
On Wednesday, Shortas said it had no time schedule for it, and said that “if necessary for two years, three years or five months, it does not matter.”
China and Russia claimed that the UN Security Council should compensate for the actions taken by the Pchenjan.
However, the Secretary of State of the United States of America, Mike`as Pomeo, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the sanctions of the Security Council must be strictly continued without any delay until a complete final demonstration of nuclear disarmament has been carried out."
The Security Council, with all its votes, endorsed the sanctions imposed by North Korea since 2006, with a view to preventing the financing of the Pchenjan nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri U.S. General Assembly in the background and later said that he would visit Pchenjane again next month to clean up the ground for another meeting.
Pompeii North Korea has already visited this year three times, but the last trip was unsuccessful.
On July he left Pchenjan, saying that all progress was just that North Korea would declare after a few hours that it had submitted "gangerous demands".
North Korea, at a meeting with Moon this month, promised to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear complex if the United States would take "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim said that the "appropriate measures" he sought are security guarantees that the short-played Singapore has and will try to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to love enough
A new course at Harvard University this year encouraged all its students to sleep more in order to fight the growing cat culture in the studios, using caffeine and not sleeping at night
One academic found that in the world’s best university students often have no basic knowledge of how to care for themselves.
Charles Čeisler, Harvard School of Medicine Professor of Sleep Medicine and Brigam Sichi, Specialist in Women's Hospitals, has prepared a course that, according to him, is the first such type of USA.
The inspiration to prepare this course visited him after talking about the impact of sleeplessness on learning.
“At the end of the talk, one girl came to me and said, ‘Why do I have to be told about this only now, in the last years of my study?’
She said that no one had told her about the importance of sleep, and it surprised me," he said "The Telegraph".
The course is offered for the first time this year. It explains to students how the most important quality sleep habits help to achieve academic and sports outcomes, improve overall self-esteem.
Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the Department of Health Services Paul Barreira said that the university decided to offer this course when it became clear that students were very sleepy during the week.
The hourly course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section has a photo of a co-room where students can click on a cup of coffee, snacks, coaches and books and thus learn about the effect of caffeine, the light effect of the lack of sleep on sports outcomes and the importance of going to sleep in the morning.
In the next section, participants learned how long-term sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the student city with interactive pictograms that encourage participants to think about their daily routine.
"We understand that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the consequences of health when you choose to smoke," explained Professor Czeisler.
The culture of hopelessness does not sleep overnight, says he still exists. Modern technologies and increasing pressure on students led to the problem of the growing lack of sleep.
"To ensure that it was sufficiently and qualitatively relaxed, students should be a secret weapon in combating stress, persecution and anxiety, he spoke, even avoiding weight gain, because the lack of sleep shifts the brain into the cooling mode, so students constantly feel hungry."
Raymond So, 19-year-old Californian, studying chemistry and physics, helped Professor Cheislerius to take a course when last year, in the first year of his life in Harvard, he attended one of his subjects.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to ask for a course available to the whole student city.
He hopes that the next step will be to invite all second-stage students to listen to this course before starting to visit this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended to students to set a timer when it is time to go to sleep, as well as driving, and to protect the harmful effects of blue light, which is spread by electronic devices and light diodes lighting, as they may lose your circular rhythm from balance, so it may be difficult to sleep.
Livingston 1:0 “Rangers”: Men’s influx killed Gerard’s men
"Rangers" experienced another disappointment when Dolly Mengai Livingstone was able to overcome the weakened result of a 1:0 by Steven Gerrard.
"Ibrox" hoped to win its first victory after the February triumph result 4:1 "St Johnstone", but Gary Holto's team won Gerrard the second time in the post of the 18th season leader, and now the last team is already eight points away from the far-off front line leaders "Hearts".
Menga entered after seven minutes before the break, but without inspiration the players “Rangers” did not see the opportunity to balance the result.
"Rangers" has now fallen to the sixth place, "Livingston" has risen to the third and is left with only one intruder.
And the concern of Rangers does not end because it is likely that a tribune butter thing has been applied to the head of the lateral judge Calumei Spencei and damaged him.
Gerrard made four changes that allowed him to embrace Air and led him to the semifinal of the Betfred cup.
On the other hand, Holt believed it was the same eleven who took the point from Hearts last week, and he would have trusted him as his well - thought-out associations brought up opponents in each step.
"Rangers" dominated control of the ball, but having it "Livingston" did more.
They were able to enter already the second minute, when Menga was hit close to handing the ball over to Scott Pittman's door, allan McGregor's head, but his safety was shattered by turning the ball away from the door.
After the far-off battle of Keaghano Jacobs, Captain Craig Halkett was hit, but his defendant, Alan Lithgowa, asked for it across the country.
"Rangers" took control, but the last third of the matches were only hopeful, not faith.
After fifteen minutes, Alfred Morelos paid me a fine when he met Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson took his hand in the Colombian complaint.
In the first dress, Rangers managed to hit only twice, but the former owner of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was ill or caused by Lassana Coulibally's blow of head or soft Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's 34-minute introduction may not match the race, no one will argue that they have already earned it for their efforts.
"Rangers" and again failed to overcome Jacobs' false defense.
Scott Arfield did not worry when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his own name and handed it over to Menga for easy completion.
During the break, Gerrard took action to change Coulibally to Ryan Kent and that change almost immediately gave fruit when the country's security defeated Morelos, but after an impressive blow after Kelly retreated he pulled the blow.
"Livingston" included guests in a game that he loved – with far-reaching Lithuanian and Halket ball transfers.
At the end of Holto’s team was able to increase their discretion, but McGregor was taken from the beating of Jacobs after the Lithuanian surrender.
After moving to the square, the player who left Rangers, Glenn Middleton, called again at the end of the match for the fine after meeting Jacobs, but Thomson and again failed him.
German: Creator of Geigeri numerator
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, today it was 136 years ago and it was born in Germany... that day future physicist Johannes Wilhelm (Hans) Geiger was born.
Geigeris has invented a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity. The invention that later created the device is known as Geigeri's computer.
Since then, this device has become the world's scientific hit, and later the popular cultural hit, when in the 1950's Bells of Coronado film, scientists who did not particularly remember Roy's Rogers and Dale's Evans:
The man: “What the hell is this? ”
Rogers: “It’s a Geigerian numerator used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you close these ears, you can actually hear how atoms work, release the radioactive effect in minerals."
Evans: "Hey, it's really shooting now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, after only a few days before the 63rd birthday.
But the invention of his name continues to live on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to develop bad cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to develop bad cells and kill them
Vaccination of the immune system to recognise bad cells – this is part of the treatment
The method includes the withdrawal of immune cells from the patient and their replacement in the laboratory
At that time, cells can "see" proteins that are typical of many forms of cancer and are re-injected back
The test vaccine has produced many promising results in the treatment of patients with various forms of cancer.
For one woman treated with this vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise bad cells, egg cancer has been reported for more than 18 months.
The method includes the withdrawal of immune cells from the patient and their replacement in the laboratory, then the cells can see proteins that are known as HER2 cancers and are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Betasda, Maryland, said: "Our results allow us to believe that we have a very promising vaccine."
“HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovaries, lungs and direct intestines”, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach when the immune cells are derived from patients and are learned to fit into cancer cells has been successfully adapted to the treatment of leukaemia.
Kanyeāas Westas launched a triad holding Short, wearing a MAGA skull, after his show SNL.
Well, that's not over.
After the presentation of the Saturday Night Live study, viewers praised Kanye West, who praised US President Donald Trump; he claimed to be in the 2020 campaign.
This evening, after performing the third song "Ghost Town", which was wearing a hat with the label "Make America Great", he continued to condemn the Democrats and expressed his support for Trump.
“How many times have I had to talk to white people, they said, ‘How can you trust Shorty, because he’s a racist?’
Well, if racism were to bother me, I'd be out of America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL show began with a comical scene where Matt Damon came out of Bretto Kavanaugh’s certificate to the Senate’s court committee on the charges of improper sexual behaviour presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although this was not broadcast, the filmed material with West Replica into social networks was introduced by comics Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to trust this record from West.
In addition, Westas complained to the audience that in the back of his head, he had disabilities.
"They were looking at me in the backyard.
He said don't go there with that hat.
They've been pretending to be me!
They said I reached the bottom," he cried "Washington Examiner".
Wests continued: “Do you want to see what the ass is? ” He asked. ◆ The crown of his superman, which means that you cannot tell me what to do. Do you want the world to live?
Start to love."
His statements resulted at least twice in the non-conformity audit, and SNL broadcasters appeared to be shocked, as Variity reports. One man asked the media: “The entire study has brought about a deadly silence.”
West was invited to quickly replace the singer Ariana Grande because her ex-boyfriend Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West was a great fan of his appearance, through which he performed the song "I Love it", wearing the Perrier bottle suit.
He received support from the conservative leader Candace Turner of the TPUSA group, who announced in the Twitter account: “One of the bravest spirits for the human being: ACHIU FOR PREVIOUS MINIALS.”
But the conversational tape leader Karen Hunter on Twitter published a record that West was just "self-contained and that is unusually wonderful".
"But I choose the NEREMTI person (by buying his music or clothing, or by supporting his "art") whose convictions are a sad ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
But we are also free," she added.
Prior to the start of the show, the poet in the Twitter account announced that he changed his name and that he is now formally known as Kanye West.
He's not the first creator to change his name, but he was on the same path as did Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Collegiate rappers Snoop Dogges originally called Snoop Lions; the music legend Prince has changed his name to a symbol and later became known as Prince.

The Star of System Wars Another Harington criticises a distorted view of manhood
Another Harington was the character of John Snau HBO in a fantastic series of adventures about the Middle Ages of the World Wars.
But the 31-year-old actor criticises the macho's great-grandfather's stereotype. He says that such roles on the screen often make young boys feel as if they should be tough to be respected.
Speaking on Sunday Times Culture, Another said that he thought "something is wrong", and raised the question of how to fight the problem of distorted manhood in #MeToo era.
Another, who recently led a 31 - year - old colleague named Rose Leslie, who was a star of the “Societal Wars, ” admitted that he was“ deeply hurt. ”
"I feel that I now feel strongly about this subject. Where did we make a mistake in forming a manhood?" he asked.
"What do we teach grown men to face such problems?"
Another believes that the wave of this distorted manhood could be partly responsible for television, as it creates very male characters.
He continued: “Who is born again, and what is taught?
What is taught on television or on the street, so that young people are convinced that they need to have such a manhood?
I think this is one of the important issues of our time: how can we change it?
Clearly, young men and I have made a mistake somewhere."
He also confirmed in the interview that he would not participate in any of the "Societal Wars" opponents or continues when the next summer's show ended, and said that "he already had enough fighting fields and horses".
As of November, the next film in the modern version of Samo Shepardo True West. It's a film about filmmakers and his brother's movie.
The actor recently revealed the best thing that happened to him when he was building the War of the System – there he met his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife in this series, so in this sense the series gave me a future family and a future life," he said.
The "Emmy" award in the fantastic series Rose played Igrit, another character of John Snow's love object.
The couple married Leslie in June 2018 in the property of the family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases of disease
China reports that the infection of HIV-infected citizens and AIDS increased by 14 %.
According to health authorities, more than 820,000 people were infected in the country.
A second quarter of 2018 reported about 40,000 new cases.
Most newly infected people were sexually transmitted, which differs from previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV infection in some parts of China is rapidly spreading due to infections in the blood.
But this reduced the number of people infected with HIV by almost zero, indicating the representatives of the Chinese health authorities during the conference in the province of Junan.
Over time, however, HIV infection and the number of people living with AIDS increased to 100,000 in China.
The transmission of HIV by sex is a major issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China has been decriminalized in 1997, but the discrimination of LGBT persons has spread.
As conservative values prevail in the country, 70 to 90 % of men who have sexual relations with men are ultimately married to women.
The majority of cases of infection are due to inadequate protection measures in such sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised global access to HIV medicines as one of the ways to tackle this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the workers have collected data from the Republican Senator, condemning "dangerous lie" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, the United States Representative Maxine Waters denied the suspicion that one of her employees had published personal information from three US senators on Wikipedia's pages of lawmakers.
Los Angeles Democrat believed that the charges were filed by ultra-right wing experts and websites.
"Mela, molasses and again nomadic molasses," said Waters on his Twitter account.
It is reported that there were also the addresses and telephone numbers of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike's Lee and Orrin Hatcho, both from Juts.
Information on the Internet appeared Thursday, it was published by an unknown person from the Capitol Valley at the time of the Senate's allegations of improper sexual conduct against the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanauhui.
The missing information appeared as soon as these three senators asked Kavanauhu questions.
“Conservatories’ websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, have been informed that the IP address, which identified the source of these records relating to the Waters office, has been disclosed to the Waters staff member’s information”, is reported from the Capitol.
"These baseless suspicions are completely false and absolute melas," continued Waters.
‘My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security have been affected by these misleading and uncertain suspicions, is in no way responsible for the destruction of this information.
These baseless suspicions are completely false and absolute lies."
Waters' statement quickly called for criticism on the Internet, as well as from the press of the former representative of the White House, Ari Flescheri.
"This denial sounds bad," Flescheris wrote.
"It says that it does not have enough self-reliance to be a Congressman.
If someone is accused of things that he has not done, he should not be angry.
He shouldn't argue.
He should not doubt the accused’s motives.
It should be quiet and humble."
It seems that Fleischeris tried to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats by Judge Kavanaughi, who was accused of being too evil at the Thursday session.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who participated in the mid-term election campaign to change Waters, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Truth, if not a lie," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters stated that its office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these false accusations.
"We will ensure that the organizers will explain, 'She continued, 'that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees, without exception.'
A review of the comedy "John English Again Smurf" – a spooked show with Rowan Atkinson
The tradition has already become the focus of Brexit in any British film. The same can be said of the restoration of the "John English" "John English" comedy of action comedy – it was started to show in 2003, and in 2011 it returned to the screens with the "John English Rise".
Will this sarcastic self-satisfaction about how we have clearly assumed become a new option for national exports?
Whatever the case, the incompetent John English with wide eyes and rubber face has the second opportunity to bring into the surface irreconcilable truths, since the very name clearly indicates that this comedy is not intended for the English-speaking cinematograph regions.
Of course, this vicious secret agent, who, although he has a claim to prosperity, acquired and acquired a little of the characteristics of Inspector Clouseau, a little of Mr. Byno's characteristics and background similarity to that man, suggests that the theme of the drama "Fire Transport" was used during the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
He is also a somewhat well-founded person about a traveler and a secret man who caused the chaos that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial.
In this latest John English film, there are a few beautiful moments.
I liked it when Johnny English was approaching the gunman, wearing a middle - aged suit and scarf, and the art rotor fell into his cold.
The comedy Atkinson's talent is obvious, but the same humour seems to be inflated and strangely exaggerated, especially when serious film brands, such as 007 and "Mission impossible", bravely inserts the comedy elements.
Humor is as much for children as for adults, and I don't believe the adventures of Johnny English don't seem as inventive and as quiet as Atkinson's silent jokes when playing Mr. Byne.
At present, the most common issue is that Britain was in serious trouble.
The cybernetic hacker successfully hacked into Britain's highly secret web of soap and revealed the identities of all of this area of Britain's soap, causing the agent's insult, which is too insignificant for Kevin Eldon's role.
This is the last drop in the Prime Minister's cup of pampastic and in the corner of a person who is already suffering from the shocking political unpopularity: Emma Thompson of Teresa May prints everything he can, but in the scenario, good material is little.
Wise advisers inform her that the identity of all her agents has been revealed and that she will have to look for people among those who have retired.
This means that you're going to have to go to John English, who is currently working at a school director in some research institution, but who provides illegal lessons like working as a secret agent. Here were some good jokes when England offered a School of Rock snooping academy.
England is sent back to Vithola to discuss the unusual situation and there it agrees for a long time to its common Bough, again known as Ben Miller.
Bough is already married to the captain of the submarine, and Vicki Pepperdine, a high-level girl, seems to be underexploited.
Thus, Batman and Robin, who are able to interfere with all matters in the Most High’s secret service, again take action and meet with Olga Curylenko, a fatal beauty of Ophelija Bouletova.
A charismatic billionaire is dangerous to the Prime Minister, claiming that he can solve the problem of British computers, i.e. the evil Jason Volt, who is named Jake Lacy.
England and Bough start their watch: when the players are ready, they make a fire in the French restaurant, cause chaos in the delicious Volta yacht, and England starts a complete anarchy, trying to use virtual reality ears to meet Volta's interior.
All the stops were clear to keep this latest series, but whatever it is pleasant or wild, all this reminds children of the TV.
It's kind of mean.
As with other films, I couldn't get rid of my mind: the UK film industry cannot give Rowan an Atkinson a role that would really be worth his talent?
The Liberal Party rejects a plan for British workers for four days a week, but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Leiborist Party plans to consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work for four days a week, but to pay a fee for five days.
It is reported that the party wants the company’s leaders to share in savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution (DI) by giving their employees one day off.
This would allow workers to enjoy a three-day weekend and at the same time to pay the same amount at home.
The source says that this is in line with the Party's economic agenda and plans to channel the development of the country to workers in a positive direction.
The transition to four working days was also welcomed by the Conference of the Professional Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the benefits of the changing economy.
One of the high-ranking Lebanese party's sources, The Sunday Times, said: "The review of the political provisions is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but for four working days, the party's approach to economic balancing for the benefit of employees, as well as the overall strategy of the party's industry, will be consistent with the party's approach."
The Liberals' Party was not the first to promote this idea; the Green Party also won a four-day campaign during 2017.
However, this thought is currently not supported by the entire Lebanese party.
The representative of the Liberal Party said: "The weekend of working days is not a party's policy and it is not considered in the party."
The shadow government representative, John McDonnelllis, took advantage of the opportunity to present his vision of the socialist revolution economy at the Liborist Party conference last week.
Mr McDonnell said he was willing to withdraw the power from the "freedom dictators" and the "profit hunters" municipal services companies.
Such shadow Chancellor plans also mean that current water company shareholders may not recover all of their share because, in view of the flight made, the Lebanese government can read something.
It also approved plans to include employees in the company board and to create own funds to transfer the capital of 10 per cent of private sector enterprises to employees and could receive up to GBP 500 annual dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answered the question "60 Minutes" whether an FTB study on B. Kavanaugh could change their opinion
At least one final vote was postponed for a week during the FTB's investigation of the charges brought to Judge Brett Kavanauhui, and the question arises as to whether the facts to be clarified by the Bureau of Investigation could affect the views of any Republican senators in such a way as to prevent them from accepting this judge.
In an interview on Sunday evening, the 60-minutes correspondent, Scott Pelley, asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether it could happen that the FTB would find out something that would change their opinion.
You see, Senator J. Kennedy has a more liberal attitude than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Well, yes, of course," replied J. Kennedy.
“As I said at the meeting, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
When the charges came up, I called him and asked, “Did you do that? ”
He answered with a firm, firm, unmistakable response."
Therefore, Mr Graham's opinion would not change anything.
"I have decided on Bretto Kavanaugh, and there should be serious accusations," he says.
"Because of Dr. Ford – I don't know what was there, but I know one thing: Bretta is categorically negative," added Mr. Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“No one named it can confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anyone's going to find out."
What is the World Citizens' Festival, and how has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday in New York will be a World Citizens Festival – an annual music event that shows an impressive number of stars and aims at at at least the most impressive goal – to eliminate poverty in the world.
For the past seven years, the World Citizens' Festival of the Central Park will be attended by tens of thousands of people who will not only listen to the stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawnas Mendess, but will also learn more about the real purpose of the event – to eliminate the extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival was launched in 2012. It will continue the World Fight against Poverty project – an international mediation group that intends to eliminate poverty by actively increasing the number of people fighting it.
In order to obtain a free ticket to the event (unless you wanted to buy a paid VIP ticket), concert visitors had to perform various tasks or actions, such as engaging in volunteer activities, sending an e-mail to the world leader, calling the phone or otherwise helping to raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
However, do the citizens of the world succeed in achieving this goal?
Is the idea to reward people for a free concert really will convince them to demand and encourage them to act? Maybe it's just another example of so-called clickivism, fictional activism, people think that they will really change the situation by signing an online petition or posting an entry on the Twitter network.
According to World Citizens' Festival organizers, since 2011, more than 19 million of their supporters have registered their actions to promote a wide range of objectives.
They say that, under pressure, the world leaders have announced 37 billion US dollars worth of commitments and policy strategies that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group indicated 390 commitments and statements which the Group's actions have already paid or collected at least 10 billion US dollars.
With the group's funding, almost 649 million people around the world are already directly affected.
Among some key commitments can be mentioned "The Power of Nutrition" – a partnership between investors and operators operating in the United Kingdom to "help children to grow up and discover their full potential". Having heard more than 4,700 news from the World's Twitter citizens, she promised to give Rwanda US dollars to help solve the food shortage in the country.
"With the support of the United Kingdom governments, sponsors, governments of countries and such as you, the citizens of the world, we can achieve that social injustices such as food shortages will become the past," said Ambassador Tracey Ullman to the concert held in London in April 2018.
This group also indicated that after receiving 5,000 requests for improved nutrition in the United Kingdom, the government announced funding for the Mitybo power project, which will reach 5 million women and children.
In reply to one of the DUK’s questions on “Why do you think we can eliminate a particularly high poverty?”,
The world’s citizens respond: “That is a long and difficult path — sometimes in trouble and failure.
However, like the great movements of human rights and against apartheid, we will win because we are all stronger together."
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawnas Mendess, Cardi B, Janelle Monae is a few of the performers participating in this year's New York event. The event is all Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
According to the Secretary of Home Affairs, the US can use the fleet to block Russian energy exports
"If necessary, Washington may use the ship to hinder Russia's energy from reaching markets, as well as the Middle East markets," says US Secretary of Home Affairs Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner says.
Mr Zinke claims that Russia's participation in Syria, in particular when it acts in a legitimate invitation to a government, is a pretext for research into new energy markets.
"I think that Russia is moving towards the Middle East because it wants to regulate the energy sector, as it does in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," said Zinke.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to address this issue.
"The United States can do so by means of a vessel, can ensure that the seas are open and, if necessary, can run the blockade, can ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
R. Zinke said this to the participants in the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance – not the profit group, which was renamed the US "Energy Consumers' Voice".
He went on to compare Washington's methods with those of Russia and Iran, and noted that they were essentially equal.
"The economic alternative for Iran and Russia is to find a greater or lesser balance that would change the fuel," he also spoke of Russia as a country whose entire economy depends only on fossil fuels.
These statements have appeared to the short-term administration in the mission to increase their liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and to replace Russia on the market, which offers European consumers a much cheaper opportunity.
Therefore, the officials of the short administration, including US President Donald Short, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the wrong North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Mr. Trump, Berlin became free of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the 11 billion North Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity up to 110 billion cubic metres, is only an economic project.
According to Kremlin, the reason for Washington’s opposition to this project is purely economic, which is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all agree that energy cannot be a pressure instrument and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novaks spoke after a meeting with US Secretary of Energy Ricku Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position called for an adverse German reaction, and it reiterated its willingness to continue this project.
The main organisation of the German industry, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), urged the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I do not really support third-country interference in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), following the recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massacuse says that he is serious about raising his candidacy during the 2020 presidential election
On Saturday, Senator of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, seriously discussing the question of presidential candidacy after the mid-term elections.
During the meeting at the Holocaust in Massachusetts, E. Warren confirmed the opportunity for candidates to be considered.
"The goal of women to go to Washington to manage our corrupt governments, they must also go to the highest level," she said in her essay.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider whether to participate in the presidential elections."
At a meeting in the town hall, E. Warren welcomed President Donald Trump, saying he led the country in an inappropriate direction.
"I am very afraid of how Donald Shortas treats our democracy," she said.
E. Warren openly criticises D. Trump and his proposed candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, in a Twitter message, Mr Warren said that "the FTB investigation must be carried out until the vote is no doubt necessary".
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that the majority of voters in the country themselves believe that it should not apply to the presidents in 2020.
According to a survey conducted by the political research centre of Safolko University and Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the voters of Massachusetts are expected to say that the senator should not participate in the elections.
Thirty-two percent support her candidacy.
The survey showed that more support was expected by former Governor Devals Patrick – 38 percent supported his candidacy and 48 percent opposed him.
The next debate on the possible nomination in 2020 is the name of the party's representatives of the emerging Democratic Party, former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Mr Biden says that the official decision will be taken in January, as the Associated Press reports.
At the Donald Trump Summit, Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic disorder of Track Palino
At 26 years of age, Track Palin, who took up military service in September, spent a year in Iraq.
On Monday night, after an incident of violence in the family, he was arrested and accused.
"I have seen what my son is going through when he comes back to the day-to-day life, so I can understand the other families who feel the effects of post-traumatic disorder, and some of the injuries of our soldiers they are returning with," she spoke to those gathered at the Donald Trump conference in Tals, Oklahoma.
S. Palin called his arrest a avoidable truth. She said that the sons and other war veterans “returned a little bit, they returned with a stronger heart, they returned with doubts, whether they would gain respect for what their fellow soldiers and lacquer, and all the other soldiers have surrendered to their country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Vasilo, Alaska, and was charged with violence in the family and assault against women, as well as with charges preventing him from reporting violence in the family with a gun and being blind, as Dan Bennett reported, a representative of the Vasila Police Department for the press.
The 18 states and the Colombian District supports the opposition to the new asylum policy of asylum seekers
Eighteen states and the Colombian district support the legal challenge of the new US policy, which refuses to grant asylum to victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, 18 countries and representatives of this district submitted friendly comments to Curiae (Journal Counsellor) to support the defence of asylum seekers' policy, NBC News reports.
The entire applicant's name in the Grace v. Sessions process, which the American Civil Liberties Union has launched against federal policy, is undisclosured.
She says her partner "and his criminal gang members" raped her, but on July 20th, the US officials rejected her request for asylum.
She was detained by Texas.
The judges of the states that supported Grace described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which the United States receives many asylum requests, such as states, caused the problems of permanent gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has repealed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Council, which allowed non-documented immigrants fleeing the family of violence to seek asylum.
On Friday, the Colombian District Attorney General, Karl Racineas, stated that the new policy "is not subject to the laws of the states, federal and international that are in force for decades".
"Federal laws require decisions on asylum applications to be taken in the light of the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and in such an insurance, this principle is violated," said friends in the Curiae note.
In this remark, lawyers also claim that the policy of preventing immigrants from entering the country is detrimental to the US economy, and more likely for immigrants to engage in business and "provide the necessary work services".
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessionas pointed out in June that immigration issues were no longer addressed to asylum-seekers in the family and to victims of gang violence.
"The asylum is granted to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nation or belonging to a certain social group or political views," said J. Sessionas in a statement on the 11th day of June.
A asylum has never been designed to solve all the problems (not all the serious problems) people face every day around the world.
Twice after the number of victims has risen, the rest of the living are desperately sought
The situation of the remaining living is constantly deteriorating.
"A very big attack," says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, recalling her baby's son being slaughtered in the city's escape centre.
“The mobiles do not continue to carry more and more bodies.
There's no clean water."
It has been observed that the residents return to their damaged homes, pick up heavy items in the water, try to save as soon as they can.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and 7.5 bullet-throwing hospitals have been decomposed.
Some injured patients, like Dwi Haris, who have experienced back and shoulder fractures, have been hospitalized in the field near the Pale army, which continues to be treated in the field for severe repeated injuries.
His eyes were filled with tears as he spoke of the earthquake in the high room of the hotel five in which he stood with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save others.
I am shown that I broke through the walls of the wall," said Dr. Harris "Associated Press" and added that he and his family came to the city to participate in weddings.
“I heard a voice of my wife’s help, and then I kept silent.
I don't know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope they're healthy."
U.S. Ambassador Liquor accuses China of promoting advertising
A week ago, when the official Chinese newspaper distributed four pages of advertisements in the U.S. daily, with the mutual benefit of trade between the U.S. and China, the US ambassador accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Short last Wednesday referred to the annex of the most expensive newspaper in the state of Iowa, "Des Moines Register", and accused China of affecting the U.S. Congress elections on 6 November. China rejects such a charge.
"D. Short charge that Beijing tries to influence the US elections, marks a new strengthening phase of Washington's campaign aimed at putting pressure on China," the US officials told the Reuters agency.
While it is common for foreign governments to distribute advertising in order to encourage trade, Beijing and Washington are currently entrapped into a growing trade war, and both countries are collecting tariffs for imports of each other.
According to Chinese and US experts, the Chinese responsible tariffs were applied to the exporters of Iowa and similar countries who supported the short-term Republican Party.
Terry Branstadas, the US Ambassador to China, the former long-term governor of Iowa and one of the major agricultural exporters to China, said that Beijing had suffered harm to American workers, farmers and business.
On Sunday, in an opinion published in the newspaper Des Moines Register, T. Branstadas stated that China "is more concerned with printing propaganda in the free press."
"In spreading the propaganda, the Chinese government used the respected freedom of speech and press in America and ordered a paid advertising report "Des Moines Register," T. Branstadas wrote.
"At the same time, you will not find each other's opposing voices in the local press in Beijing and you will not have a real video that reflects the different opinions that Chinese people may have about China's worrying economic trajectory, because the press is behind a hard pressure from the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
T. Branstada also added that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers had left the press" article, but did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analytical warning: In the nearness of mid-elections, B. Kavanaugh has rejected the Republican voter
Although many Republican leaders remain loyal to the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, to whom even several charges of sexual harassment have been made, analysts warned that this would be a negative response during the forthcoming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The emotions of the situation are very strong, and many Republicans are already officially claiming to vote.
It is not possible to withdraw such things later," said Professor Grant Reeheris of the University of Syracuse University of Maksvel School on Saturday of The Hill.
Mr Reeheris argued that the last-minute invitation of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to launch the FTB investigation would be sufficient to discourage the wrong voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will remember it both tomorrow and November," according to the Washington newspaper, on Friday, the Senior Adviser of the MovementOn Group and the National Representative Karine Jean-Pierre said.
On Friday morning, the protestors sang: "Lapcris is approaching!" during the demonstration, the Senate Foy, when the Republicans in charge of the Judicial Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite the evidence of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, kzip reported "Mic".
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will strike through the borders," said a political analyst Stu Rothenberg to the news site.
People say it was already strong, and they're right.
But it could still strengthen the positions, especially between undecided female voters in the suburbs and young voters from 18 to 29 years of age who, although not in favour of the President, often simply do not vote."
Even before Mr Ford publicly giving evidence, when she made detailed allegations of sexual harassment against the candidate in the Supreme Court, the analysts argued that if the Republicans approve the candidacy, this could lead to insulting.
"Republican parties have made this a big impression," said former president of the National Committee of Republicans Michael Steele last week, according to NBC News.
"Talk not only about the committee's or final vote, not only about whether Kavanaugh will be appointed a lawyer, but also about how the Republicans managed this situation and how he dealt with Ch. B. Ford," said Guy's news channel, "The United States of Priority" - the director of the group assisting democratic elections.
However, it seems that the Americans do not yet agree on what to expect from the evidence of Mr Kavanaugh and Mr Ford, although she is waiting for a little more support.
The new survey “YouGov” shows that 41 percent of respondents are fully or possibly trusted in evidence by Ch. B. Ford, while 35 percent are fully or most likely to believe in B. Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent claimed that B. Kavanaugh really or probably lied in giving evidence, and only 30 percent felt the same about Ch. B. Ford.
Called J. Flake’s, FTB is currently investigating the allegations made by Ch. B. Ford and at least one of the other defendants, Deborah Ramirez, said, “The Guardian”.
Mr Ford, after his oath, gave evidence to the Senate Judicial Committee last week, claiming that Mr Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Mr Ramirez argues that the candidate to the Supreme Court showed her his genitals in the evening they attended at the University of Jelio at the 9th.
Web designer plans to create a new internet to oppose Google and Facebook
World Network Designer Tim Berners-Lee is creating a new start to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary inventor "Inrupt" is a company whose work is based on the open code platform "Solid".
The Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as who and to which information is available.
In an exceptional interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the Inrupt goal was to manage the world.
“We have to do this now,” he said about the start.
- It's a historic moment."
The program that operates on the basis of Solid technology allows people to create their own online personal data store – POD.
It may include lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal or work tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would be available in one browser at the same time.
The internet store of personal data is unique in that only the user decides which and which information can be accessed.
The company calls this a person's mandate through the data.
According to Director-General John Bruce of the company, the concept of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and the necessary skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of T. Berners-Lee, J. Bruce’s, IBM purchased a security platform, several programmers appointed to work with this project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, global technology developers can create their own decentralised software using the tools provided on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not agree with Facebook or Google about the changes that would turn up all the business models at night.
"We do not ask for their permission."
On Saturday, in the Medium report, Berners-Lee writes that "Inrupt" "is a mission to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the sustainability and quality of a new Solid-based network."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet into a Consortium of Knowledge at the University of Massachusetts Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential opinion in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even working with Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Knowledge Consortium, the Knowledge Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I feel a great optimism about this new era of the internet," said Berners-Lee.
Honored Bernard Vannas — A Blessed Priest in the First World War of the Victorian Cross
For the 100th anniversary of his birth in the city, the only Anglican priest, who was awarded the Victorian Cross as a fighter during World War I.
Lieutenant pastor Bernard Vannas won the award on 29 September 1918 during the Belenglizo and Lucuria attack.
Unfortunately, after four days the pastor was kidnapped by the sniper, so he remained unaware that he had been awarded the highest award to the British army.
During the parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, the stone of memory was uncovered by two rings.
Michael Vannas, one of the pollsters, said that the stone was decomposed at 100 years ago from the age of winning fireworks is “excellently symbolic”.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the lieutenant led his battalion through the Old Kent canal "twenty-two highly-explored smoke, with a heavy load of state and automatic fires."
He then rushed to the line of assault and "especially gallantically" led the line before, and then one attacked the situation and defeated three battlers.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was killed by the German sniper on 4 October 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
At 72 years of age, Michael Vanna said that his older brother’s actions were “something that would never be equal to anyone, but at the same time a very inspiring thing.”
After the parade led by the imperial youth orchestra in Brentwood, Michael and his brother, Dr. James Vanna, helped the victory.
Michael Vannas said that he had great honor for participating in the parade and added: “A true member of the court shows the support that will be given to a multitude of people. ”
MMA astronauts didn't sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but had to be satisfied with "Kyulyte Pepa"
Imagine: You're not going to sleep all night to see the so-called Bellator 206, but you're finally unable to see the main vision.
There were 13 wars in San Choze's office, of which six are on the main card and broadcast directly in the United Kingdom all night through Channel 5.
6 hours in the morning, Gedard Moussai and Rory MacDonald, when preparing for the fight, the UK watched the film "Kiālytė Pepa" that stopped broadcasting.
Some observers were not impressed when they said mildly, for it was because of this fight until the day.
In the tweet, one patient called the change in the transmission to a children's animated film "some liquefied peach."
“In accordance with the rules laid down by the authorities, such content is not appropriate at 6 o'clock in the morning, so it was necessary to set up a programme for children,” the chief marketing and communication vice president Dave’s Schwartz replied about the broadcast.
"Yes, little Pepa."
President Scott Cokeri of Bellator said that in the future, efforts will be made to adjust the timetables in view of the observers in the United Kingdom.
"When I think about the repetition, it seems to me that we might be able to do it," Coker said.
"But there are then 6 hours in the morning, Sunday, and we would not be able to resolve it until Sunday, during Monday's time.
However, we are already working on this.
Trust that after a change in the transmission, you have exchanged a number of messages that were not all friendly.
We tried to fix the situation, we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it's a matter of government.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the number of fights up to five instead of six – as we usually do. We wanted to give the astronauts more, but it just didn't work.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Thomas Daley felt unworthy of his sexual orientation
The Olympic swimmer in the water, Tom Daley, says that he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
24 sportsman only said that he was not the same as everyone at the primary school.
For the first time, Lauren Laverne, in the play “Desert Island Discs” on Radio 4 he claimed to speak publicly about the rights of geese because he wants to give hope to others.
He also said that it was not so important to win the Olympics after becoming a father.
For several months, Kirsty Young, the permanent leader of this long-standing marriage, retired from work because of the disease.
In L. Laverne's first play, which guests are asked to imagine is going to an uninhabited island, T. Daley said as he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because he was socially unacceptable to both boys and girls.
He said: “Even these days, the feeling of poverty and cynicism has been a source of strength that has helped me to succeed. ”
He claimed that he wanted to prove the existence of this value in order not to disappoint the circumstances when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
The winner of the two Olympic Bronze Medals became a high-level LGBT activist and, in this year's participation in the games of the British Society, took the opportunity to invite more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he had talked about it to the public, for he believed that he had succeeded in being able to live openly without any consequences, so he would like to give that hope to others.
The world champion three times said that he was not expected to imitate the man – the filmmaker Dustin Lance in the United States, with whom he met in 2013.
Mr. Daley married 20-year-old Oscar Laureate last year, but he says that the age difference has never caused problems.
According to T. Delay, when he was so young as to survive in his first Olympics he attended only 14 and after three years of cancer his father died, – it's hard to see anything that would be the same age, but experienced the same height and ground .
In June, the couple became the parents of Robert Ray Blacko-Daley's son, the perspective of T. Daley, according to him, changed completely.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have said that it is important for me to win the gold medal," he said.
– But, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robis is my Olympic gold medal."
The son's name was the same as that of Uncle Robert, who died of brain cancer in the '40s in 2011.
Anto T. Daley, father didn't want to deal with death, so one of his last questions was whether to buy tickets to the 2012 London Olympics that he was going to watch in the first row.
"I could not tell him that he would no longer live so long as he could sit in the first row," said Mr Daley.
– I held back the hand when he stopped breathing, and only then did I finally admit that he was not harmless,” said Mr. Daley.
After years, the athlete competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and claimed bronze.
"I just knew that I had dreamed about it all my life – jumping into the water to watch local spectators in the Olympic Games – there is no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the first song selection for the song – Heather Small, the song "Proud", which responded to his feelings as he prepared the Olympics and still pleasantly sprayed the skin.
"Desert Island Discs" is broadcast on Saturday at 11.15 a.m. during the summer of Britain.
After losing the shape, Ph. Mickelson passed the Ryder Cup tournament on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will score the record on Sunday, because he will be participating 47 times in the Ryder Cup tournament, but in order not to succeed in the wedding, he will need a great improvement in the form.
Ph. Mickelson, already playing for the 12th time every two years in a race, was placed on the throne by Captain Jim Furyk.
Instead of being at the former centre of action, as often was in the United States, five times the main winner spent part of the day on the maintenance team, and the rest improved his technique on the platform in order to correct obstacles to play.
Even in a career that has not been very direct, 48 athletes are not the ideal player in Le Gold National squares, whose long rounds of hot grass are extremely unpleasant for unsightly hits.
In addition, as the site itself would not be quite scary, on the ninth match, which will take place on Sunday, Ph. Mickelson is playing against the top goals of the British Open Tournament Championship Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches this week along with the new guy Tommy Fleetwood.
If a four-point American can get a good start on the approaching 12-unit match, Ph. Mickelson's mother can be absolutely determined.
Furyak expressed confidence in his player, but he probably couldn't speak differently.
"He perfectly understood the role he played today, pushed me through my back and wrapped his hand and told me that he was ready to play even tomorrow," Furykas said.
- He doesn't lack confidence in himself.
He is on the list of the most famous athletes both in the past and this week has given a lot to these teams.
Maybe I didn't think he was playing two cats.
I figured more, but that's the way it went, so we decided we'd do it.
He wants to play like everyone."
On Sunday, Ph. Mickelson will improve Nick Faldo's record and become the main player in the Ryder Cup Cup.
It may be that this will mark the end of his Ryder cup career, not equal to the heights of his personal records.
Ph. Mickelson belongs to 18 winners, 20 losses and seven levels, but Furykas claims that his presence brought no material benefits to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, conscious, he likes to laugh at people and he's a great man with whom he's happy to be in the team room," he explained.
– I think that younger players this week were also hard to deal with, it was good to look at.
It brings much more than the game."
European Captain Thomas Bjornas knows that a great deal of change can quickly come to light
Thomas Bjornas, the European team's captain, knows from experience that a great deal of caution in approaching the recent competitions of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult fight.
The Danish sportsman debuted in 1997 in Valderamo, where Captain Seve’s Ballesteroso’s team of opponents held a five-point lead against the Americans, but the finish line was drawn just as early as the result of 141:13 1⁄2.
"We remember now that we had a great deal of change in Valderamo; we had a great change in Brooklyn where we lost, and also in Valderamo where we won, but just enough," said T. Bjorn (photo), watching the 2018 victory at 5:3 Friday and 10:6 at Le Golf National Square.
Then the story will show me and all the team members that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow will require all the power.
Go and do everything right.
Until there are no points in the board, the game is not over.
We have the goal of trying to win this prize, so we must pursue it consistently.
I always said, I trust those 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well who is on the other side – the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the appearance of his players on a complex site, T. Bjørnas added: “I would not like to escape in any way.
Tomorrow's gonna be a whole different hair thing.
Tomorrow will be the most important individual game – everything else.
It's great to play with your partner when it's all right, but when you're on the platform alone, trying your ability to play golf limits.
This idea needs to be introduced to players – tomorrow you will have to push everything out of your mind.
Now you're gonna have to separate with your partner, and he's gonna have to print everything out."
Unlike T. Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk hopes that his players will appear better individually than partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who gathered three points in four.
Furyak himself experienced both sides of the last day's surprises because he was on the winning team in Brooklyn until Europe came to the miracle of Medina and didn't value their losers."
“I remember every damn word,” he answered, asked as Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 to motivate his players to prepare for the last day.
– Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but get a quick start – as you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When a speed occurs in one direction, the middle cats become very tense.
We formed our team accordingly and released the players in a way that we, you know... we're trying to create some magic tomorrow."
Mr Thomas will be tasked with trying to drive a responsible fight and meet with Rory McIlroy's top-level match, and among the Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jonas Rahmas, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
"I have selected these men in this order, because I think they will successfully win the whole game," said T. Bjornas about his choice for unit meetings.
The presentation of the new German military ship is postponed again
The latest German military fleet fleet had to start working in 2014 and replace cold wartime military ships, but according to the local press, they will not be seen at least until next year because of the growing systems and the high prices.
According to a military representative quoted by Die Zeit, Rheinland-Pfalz, the main new Badeno-Viurtemberg fleet, the delay in operation has now been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was to join the military fleet in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project has been hampered by the problems that the ship has already faced.
Four Badeno-Viurtemberg class ships, which the military ship ordered in 2007, will replace the Bremen class’s sensitive frugals.
They are expected to have a powerful attitude, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-shipcraft rockets and certain secrecy technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic footprints.
Another important feature is longer surveillance intervals, which would allow the latest fregats to sail far from home ports for up to two years.
However, according to Die Zeit, due to the unending delays, military vessels of the most advanced technology, which are said to have allowed Germany to direct military power into the overseas territories, are old before they are used.
The F125 failed last year when the German military ship officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This is the first time a military ship returns the ship already delivered to the builder.
The reason for the return is not known, but the German press has minimized a number of major software and technical equipment defects that would have caused the ship to have nothing to believe in in the military mission.
The lack of software is very important, as the Badeno-Viurtemberg class will manage about 120 marine crews – through smaller forces than in the older Bramen class frigates.
In addition, it has been shown that this ship is extremely difficult – it reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the military fleet to introduce various improvements in the future.
It is believed that 7 000 tonnes of Rheinland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as the similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
The cost of the whole project, including the training of the crew, is also gradually becoming a problem.
It is said that it rose from the initial EUR 2.2 billion to the crushing EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The latest frugal problems have become very significant after recent warnings that the German military fleet is losing its power.
Earlier this year, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, Hans-Peter Bartels, admitted that the military ship is in fact "missing the proper use of ships".
The officer said that some time had passed since the old ships had already been registered, but he did not find out how to change them.
He regretted that none of the Badeno-Viurtemberg class frigates could join the military fleet.
"National Trust" listens to the life of a secret coward
A new study, conducted in one of Scotland’s two altitudes, is aimed at revealing how bats use land-based hunting.
The findings are expected to provide new knowledge of the behaviour of unique flying mammals and to provide some guidance for future nature conservation activities.
Scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will be monitoring the spooky bats, soprano bats, red eagles and water-dried bats in the Vester Roso Inverevo gardens in their research.
Special recorders will be issued at certain sites of the territory allowing for the tracking of skimmed-stock activities throughout the season.
National Health Service staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile research by hand detectors.
An analysis of all audio recordings shall be carried out by the experts to determine the frequency and activity of any type of radiological signals.
Then a map and a report of living areas will be created to help form a detailed picture of behaviour across the landscape.
“National Trust for Scotland” (NTS) natural protection adviser Rob Dewars hopes that the results will reveal what the living areas are most important to the poor and how they use each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of residential area surveillance, such as the creation of caves, as well as how to best manage forest areas so that they are suitable for smallpox and other related species.
In the last century, the Scythian population in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has collapsed.
They are threatened by construction and real estate development, affecting the periphery and the destruction of residential areas.
There are also threats to wind power and lightnings, as well as mosquitoes, some chemical tools used to treat building materials, as well as hunting pets.
The scoundrels aren't really blind.
However, catching a grave during the nightly hunting helps more ears than eyes.
The exact location of the obstacles in the track of the wagon or flight shall be precisely determined by means of an artificial echolocation.
NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is particularly responsible for fraud.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out investigations, check the gaps and sometimes rescue operations .
The organization has even created the first and only reserve dedicated specifically to schizophrenia in Scotland in Damfrise and the Thrave in Galvia, where eight of the ten Scottish schizophrenia species live.
David Thompson, the overseer of the court, says that the territory of the court is ideal for them.
"We have a great place in Threeve Bay for assholes," he said.
– We have old buildings, lots of oak trees and beautiful areas to live in.
However, we don't know much about fakes, so work here and elsewhere will help you to understand what they need to be able to thrive."
It stresses that it is essential to check that there are no frauds before the start of the territory surveillance work, as the accidental destruction of one can kill up to 400 women and young people, and this can lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
Abrasives are protected and are prohibited from killing, exorcising or disturbing them, as well as from the destruction of their shells.
The Scottish Anti-Spare Fund official Elizabeth Ferrell urged society to contribute to the rescue of anti-Spare.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our cowards, and we don’t know how many local populations follow.”
Mr Ronaldo rejected the charges of extortion – the lawyers intend to refer the German Journal to the court
Cristiano Ronaldo called the charges against him by using “melagens ” and said that people, using his name,“ try to get drunk. ”
His lawyers prepared a German news magazine "Der Spiegel", which printed the charges to the court.
The Portuguese and Juventus club front-runner is accused of taking up the American Kathryn Mayorg in the Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that he had then allegedly paid the women $375 000 to make this an end to the event.
Speaking of 142 million followers alive in Instagram, after several hours after reports of accusations, Mr. Ronaldo criticized the reports and called them "melagins".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, "megagens," was spoken five times by Ballon d'Or, looking into the camera.
– They want to smell it on my behalf.
It's normal.
They want to be loud, to say my name is part of my work.
I'm a happy man, it's all right," said a sportsman with a smile.
According to Reuters, Mr Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to refer Der Spiegel to the court on the charges they called "unacceptable suspicion of the public disclosure of private matters".
Judge Christian Schertzas said that the sportsman would seek compensation for "moral damage, which would correspond to the significance of this violation, which is a good, one of the most serious violations of human rights over the past few years."
It is claimed that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the casino and hotel apartments in Las Vegas.
According to the documents submitted to the Nevada Clarko County Court, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the sportsman’s room in which he was allegedly taken by anal way after the night club meeting.
Mr Mayorga says that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo was attacked on the streets and told her that he was "99 percent good", which was issued by the remaining "one percent" of his personality.
The documents state that Ronaldo acknowledged that the couple had had sexual relations, but claimed that they had been contracted.
Mr Mayorga also said that she had contacted the police and that her injuries were photographed in the hospital, but later she agreed not to agree in court proceedings, because "the former actions of the defendants" and did not mean that they would be "publicly humiliated."
A 34-year-old woman claims that she is now seeking to withdraw the agreement because she still feels trauma to the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was a former man from Manchester, United, to the Madrid Real Club, and this summer, after signing a 100 million euro value contract, he joined the Italian giant Youth.
Brexit. United Kingdom would forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
According to Secretary of Business, Greg Clarko, the United Kingdom would be "always sorry" if after Brexito the world car production leader lost his status.
He was concerned about the statement made by Toyota in the United Kingdom by the BBC that, if Britain withdrew from the EU without an agreement, the production of Burnaston at the factory near Derbio would be temporarily suspended.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clarkes.
The Japanese car manufacturer claimed that the blow at the border would result in the loss of jobs without the agreement.
The Burnaston factory, which manufactures the Toyota models Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% are exported to other countries of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain suddenly left the European Union at the end of the war, our factory will have to stop production," said Toyota Director-General of Burnaston Marvin Cooke.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, also expressed concern about leaving the EU without agreement and its effects on international trade.
For example, BMW claims that after the month Brexit will close its Mini factory.
According to car manufacturers, the main threat posed by the supply chain Brexit without a contract is not covered.
The Toyota production line operates when necessary because the details of the cars produced by the order come from the UK and from existing EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If, on 29 March, the EU leaves the EU without a contract, there may be disturbances at the border; it may therefore be late to provide details or to lack them.
Toyota said that the Derbishyr plant could not keep more than one day's supplies, so production would stop.
According to Clark, the future relationship with the EU's Theresa May Chequers plan is "prepared precisely to avoid such border checks".
"We need a contract. We want to have the best contract, which, as I say, would allow us not only to enjoy the success of today, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told the BBC Radio 4 programme "Today".
“Not only Toyota, but also the data from other car manufacturers, show that it is necessary to continue to use a very successful supply chain system.”
Toyota could not say what time the production would be stopped, but warned that in view of the long-term outlook, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
For 24 years, Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at Burnaston's factory and at it, who was responsible for the trade union's meetings in the United States, said that his professionals were increasingly concerned: "I say from experience that if these jobs are lost, they will never return."
The government representative said: "We have proposed goals and confidence in future relations with the EU plan."
According to the White House, a short meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again
"Continuing the fight against the candidate for the Supreme Court's judges, a very important meeting of Donald Shorto with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be delayed for another week," the White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller – the latter is investigating Russia's interference with the elections, short-auxiliary relations with Russia and the possible impediment to the right of the President.
The question of whether short-term compensation would be granted to the Deputy Attorney-General, thus threatening Mueller's independence, has been the subject of several months' training in Washington.
This month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the microphone for recording conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the President by means of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected this report.
However, he went to the White House on Monday, in a moment of notice of his resignation.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations, would take place on Thursday.
A short statement was made that he did not want to forgive Rosenstein. Later, the meeting was withdrawn so that he could not agree with the Senate Court Committee meeting, where he witnessed both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who were sexually accused of him.
On Friday, the Short FTB agreed to investigate the allegations made by Kavanaugh and to put the vote again at the Senate plenary meeting.
The brief representative of the press, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday at the Fox news fair.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “His date is not fixed. He can happen this week, but with regard to all the events related to the Supreme Court, he may be withdrawn for another week.
But we'll see, I always like the press to report the news."
Some journalists do not agree with this statement: since September 10, Sanders has not held any press conference in the White House.
Leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the press conferences were rarely held because they did not like "Effect Watchers" TV journalists. True, he added: "I have to agree with the fact that they are looking for effects for viewers."
Then he remembered that Shorter with the pressure was more common directly.
"The President answers questions more often than any previous president," she said, and without any evidence, added: "We have reviewed this statistics."
Sanders says press conferences will be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is much better than talking to me.
We have often tried to do this and you have seen that in recent weeks this has been done many times. Press conferences will change your direct communication with the President of the United States."
A brief answer to questions is given by leaving the White House, attending public meetings or press conferences with honored guests.
One person's press conferences are rare.
The presence of the president before journalists this week, free and sometimes strange, must have explained why.
Minister of Health of Scotland's NST staff from the EU wrote about Brexit's concerns
The Minister of Health of Scotland sent a letter expressing the country's gratitude and the wish that they would stay after Brexit.
The Scottish parliamentary member sent a letter to Jeane Freeman less than six months before leaving the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of permanent resident applications for EU citizens working in the public service sector entrusted to it.
Mr Freeman wrote in his letter: “The Western UN and the EU's withdrawal negotiations have continued and are approaching the pending decisions this autumn.
But the UK Government has made preparations faster and a possible scenario without a contract.
I know you're all very upset now.
That is why I wanted to repeat how I appreciate the contribution of all workers – no matter what their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health care system are useful to our patients and communities.
The school is really your house and we really want you to stay here."
Emergency surgery performed by Christion Abercrombie
On Saturday during the result 31:27 Vanderbilt Commodores team lost the head trauma of the events experienced by the defender of "Tennessee State Tigers" for Christian Abercrombie, reported journalist "Tennessen" Mikeås Organ.
"Tennessee State" coach Rodas Reeds told reporters that the trauma occurred just before the break.
"He came to the side line and just snooped there," Reed said.
Trainers and doctors at the Abercrombie sideline were able to inhale the oxygen, then put it on the baby, and sent out further studies.
‘Tennessee State’ official Chris Harris of Nashvil (Tennis) WSMV said that the operation of Abercrombie at the Vanderbilt medical centre was finished.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type and extent of the trauma", while Tennessee State was trying to determine when it happened.
Antracures Abercrombie officially passed from Illinois and Tennessee State team played the first season.
Before leaving the matches, on Saturday he recovered five balls, and the total number of balls he recovered during the season reached 18.
The UK real estate buyers will have to pay a higher significant fee
Under new similar plans, the UK real estate buyers will have to pay a higher significant fee and additional money will be used to assist the beneficiaries.
This step will reduce the risk of a successful Corbyn campaign for young voters
UK tax-free persons will be taxed on the outstanding tax
The Ministry of Finance hopes that it will be able to collect up to 120 million pounds a year, and will allocate them to help the beneficiaries.
Today, Theresa May will announce that the UK is going to charge a higher rate of tax on non-residents who purchase real estate and receive additional money to assist the beneficiaries.
In order to ensure more affordable housing and to apply to large-income people, it is believed that this step will reduce the risk posed by the Jeremy Corbyn campaign to attract young voters.
The increased tax will be taxed by the UK-free persons and companies, and additional money will be allocated to the government to promote the non-profit campaign.
The additional fee, paid next to the current flag tax, including two years ago, for the second or three-percent rentals of higher rates.
The Ministry of Finance expects this step to raise up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's newly built real estate is purchased by non-US residents, and this makes it more difficult for buyers to do so.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time away from the country, so many of the rich countries and especially the capital areas became city figures.
The new strategy was presented just a few weeks ago, when Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the tax and thus helped more young people to buy the first houses.
He accused large construction companies of quickly buying land, but not using it, they maintain high real estate prices, and urged May to address the embarrassment of the British housing by rejecting purchased household allowances.
Corbyna has published several proposed housing reforms, including the control of rental prices and the ban on landing without guilt.
He also wants more power to build new homes for municipal councils.
May said: “In the years that I’ve been serving as a prime minister, I’m going to try to get the British dream back — every new time life has to be better.
This means that we need to adjust our damaged housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life here.
However, it is wrong that non-EU citizens and foreign-based companies can also buy houses easily as well as those working hard for the British.
For many people, the dream of having a home has become almost unimplemented, and the threat of undermining is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland's collective"
Sunderland's leader, Jack Ross, says his ultimate goal is to ever become Scotland's elected leader.
A 42-year-old skater likes the challenge of restoring the North-East club, currently in the third league place and three points away from the first-place club.
After returning to Scotland's championship last season, St. Mirren moved to Stadium of Light this summer.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I went to the crowd B and that's all over," Rossa told the BBC program "Scottland's Sports Sound".
“But in my childhood I grew up in Hamden Stadium with my father, looking at a lot of Scottish election competitions, and it always drew me back.
True, this opportunity will only take place if I have managed the club successfully."
Iki Rosso "Sunderland" led Dickas Advocatas, David Moyes, Sams Allardyceas, Martin O'Neillas, Roy ́s Keane, Guss Poets and Paulo Di Canio.
Earlier, after rejecting the Barnsley and Ipswich Town proposals, the former Alloa Athletic leader said he was not worried about starting to work after such well-known leaders in such a large club.
"Now my success will be assessed by the answer to the question "Can I return this club to the Premier League?"
According to the structure and conditions, this club certainly belongs to the Premier League, he spoke.
"But it's not an easy task to take him down, but I'm probably just going back to the club and I think I've been working here successfully."
Rosso's leadership career lasts only three years. He previously worked as a leader at the Dumbarton Club and for 15 months replaced hearts coach.
He later helped to get back to the third division of Alloa, and the St Mirren Club, which was threatened to fall, turned the winner next season.
Rossa says she is now more satisfied than ever felt through her career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic clubs.
"This change must have been radical," he recalls about the leadership of Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that it was better for me to follow – it is better than to play.
That sounds strange because I followed, earned a lot, and enjoyed a happy victory.
But playing can be difficult.
There are many problems that need to be overcome each week.
And now it's not easy – working stress and stress, but I feel that leadership is exactly what I need.
I have always wanted to lead, and now I do it. As I have always felt myself in my prayers, but leadership brings the greatest satisfaction."

The summer’s heat wave increased the income of poorly-cooked Britons, but further compounded the burden of the restaurants’ networks.
The figures revealed that the sale of loops and bar groups increased by 2.7 per cent, but income in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a business consultant in CGA, who prepared this data, said: “A never - ending sunset and longer than expected, England’s participation in the world championship showed that July continued to be a similar trend as in June, when the income of cattle increased by 2.8 percent.
June trade in restaurants decreased 1.8 percent and the July situation was worse.
The main income from beer and bar sales was undoubtedly the best, and trade in them grew stronger than in restaurants.
Although not as strong as the restaurant companies, the sunflower also affected the main incomes from the food supply.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
The sale of drinks in well-functioning wells and bars increased by 6.6 percent this month and the sale of food fell by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, an analysis company in the leisure and fertility sector, says: “These results continue to be visible from the end of April.
With regard to food establishments, the main factors remain the weather and the most important impacts of social and sports events.
It is not surprising, then, that restaurant groups continue to suffer. True, not one year's sales drop of 4.8 percent will be particularly painful, as it will contribute to the low cost pressure.
Most of the revenues from food-trading companies could not come at a worse time in the summer. Time will show if a milder August feels the temperature will give the necessary respiration."
The total sales growth in the shops and restaurants, including newly opened sites, was 2.7 per cent and reflected the slowdown in the development of networks belonging to trademarks.
The UK industry's guidelines for the aviaries, bars and restaurants are recognised as a tool for monitoring the sales of the "The Coffer Peak Tracker" sector to collect and analyse operational data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds.
One of five children has social media accounts hidden from parents
The study revealed that one of the five children – some of whom are only 11 years of age – have social media accounts hidden from parents and teachers
The 20 000 high school students survey revealed that more people would post "Insta" pages
News Strengthened Fear of Sexual Intentions
Twenty percent of students said they had to show their parents the main account
One of five children – some of whom are only 11 years of age – is a secret social media account and is hidden from adults.
The 20 000 high school students survey revealed that a rapid increase in the number of Insta pages is a reference to the Instagram photo sharing website.
News Strengthened Fear of Sexual Intentions
Twenty percent of students claimed to use a censored core account for their parents, but they also have secret accounts.
One mother, who happened to have a secret website of her 30 - year - old daughter, found out that the teenager was insistently offering: “Get me out of here. ”
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Directors Conference (MDK) found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-old students have two chapters, and half of such students have admitted to being missing.
The MDK leader Mike`s Buchanan said: “The fact that so many teenagers are willing to create virtual spaces in which parents and teachers cannot find them is worrying.”
Elidha Doyle will vote in the Scottish Sports Council
At the general annual meeting of the Scottish Sports Council Management Body, Elidha Doyle was elected as a consultant.
Ian Beattie described this step as a great opportunity for sport-led people to take advantage of a wide range of international experience in the past decade.
"Eilidha earned great respect throughout Scotland, the UK and the world's sports community, and we are confident that its inclusion in the council will be of great benefit to Scotland's sport," Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I want to serve as a sportsman’s voice and I hope that I will really contribute and help guide sports in Scotland.”

Thank you for the encouraging message."
Online breast-feeding advertising, where mothers are compared to cows, has received different evaluations
An undertaking producing breast fats has obtained different opinions on its advertising in which the feeding mothers are compared to the cubs of the cubs.
In order to mark the product described as the world's first silent chest appearance, the beginning of the trade, the technology company for consumers Elvie released an inhaled advertisement of the ironic music video. It aims to demonstrate the freedom provided by the new brands to the feeding mothers.
In this full caravan, four real mothers are dancing according to the sound record they hear, for example, the words: “Yes, I’m lying to myself, but I don’t see any curses” and “If you haven’t noticed, here are no witnesses, here are my breasts.”
The appendix continues: “Take him away, take him away, feed him with the young child, take him away, take him away, and lie down with my beautiful ones. ”
However, the advertising published on Facebook led to an online dispute.
The viewers responded differently to the video that was reviewed 77,000 times and several hundred comments. Many claimed that it was seen through the fingers in the dairy industry’s horrors.
"This product is a very poor solution for the advertising of cows.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and be born to produce milk, only after their newborn babies are taken from them a few days later," wrote one woman.
"Elvie" breast ring invisible space in the feeding trough ("Elvie" / "Mother")
Another commented: “It is understood that it is traumatizing both mother and newborn.
But why, when they don't use advertising to deliver a breast-feeding to mothers whose babies are not taken from them?"
Another added: “Advertising is a complete misunderstanding. ”
Another commenter’s ad defense: one woman admitted that her song appeared "very difficult".
"I think the idea is genius.
I'd buy it if I was still eating.
When I stopped milk, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a bit pointless, but I accepted it as what it is.
This product is brilliant," wrote one.
Another comment was: “This heavy advertising is intended for mothers whose milk is cut off (often in jobs or in toilets) and feels like cows.
It is not intended to drink or condemn the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women discovers that all shocks with tapes are undetected.
The idea of campaigning is based on the perception that many breast-feeding women claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie ring does not reveal any sound, has no wires or tubes and is incredibly space in the feeding basket, so women can move freely, keep babies, or even leave the house when the milk is taken off.
Mother's partner and executive director Ana Balarin commented: "Elvie" is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative start to trade it.
In comparison with the milk cows, we wanted to draw attention to the cessation of milk and all its challenges, but also to the extent possible by showing the incredible sense of freedom that will come from the new bottles.
The press release "Elvie" entered the press release not the first time.
During the London fashion week, the designer Martos Jakubowski’s collection of two children’s mother on the podium demonstrated using this product.
Quietly moved migrant children to the tent camp near Texas border
The number of people crossing the border during the month has not changed significantly, but the number of children of detained migrants has increased considerably, partly because of the severe rhetoric and policies of the Short Administration made it more difficult to accommodate them with their guardians.
Traditionally, the majority of guardians themselves were immigrants without documents and were afraid that the child's care would be at risk of staying in the country.
In June, after the Federal Government announced that potential guardians and other adult members of their families would have to present fingerprints and these data would be shared with immigration authorities, the risk increased.
Last week, the chief officer of the Immigration and Customs Service, Matthew Albence, told Congress that the institution had detained several ten people who had sought asylum for adults.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had not been tried before.
"Almost 80 percent of these people – guardians or their family members – live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
We will therefore continue to pursue these people," Albence said.
According to the adjudication staff, new rules have been introduced by officials in order to consider cases of children. According to some children, they must appear within a month of detention, not within 60 days, as was customary in the past.
Many of the requests to give legal status to the lawyer on immigration matters will try to defend themselves rather than personally but through a conference video call.
Unrecognised beneficiaries will be deported quickly.
According to the reports received by workers and in recent months from the system, the longer children remain detained, the more likely they will be to become restless or depressed, which may lead to forced entry or escape attempts.
The defenders say that this is even more worrying in large institutions, such as Tornil’s shelter: because of its size, it increases the likelihood of not seeing signs of child beating.
They added that moving children to a tent town without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can enhance the trauma many have experienced.
Syria, France and Turkey immediately ordered the occupation of the United States.
In addition, when addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Validas al-Moualem invited Syrian refugees to return home, although the war has been in progress for eight years.
Moualem, also attending the post of vice-president of the Minister, said that the anti-terrorist forces against the pretext are illegal in Syria and will be treated accordingly.
"They must depart immediately and without any conditions," he said.
Moualem claimed that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people had died since 2011, and millions had to leave home, the war on terrorism was almost over.
He claimed that Damascus would not be able to fight this holy until we destroy all Syrian territories and terrorist groups and any illegal foreigners.
There are about 2,000 United States troops in Syria, mainly training and consulting Kurdish forces and President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 land wars in a landlocked country.
Speaking about the refugee problem, Moualem claimed that the conditions for returning them were good, while he accused some Western countries of spreading unjustified fear that would deter refugees from returning.
"We turned to the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them return," he said.
"They are politicising what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria's recovery aid would be expected only when Assad and the opposition reached a political agreement and the war ended.
The UN diplomats claim that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey in the last major fortress in Idlibe has created the buffer zone for faster progress in political negotiations.
The Russia-Turkey Agreement has prevented the large-scale Russian-supported Syrian army from being attacked, directed to the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the terms set out in the agreement were clear. He also expressed hope that military action would be directed towards the jihadists, including fighters from the Nusa front, which will be destroyed.
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, looks forward to convening the first meetings of the Committee of the Government and the Opposition Members, which would prepare a draft Syrian post-election constitution and prepare soil for the elections.
Moualem set out the conditions under which the Syrian Government will participate in the committee: the work of the group must be limited to the revision of the current constitutional articles and warned not to interfere.
Why will Short be chosen for the second term?
On the basis of this logic, in 2020, the Short would be elected unless, as many liberal observers are likely to expect, his presidency would have ended in time.
Without a doubt, it would be the most dramatic ever to end the presidency!

From the best broadcasting time in 2014, CNNs have increased from more than twice to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has increased from almost three times to 1.6 million.

At least I'll never see Super Mario again.
"His actions remind you of the reality show, because every evening he's calling you something", about the changing members of the Short Show and the day-to-day waves of the battle with N.F.L. or behind Kim Jong-un, says the Director General of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the Pawn Stars, Brent Montgomery.

The fight against money from the environment in the middle of the term of office to the House of Representatives
It is no wonder that, due to the reform of the congressional districts, which ended with the attempt to win the same position by the two Members of the Court, the 17th district of Pennsylvania was inundated with money.
The recently repatriated Pittsberg district included a Democratic Member of the House of Representatives Conor Lamb – last spring he won his place during his special election in another district.
Lambas competes with another member of the House of Representatives – Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the previous 12th district of Pennsylvania. Much of it overlaps with the new 17th.
Mapping when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the violation of the constitution of the old districts had been falsified for the benefit of the Republicans.
In the new round of elections, in the 17th round, the financial institutions of the main parties – the Congress Committee of the Democratic Campaign (DKK) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRC) – were raised on the financial side of the campaign.
Lamba, in Pennsylvania, boasted when a small majority of the elections held in the 18th district of Congress won a wide - eyed election in March.
For more than a decade, the Republicans took over, and President Donald Shortas won 20 points in the district.
The political leaders gave the Democrats such a advantage.
The United States considered El Salvador to be punished for supporting China, but then forced
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, but did not essentially receive the negative response of Washington.
In June 2017, Trumpas attended a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and, until the partners emerged, he had a hotel in this country.
"Because of the decisions recently taken, the officials of the Department of the State of Taiwan decided to withdraw the leaders of the diplomatic missions of the United States from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama," said Heather Nauert in a previous report published this month.
However, sanctions are being considered only for Salvador, which received approximately US$ 140 million in 2017 aid, as well as for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial aid and the restrictions on visas for particular persons, would have been painful for the Central American country with a high level of unemployment and homicide.
During internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to take place after a similar meeting last year, which was considered an important step forward in order to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior administration officials clearly indicated the wishes for the conference to take place, and thus essentially completed any discussion of sanctions for Salvador.
"In order to show the importance of this meeting by the administration, the list of speakers for the conference planned in mid-October is now included by Vice-President Mike âas Pence`as," the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without reporting any threats or penalties to Washington.
The representative of the White House refused to comment on the details of the discussion that three American officials, including two diplomats, had mentioned to Bolton. They agreed to discuss internal discussions only if their anonymity is preserved.
Their statements are confirmed by the close external analyst to the administration, also by saying that his anonymity will be preserved.
Learn History
The Special Adviser Robert Mueller’s report on the possible obstacles to justice can now continue to be unavoidably awaited: his very strong evidence is now available in public archives.
In addition, as it is said, Mueller's investigation is asking whether the short campaign has not been carried out in secret in cooperation with our elections, Russia is damaging.
If the Congress were to move to other hands, this institution would have to assume responsibility at the same time as it is preparing to stand before the voters and perhaps finally before the Board of Governors.
There is a lot of "if" here and I do not say that the short end is inevitable – just as it matches in Europe.
We will all have to choose on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will determine whether the fight will continue for a long time.

We took and missed the opportunity to prevent a few years later from going to the slaughterhouses.
History revolves around such essential points of action – then an unfavourable sign of democracy is speeded up or suspended.
Now the Americans have come to a number of such essential points of effort.
What will we do if the short notice of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is the man from whom the fate of the Mueller investigation belongs?
Rosenstein’s problems began when this paper reported that last year the official proposed to register the president secretly and discussed his incompatibility with these duties.
Rosenstein claims that the "The Times" story is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the new FTB investigation by Bretto Kavanaugh is incomplete or incorrect or if this candidate will be appointed to the Supreme Court despite the convictions and false evidence?
And finally, in the mid-term elections, will we vote in favour of the Congress, which will force the Short to take on responsibility?
If we do not meet these tests, democracy is at risk for a long winter.
But for the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we will keep them.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia, and she was taken to Osvenzia with the same nation regime that was once established in the homes where I lived as an ambassador.

Graham Dorrans from Ranger's meeting with Rapid Vienna is looking forward to an optimistic
On Thursday, Rapid Vienna will assume that if he was able to win the impressive competitions with Villareal in Spain this month before the East, he would be in a strong position to leave the G group.
Due to the trauma of the middle player Graham Dorrans this season could only appear for the first time only in the 2nd result with the "Villarreal". But he hopes that the "Rangers" club can use this result as a trampline for more important goals.
"We had a good result because "Villarreal" is a great team," said a 31-year-old player.
“We started playing with the belief that we would achieve something, and we ended this achievement.
At the end of the day, we may have been able to be calmer, but in general, the competition was not bad.
They probably played the first race, and we hit the second, and we showed what we're the best team.
There will be another important evening in the European league on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points. The game will be difficult because in the last competitions their result was great. But I am sure that with the support of the spectators we can advance and achieve a good result.
Last year was really hard – and what happened to my injuries, and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good mood.
The team is good and the boys are really happy; the training is great.
I hope we can now move forward, forget the past season and play a successful game."

Although the interviewers had a clear picture of what kind of care they would like to receive, a few spoke to family members about it.
Approximately half of the respondents to the Nationalwide study said that they were talking to their spouses about the long-term care price.
Just 10 percent said he was talking to the kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but don't try to talk about it," said Vice-President Holly Snyder of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Company.
That's what we need to start with.
Talk to your spouse and children. If you do not report your wishes in advance, you will not be able to provide for your families.
Please discuss with the consultant and the family where and what supervision you would like to receive, as these factors may be important in order to provide for the costs.
Call the financial advisor. The advisor can also help to figure out how to pay these costs.
You may decide to pay these expenses for a traditional long-term care insurance certificate, mixed money with life insurance certificate or insurance your assets to the extent that you have money.
Select legal documents. Protect legal documents against legal disputes.
Choose a health care authority. Choose a reliable person who will take care of your medical care and ensure that specialists will respect your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Think, too, of the authority to care for your finances.
You should choose a reliable person who would make financial decisions for you and make sure that the accounts are paid if you become ineffective.

A man shot several times in an Ilfrac with a pneumatic gun
After spending the evening in the city, the man was shot several times by a pneumatic gun.
In the mid - 1930 ’ s, Ilfrakum Oxford Grauvo, Devon, was buried in the chest, belly, and hand.
At about 02.30 a.m., the officials described the shooting carried out during the summer of England as an accidental act.

Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia
"At least 384 died when on Friday in Indonesia, the city of Palu suffered a severe earthquake and tsunamis," the officials said.
As a result of the destruction of the communication aid services, officials were unable to obtain any data from the Regent of Dongal, north of the Palais area near the 7,5-inch earthquake epicenter.
In the aftermath of the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some of the most important facts about Paul and Dongal on the island of Slaves.
In 2017, about 379 800 inhabitants owned by Palu are the capital of the central province of Sulaves, located at the end of the valley on the northwestern coast of the island of Sulaves.
When the earthquake struck and the tsunami hit, the city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the year.
Dongala is a regent with a coast of more than 300 km (180 miles) north of the island of Sulaves.
In Regentia, about 299 200 people lived in the smaller administrative region in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic pillars of the province of Sulaves, in particular in the coastal region of Dongal.
It is also important in the province to have a nickel mine, which is mainly concentrated on the other side of the Sulawesian coast in Moravia.
According to the Indonesian disaster reduction agency, Paul and Dongala suffered several times over the past century from tsunamis.
In 1938, the tsunami in Dongal killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In addition, in 1996 the Danube tsunami broke out and killed nine people.
On the six - active Space Fire fires, there is a constant earthquake of earthquakes in Indonesia.
These are some of the most important earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
On 26 December 2004, a strong earthquake struck the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra, killing more than half of the people on the Indian coast.
At the end of March and early April, several strong tremors struck the western coast of Sumatra.
Nearly hundreds of people died on the island of Nias.
In 2006, the earthquake struck the southernmost populated part of the Indonesian island Java and caused a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
In 2009, the earthquake struck the area near the western capital of the province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
In 2010, the earthquake struck one nearby the island of Mentavaya in Sumatra and caused a tsunami with up to 10 metres of waves, ten villages, and about 300 people killed.
In 2016, because of the insatiable earthquake in Acehe, Paddy Jaya’s regents were devastated and panicked, as people remembered how everything was crushed after a terrible earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, the tsunami did not stop, but the collapsed buildings killed more than 100 people.
In 2018, strong quakes struck the well-known island of Lombok, Indonesia's tourists and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists temporarily landed on the coast.
The chief son of Sarah Palin is detained for domestic violence
As a result of the charges, Track Palin was arrested, the son of the former governor of the Alliance and the candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin.
The report published on Saturday by the Alaskan Police states that 29-year-old Palinas from Vasila (Aliaska) is arrested for suspecting domestic violence, preventing the notification of domestic violence and the detention of opposition.
As stated in the police report, when a known attempt was made to call the police to report suspected crimes, he picked up the phone.
As KTUU reported, Palinas returned to the pre-trial detention facility in Mat-Su and was released for $500 security.
"Today he appeared in a court where he was asked to sue, claimed to be completely innocent," the network reported.
The fine is charged with three Class A violations, which means that a fine of $250,000 may be fined up to one year.
He is also accused of a Class B offence, a day of imprisonment and a fine of $2 000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Palino.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a suspected attack.
The case is currently being examined by the Aliasko vet court.
This event is linked to charges against him for domestic assault in January 2016, for preventing him from reporting on the crime of domestic violence and for the detention of the armed forces.
His girlfriend said he broke her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was critical of the veteran groups, when the harsh behavior of her son was linked to the post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people died after Friday in the tsunami in Sulaves Island of Indonesia.
7.5 The earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks do not work. The number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake took place near the central Sulaves, north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
The social media shares video recordings showing the moment of the tsunami.
The tsunami hit the coast when hundreds of people were gathered to the beach festival in the city of Palu.
Federal Prosecutors of the New York Terrorist Attack seek rare death sentences
The federal prosecutors in New York are seeking death sentences for Sayfull Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people. This is a rare punishment that has not been committed in this country for federal crimes since 1953.
On October 31, thirty-year-old Saipov of Home Depot was suspected to have taken off the truck and set up an assault on the bicycles so far by the Western Master's in Manhattan – driving on foot and bicycles.
As stated in the report on the intention to seek a death penalty in the south of New York, prosecutors to justify the death penalty will have to prove that Saipova has deliberately killed eight victims and has deliberately caused serious bodily injury.
According to the court's document, both of these accused points may end the sentence of death.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal high-level jury announced to Saipov a 22-point indictment covering eight counts of murder related to the seizure of assets (usually in cases of organised crime by federal prosecutors) and the charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors say that the attack was very well planned and preconceived, and what Siopov did called it is a slick, brutal and immoral.
"Because of the actions of Sayfull Habibullaevicius Saipov, members and friends of the following families were injured, injured and related: Diego Enrique Angelio, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darreno Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernano Ferruchio, Hernano Diego Mendozos and Alejandro Damiano Pagnucco", the report on intentions states.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last case involving the death penalty was examined in the South New York district decades ago.
Khalidas Barnes was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but he was finally sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in 1953 in New York’s federal case for wife Julius and Ethelai Rosenberg, when they were sentenced two years ago for a bribe to the Soviet Union in the Year of Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were sentenced to death on June 19, 1953, in an electric seat.
On the basis of the documents of the court, Zeipov, who came from Uzbekistan, did not repent of his conduct either immediately after the attack or several months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the researchers that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Siopov revealed to the officials that he was inspired by images of the Islamic State (ISIS) that he watched on his phone to carry out the attack.
The police reported that he also asked the hospital to reinstate the flag of the Islamic State.
He did not confess his guilt in accordance with the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the defenders of the federal state funded by Siapov, said that they were clearly disappointed by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to pursue the death penalty, not to acknowledge the guilt and to punish the living head without the possibility of being released, will only prolong the trauma of these events to all those involved," Patton said.
Saipovo's defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek death sentences.
The rapporteur said that the Brexit negotiations must be responsible for NIGELA FARAGE
Today, through a protest at the same conference, Nigel Farage promised to mobilize the nation's army.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must feel Eurosceptics' heat, and one of the MPs from Theresa May suggested that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Member of the Conservative Community Chamber Peter Bonejas told demonstrators in Birmingham that the UK would now stand by if Brexit had been Farage.
But the difficulties that May faces in trying to bring together those who have been disbanded along the side of the side of the side have revealed the remaining points of the EU, which have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
It is difficult for the Prime Minister to implement a compromise plan agreed in the Czech Republic when it is imposed by Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
The Union strongly demanded that it seek to reach an agreement with Brussels despite its adverse reactions and force Eurosceptics and the Libyan Party to choose its package or chaos.
Bonejas, during the Leave Means Leave meeting, told Solihale that he wanted to break the Czech plan.
He claimed that Faragea had to be an equal partner and that he had to be held responsible for conducting negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were a leader, we would have already left the EU," he said.
The member of the Velingbor parliament added: 'I am fighting for Brexit', but we must reject the Czech Plan'.
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We fought in World Wars, not to obey others.
We want to adopt our laws in our country."
“Bone” denied the idea that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that British people have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is completely false.”
Brexit was also involved in demonstrations and journalists. "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chekers' plan is not popular among the general public, and the opposition will not vote for it, and it is not popular among our party members and activists who are going to the streets and, above all, voting for us.
Give up the Chekers plan and start listening."
In a critical report, May added: “The prime ministers kept their posts when they kept their promises."
The Faragejas said that feeding policies should be forced to feel hot if they issue a decision adopted by the 2016 referendum.
"This is now the issue of confidence in our people and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to issue Brexit, so today we're here to tell them that we won't let them get away with it."
Turning to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to force our political class, who almost issued Brexit, to feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the army of this country, which has brought us the Brexit victory, and we will not stop until we become independent, municipal and glorious in the United Kingdom."
And the enemies of Brexit, before the two-hour meeting in the city center, marched through the streets of Birmingham.
After this weekend’s group was set up, the board of activists took action on the posters “Torias v. Brexit”.
Leborist Lord Adonis took the conservative on the security issues that they had experienced as a result of the party's programme for the conference.
"Those people who say they can install IT systems and all the technologies needed for the Canada plus Plus option, for border-free and free trade without borders with Ireland," he said.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to take a serious look at the presidential elections
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections she would seriously consider whether to participate in the presidential elections.
Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat was talking about his future in a meeting with the public on Saturday evening in Massachusetts.
Warren, who constantly criticises President Donald Trump, participates in the November re-elections in which he will meet with GOP State representative Geoffu Diehlu, one of the leaders of the short campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was assumed that it could meet with Trump in 2020.
Since the time that Shortas became president, the Saturday afternoon event in Holjok has been 36 meetings with voters using the format of a public meeting with the public.
One participant asked whether she was planning to participate in the presidential elections.
Warren replied that the time had come for women to go to Washington and correct the government that was under way, and that must be managed by a woman.
Suspected in the LSU Sims decommissioning file
The police of Baton Ružo, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that they had detained the suspect who had been charged with LSU's arrest on Friday with Wayde Sims.
At 11.00 a.m., the Baton Ružo Police Department reported that 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson was detained.
The police distributed a video of the shooting on Friday and asked to help identify the man who was seen in it.
Twenty years ago, Samson was shot and died near the city of South University early on Friday.
According to "247sports", police chief Murphy J. Pauls reported to the media on Saturday that Wayde`s Sims was shot in the head and died of injuries.
Waydea stood up to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having a crime scene, had a gun and a show in Wayde Sims.
Simpson was detained without opposition and was imprisoned in the police department of the Eastern Baton Ružo district.
198 cm of high pre-second course student Sims grew Baton Rose, played 32 matches last season, 10 of which started at the start of the fifth, spent on average at the platform after 17.4 minutes, earned 5.6 points and recovered after 2.9 balls.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approached the world champion's title when the team told him to give the victory to Sebastian Vettel
When Walter Bott was on a qualifying ride on Saturday, Lewis Hamilton immediately realized that the instructions of the Mercedes team would be very important in the race.
The race started in the first place, and Bott was fine at the start and, defending his position in the first two stages, was hardly left in Hamilton’s trouble, encouraging Vettel to attack his team’s friend.
Vettelis first entered the two open garage, left Hamilton, and he ran back into the back of the group, so that was decisive.
Mercedes entered the two open garage behind the wheel and returned to the road behind Vettel, but Hamilton, after not having finished the operation in contact, drove ahead when the Ferrari driver after a double manoeuvre, in order to maintain his position in the third position, accidentally released the internal side of the track.
On the 21st day of Christmas, Max Vertappen started from the beginning of the reign, but at the end of the first wheel was already at the end of the seventh.
It was the fastest part of the race, because it was going without changing the tyres to make the fastest finish, wrap Kimi Raikkonen and finish the fourth.
At the end of 44, he entered the two open garage, but in the remaining eight wheels he was unable to increase the pace and Raikkonen’s finish line by a quarter.
“It was a difficult day for Walter because he had followed him well all weekend, and when I was asked to pass, he acted like a real gentleman.
The team worked well and sought out two first places," Hamilton said.
It was a really empty body language.
President Donald Short met with the people on Saturday, Senator Diana Feinstein, because this repugnant denied a letter by Christine Blasey Ford, in which a candidate for the Supreme Court judge, Bretta Kavanaugh, was accused of sexual abuse.
Speaking in West Virginia, the President did not directly refer Ford's evidence to the Senate's Legal Committee, but said that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are unfair, unfair and unfair.
"What could have happened and is actually happening in the last days in the Senate when you see anger when you see people being evil, rude, dishonest and unfair," he said.
“When you see official statements and disappearances, and then you say, “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you find out?
Do you remember her answer to the question, or did the document come up?
Not at all.
I didn't make it."
Well, wait a minute.
If we're dead... no, we're not dead," he added, imagining the senator.
Another July, Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's allegations to Kavanaughi that had been killed earlier in September, but Feinstein denied that the letter had been removed from her office.
According to The Hill, Feinstein's committee said, "I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations and her stories."
"She asked to keep it secret, and I did as she asked."
However, it seems that the president did not agree with her negative attitude, for he said at a meeting with people on Saturday evening: “You know, it was really a bad language.
It may not have happened, but it was the worst language I've ever seen."
The president, in continuing to appeal to the Supreme Court's judges, who were accused of having been sexually abused by three women, claimed that the Democrats had used the charges for their own benefit.
"They have chosen to restore power by any means necessary.
You see greed, impatience; they don't care what they're doing or what they have to move to get power and control," another president's speech "Mediaite".

The pilot died in order to help hundreds of passengers escape the earthquake
The captain of Indonesia’s flight was announced by a giant when he died with several hundred passengers flying safely into the air.
More than 800 people died, and the majority are considered the worst after Friday of the stormy earthquake on the island of Sulaves.
The site continued to be worn by strong repeated underground strikes and the majority of people were struck in the ruins of the city.
Although his colleagues fled to rescue their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Aggang refused to leave his post at the highly floating management box in Palu Mutiaros Sis Al-Jufri Airport.
He stayed at his place of work to help 6321 fly to the Batik Air plane, which was already on the way up, safely.
Then, when it was thought that the flight control tower was rough, he jumped out of it.
He died in the hospital later.
According to Australia's ABC News, Indonesia's air navigation representative Yohannes Siratis claimed that his decision could save hundreds of lives.
We escorted him to a larger hospital in the city of Balikpapán, California, with a helicopter from Kalimantan.
Unfortunately, this morning we're missing him, and we're not going to get to Paul.
"It is news to us without any pain," he added.
And the government is afraid that the number of deaths may rise to thousands, as the disaster reduction agency reports that the cities of Dangal, Sigio and Boutongo are hard to reach.
"The number of victims is expected to increase, because many victims are still behind bars and cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the agency.
Up to six meters high, the city of Palu will be destroyed; it will be held on the Sunday of the mass court.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Her 35 - year - old mother, Risa Kusuma “Sky News” said: “Every minute the fast cars come to the victims.
There's no clean water.
All around the self-catering shops."
The head of the International Indonesian Red Cross, Janis Gelfanda, told CNN: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
This is a tragedy, but the situation can worsen."
Indonesia's president, James Widodas, came to the country's army on Sunday and said: "I am writing all of you to work day and night in order to carry out all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" Reported CNN.
Earlier this year Indonesia was devastated by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that when an aircraft falls into a lagoon, one person is dead.
The flight that ended an aircraft crash in the Pacific Ocean basin of Micronesia, which is now operating on an airline, says that one man is a bad man, although earlier he claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were rescued from a flashing plane.
In the report, Air Niugini said that on Saturday afternoon they had no knowledge of a traveling man.
The airlines indicated that they cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and researchers in their search.
The airlines did not respond immediately to requests for further information on a passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The local boats helped to rescue other passengers and the crew when an aircraft attempted to land at the airport of Chuk Island fell into the water.
On Friday, the officials reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, all of which were stable.
It remains unclear what caused the accident and what was the exact outcome of the events.
Airline and U.S. Navy reported that the aircraft was landing in a lagoon without such landing.
Some witnesses of the incident feel that the plane did not have to jump on the landing like this.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane fell from a very low point.
"That was very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to crash before the crash.
He said that the flight attendants were panicking and shouting, and he himself experienced a slight head trauma.
The U.S. Navy reported that by repairing the nearby cargo, their mariners also helped to rescue the people who were blown by the boat to the shore before the plane crashed into a cave about 30 metres away.
According to Air Safety Network data, over the last two decades, Papua New Guinea has killed 111 people in aircraft accidents registered in New Guinea, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
The analyst set out the night when the woman was burned alive, the sequence of events
The Public Prosecutor's Office reported the facts available on Saturday in the case of a man who was charged with a life-burning woman from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used mobile phone records to connect the death of 29-year-old offender Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victims of Jessica Chambers' movement on the night of death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowletts said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chamber's death evening, which contradicts previous statements.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with Michael Sanford, the police went to check on Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford expressed his position and said that he had not been in his city that day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth by saying that he was on Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he was "laughing because his trucks were in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis claimed to know Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Mobile phone records show that they met each other for a week.
Rowlett said that after some time after Chambers died, Tellis removed Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
It is expected that the defence of its final arguments will start on Sunday.
The judge told me that the case would be handed over to the jury later that day.
"The High Breed": what is a conscious hippopus?

The High Breed from Bristol claims that the hippopus is far from the roots of political messages and draws attention to social problems.
They want to go back to the hippope sources and repopulate the conscious hippope.

One more black?
New York branch gave a couple after being fired from work on a "racist" message
The New York branch gave a couple for dismissal from work for discrimination after receiving the wrong message sent by the mother, arguing that she was "one more black".
The couple denied the racists and claimed to be "use".
The mother of two children Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman was surprised to learn that the new guardian Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived on the first working day of 2016.
“NOEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE AND ONE JUDGMENT” – Mr Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in the message.
However, she was sent twice not to her husband, but to Mr. Maurice.
According to New York Post, the ignorant Plasco-Flaxman felt uncomfortable and fired from work Mr. Maurice, claiming that the previous eve, who was an African-American, had carried out his work badly and instead hoped to meet the Filipinos.
Mr Maurice was paid for one working day and was sent by Uber's car.
Now Maurice has given a couple to the court for compensation and seeks to adapt even after 350 USD a day for half a year's life and work in the client's home, to which she was initially hired even without a contract.
"I want to show them that such things cannot be done," she said on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination".
The couple turned to accusations of racism and denied it and claimed that to forgive Maurice from work was reasonable because they feared that she would not be able to trust her after she was injured.
“My wife sent her what she did not want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said Joele Plascas.
"Would you trust your children to whom you were unmandated, even though that was wrong?
Your birthday?
They don't think so."
Plascas said that his wife was pregnant just two months ago and was “in a very difficult situation”.
Are you going to judge for that?
This is not very nice behavior," added investment banking specialist.
During the trial, the media tried to condemn a couple on social networks, criticizing their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington’s publishers are afraid that readers will not understand the spoken forest
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bondo, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to feel at another place that reads the book for the first time before it was released.
It is now very interesting to know what we know about the enormous success of Padington."
In saying that her father, who worked with the BBC operator before finding inspiration to write a book for children about a pine forest, would not be too surprised if his work had been rejected and added that the 60th edition year after his father’s death was pleasant and sad at the same time.
Speaking of Paddington, which she describes as "a very important family member", she added that her father was quietly proud of his success.
"He was a pretty quiet man and did not like drinking," she said.
“When Paddington was like him, he felt like he had a child who had achieved something: be proud of him, though it is not your job.
I think he similarly appreciated the success story of Paddington.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave his own reward to Paddington.
My daughter was upset, and I had to say hello to her on the phone.
After her daughter was released, she was rushed to the 2nd hospital in Nicos Louis Pasteur, where doctors were unable to save her life.
"Nada kept calling and said that the situation was really bad, it is not expected to survive," said Ednan-Laperous.
“Then I received a call from Nada, who called to say that she had been living for two minutes and had to say goodbye to her.
And I said goodbye.
I told her: “Tashi, dear, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Doctors gave medications that supported her heart rate, slowly ended up working and removed from the body.
She died a little before, and that was the end of it all.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing that all this is happening.
I couldn't fight, fight, or cry because I was in the environment, surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it to myself."
Finally, Mr Ednan-Laperous, now depressing his dead daughter, entered the plane along with other passengers who did not realize what a difficult trial she had to face.
"No one knew," she said.
"My head was cut off and the tears began all the time.
It's hard to explain why, but that's exactly why I felt a great pity for Nadu on the plane.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women’s openings are designed to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women, who have lost loved ones in death, try to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Wells Bridge distribute the openings with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call and ask for help.
Mr. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when depression hit him, and he killed the 18th.
"I don't want any father to feel like I have to feel every day," she said.
Dr. Davis, who lived in Lidny, said that her son had been a very promising boss, separating the insulting smile.
"Everyone knew him about his smile.
They always said that his smile would light up the room."
However, he did work before his death because he was “in the place of darkness. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11, found his brother killed.
Mr Davis said: "I am afraid that a chain reaction may occur."
“ To make people know that there are people in the world who can talk and talk, even if they are friends, ” wrote Dr.
Don't sit still, you have to talk."
Mr Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mr Davies, died of his 15 - year - old partner, Mark, who left his mother shortly after his death.
"He did not say that he felt depressed, overwhelmed by depression and no argument," she said.
“We observed his changed attitude a few days before Christmas.
During Christmas the situation was completely bad: when the children invented their gift, he did not look at them and did not respond at all."
She said that his death was a major injury to them, but they had to overcome it: “It left nothing in this system of things.
That makes our hearts rejoice.
But we all have to live on and fight."

Following an FTB study, the future of Bretto Kavanaugh was added to the hair
I thought that if we could really get something that he asked for – a study of limited duration and scope – maybe we would bring in a few units," said Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would be in the ranks of the strong parties.
Why did the sponsors of Mr Kavanaugh and his Republicans not want the FTB to start the investigation?
Their opposition is only a matter of time.
Until the mid-term elections, which will take place on 6 November, only five weeks remain, and if Republicans are expected to appear poor, their efforts to choose the person to the highest court of the country will be much weaker.
George’s W. Bush called the senators in an effort to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House, and through him met his wife Ashley, former Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen when the FTB submits its report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will take place.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh Senate can obtain 50 votes to allow Vice-President Mike Pence to terminate his contact and approve him to the Supreme Court.
After the government came to Kim, the number of deserts in North Korea was "reduced"
The South Korean legislator said that the number of North Korean deserts to South Korea decreased when Kim Jong-uns came into power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-segment, quoting data from the Ministry of the South Korean Union, said that 1 127 deserts were identified last year compared to 2,706 deserts in 2011.
Mr Park said that the main factors had been reinforced control of the North Korean and Chinese border and increased human smuggling prices.
Pchenjan made no public comments.
Most North Korean deserts are finally offered by South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally displaced.
Many fled across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers deserts to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forced to return them to their parents.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still technically fighting, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pchenjana in the centre of negotiations on nuclear weapons.
This happened after the historic US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un's meeting in June in Singapore, when both agreed essentially to make the Korean side of a nuclear-weapon-free zone.
However, on Saturday, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of not changing its sanctions.
"If there is no confidence in the US, we will not be able to trust our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be the first to fight unilaterally," said Mr. Ri at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Brett Kavanaugh dismisses as "sister" and claims that he does not deserve to serve at the Supreme Court
The minority leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh "sister" and said that he did not deserve to serve the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Mr. Pelosi made these comments during an interview held on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival.
"I simply cannot believe that if a woman did so, she would be said to be a wife," Mrs Pelosi said in her response to Mrs Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Court Committee on Thursday.
B. Kavanaugh emotionally denied the charges of having taken sexual harassment against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
In his introductory speech when he spoke about family and high school times, B. Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes unbecoming to shout or unbecoming.
He also fully condemned the former Democrats in the Committee, who had accused him of "a brat and coordinated destruction of the reputation", which was not organised by the Liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that he believed that the evidence provided by Mr Kavanaugh proved that he could not work at the Supreme Court because he revealed his country's attitude towards the Democrats.
"I believe that he has disqualified himself with his statements and with the attack of the Clinton and the Democratic Party," she said.
It was asked whether it would seek to eliminate Mr Kavanaugh, if his candidacy had been approved and the democratics had received a majority in the House of Representatives, Mr Pelosi objected.
“I will say so – if he lies to Congress or the FTB, it is not appropriate to go to the Supreme Court not only, but also to the court where he is currently working,” said Mr Pelosi.
At present, Mr Kavanaugh is the Judge of the District Court of Appeal of Colombia.
Mr Pelosi added that she was concerned about the possible decisions of Mr Kavanaugh on the current health law or the Roe v Wade case because he was considered a conservative lawyer.
During the approval meetings, Mr Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether to revoke certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for us to become a judge on the sidelines of the country's identity: "How wonderful!" said N. Pelosi.
Possible for women to use
This is a legitimate criticism: finally, months have passed, and even years have passed, which it cannot express without tears.
"When we're confused, we're calling," after 45 years, Panel Steinem told me.
"I don't think it's an unusual thing, do you?"
She continued: “One woman, the head of a certain company, helped me very much by saying that she was crying when she was gone, but she developed a method of crying: “I’m sorry, because I’m crying.
I'm really mad."
And she just went on.
It seemed to me like a genius."
Ashras is considered to be an acceptable expression of anger partly because it is essentially misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories is from one of the first jobs in which the men worked most and where I once cried for unspoken anger. Then I was the older woman of the pack myself, and the manager, who was always a bit of an ad, came up and jumped into the stairs.
"Never let them see those who are calling on you," he told me.
- They don't know you're busy.
They think you're mad, so you'll be happy to win."
A congressman from the Democratic Party of Colorado Patricia Schroeder worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Harts was caught on board abstention from the Monkey Business (aforism, which means that it is a time of ease) and withdrawn the candidacy, with deep disappointment Mr. Schroeder decided that there was no reason why he could not apply to the president himself.
“This was not a good idea,” he said after 30 years.
– There were seven other candidates at the time, so there was no need for one more.
Someone called me "Snow with seven drops."
After the campaign started, it was little time to raise funds, so she vowed not to announce the candidacy until she made $2 million.
It was an unparalleled struggle.
She noticed that some of the sponsors, offering $1,000 to men, only 250 to her.
"Did they think I was getting discount?" she said.

How the US and Chinese trading can be of benefit to Beijing
First saves were created in the US and China's trade war, and although the battle has not yet ended well, according to experts, the disaster can become of lasting benefit to Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Shortas gave the first warning this year of the earlier taxable principal products exported from China, including solar elements, steel and aluminium.
The strongest opposition took place this week, when new tariffs were in force for goods with a value of $200 billion (150 billion), i.e. half of the goods exported to the United States will be taxed in principle.
Beijing replied to all the measures in the same way, the most recent decision was the US customs duty of between five and ten per cent on goods with a total value of $60 billion.
China has vowed to fight the US tooth for tooth, and it seems that this second, according to the size of the world market in the near future, does not really intend to lose weight.
Washington's sanctions would only be mitigated if China complied with the requirements, but the US's public pressure would be too tight to China's President Xi Jinpingui.
However, the experts say that if Beijing properly destroys its party, the difficulties of trade with the US may have a long-term positive impact on China, as it will reduce the interdependence of these markets.
"The sudden political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for the economy of both countries is in fact far more dangerous than observers have so far recognized," said Abigail Grace, an employee of the Asia New American Security Centre.
According to the Syrian Foreign Minister, the country is ready to accept return refugees
Syria claims to prepare for a voluntary refugee return and asks for assistance in restoring the war-torn country for more than 7 years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Validas al-Mualemas said conditions are improving in the country.
"Because of the progress in combating terrorism, the situation in the territory has become much more stable and safer," he said.
The government is continuing its efforts to restore the affected areas and restore the normal situation of the terrorists.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions directed against daily life and well-being have already been established.
From the start of the war, the United Nations has left Syria some 5.5 million cheeses.

However, it also stressed that the country would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries supporting the emergence.
Europe defeated the victory of the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team, following the US team's final outcome 16,5:10,5, won the Ryder Cup in 2018 in Le Golf National Square near Paris (France).
The U.S. has already lost the sixth round in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in this country since 1993.
Europe returned when the Danish-born captain Thomas Bjorn's team gathered 14.5 points to defeat the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had a hard time following the entire tournament, launched a strike from the starting point directly into the water on the 16th of the day before Francesco Molinari.
Italian player F. Molinari visited all rounds and became one of the four players who achieved the result 5-0-0 since 1979 when the tournament acquired the current form.
In the United States, the player of the lowest ranking team in Europe, Thorbjornas Olesen, from Denmark, won the Jordan at 3:4.
The highest ranking in the world, Dustin Johnson 2:1 lost English to Ian Poulter, who was probably playing his last tournament of the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia of the eight Ryder Cup tournaments became the most successful European player ever, gathering 25.5 career points.
"I rarely wish, but I cannot manage today.
It was not an easy year.
I am very grateful to Mr Thomas that he chose me and believed me.
I'm very happy, very happy that we get the cup back.
Everything depends on the team, and I am glad that I was able to help," said S. Garcia after the European victory.
He transmits the staphyte to his parents to John Ramu, who in the Sunday unit game 2:1 inspired the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods.
"I was incredibly proud to defeat Tiger Woods – I grew up watching him play," Rahmas said 23 years old.
Woods lost all four of his cats in France and now belongs to him 13-21-3 Ryder Cup career record.
This changes statistics to one of the best players of all time, the winner of 14 biggest prizes and giving only Jack Nickles.
The U.S. team failed to turn the whole weekend into a driving wheel, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who demonstrated a high-level game during the entire tournament.
“ I am proud of these men, and they are fighting, ” said the U.S. captain Jim Furykas after the depressing team.
There was a moment this morning when we started printing Europeans.
We sang.
I'm taking my hat to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to put your head down.
Our enemies were more prosperous."
