The main task of the kings was to build a tomb, from which one thought that it would seem as timeless as the stars over the sand of time, in which everything else faded. The planning of the survival was more important than the life itself, which was only the way there. Wars led them to remember quietly at the walls of this tomb, in which the scenes were measured. Of course, much was speeded up, and in later times even battles were presented that had not even taken place.
