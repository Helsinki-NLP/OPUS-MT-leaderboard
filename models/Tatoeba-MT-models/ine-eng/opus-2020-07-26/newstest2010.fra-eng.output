Barack Obama will be the fourth US President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo in Norway to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth American president of the story to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be awarded to him, among other things, for his exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and have a programme.
It will first go to the Nobel Institute, where it will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who elected it in October among 172 people and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple then provides for an interview with the king of Norway Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will meet its summit in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious reward.
He will be the fourth US President to receive it, but only the third to be awarded the prize in the Committee itself.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the time of the award.
The President does not want to avoid this because he is aware that he is receiving this prize by being a president who carries out a war in two countries at the present time.
He reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics would forget to mention.
During the ceremony Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check of ten million Swedish crowns (about 1.1 million Euros).
He is counting on making contributions to charitable works, but he has not yet decided which.
His program will then take him along with his wife to a banquet that includes, in addition to the king and the queen of Norway, the head of the government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at this price at the beginning.
For example, he mentioned having the feeling not to deserve it fully.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for himself, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
From the announcement, he stated that it would be an "invitation to act".
A defendant of the accused nature of blackmail
The Lithuanian Police accused the President of blackmailing the Association Society of the Protectors of the nature of Lithuania.
On several occasions last year, he appealed for several construction works procedures and asked for the investor's money for his personal profit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokesperson for the Lithuanian police.
The President of the Society of the Protectors of the Nature of Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and is at risk for up to three years in prison.
Waste trims are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can choose their drinking packages, while in the villages of South Moravia you fall on trinets at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you should take a few minutes before you find the right goods.
I'm not saying that we wouldn't be able to manage all the waste in Brno.
But I feel that the municipal councillors of our city, the second largest city in the country, are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is at the age of three of the wastes, not only because citizens can only choose paper, glass and PVC, but especially because of the number of wastes.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle in the city center?
It's a whole science, which especially requires time and steel nerves.
The only place I've found for the moment is Moravia's place in front of Potrefena Husa.
Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't want me to, but I don't think so.
Without talking about the fact that in other neighborhoods of the city this is not a safe one anymore.
So to end, many of my friends don't choose their waste.
By the way.
It's a trick for them to get to the goods.
I'm not surprised about them.
myself, after a party, I proposed to go throw some bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't see any Kounicova street color bands.
Luckily, I found the right place by going to take the tram.
That's what it says, the waste was getting away with.
It's after the whole centre of Brno, which is supposed to best represent the city, right?!
It is likely that ecology and alleged aesthetics are not too interested in the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy the city a first hockey league place that shames the city all over the country, instead of buying some extra goods and offering the three more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am happy to have been able to comfort my impression with official statistics after spending a moment online.
According to ECO-KOM data, Brno is really the worst in the entire Moravia region of the South.
Paroubek's budget has been removed from retirement and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the government's opinion, farmers or employees may lack money for retirement, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for the interests of the State's debt or international judicial procedures.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the social-democratic and communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government would make loans for sensitive spending, retirement or sick leave. "It's just to solve the problems later, to mine the land," Janota said.
It must be known that the interest to be paid on money is increasing and that it will have to be repaid sooner or later.
The state doesn't really have the choice to know where to put the money.
If it does not reduce social aid or its expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those who have now increased to the left: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and should not fear for their retirement or sickness insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a larger government debt - next year it will not be missing 163 billion in cash, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, debt will increase more and more quickly and with it, interest-related expenditures.
The State will need money to feed it, and it will not be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
It will also lack five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to some groups of electors.
This is mainly a decision-making and start-ups that may not be possible to change the projects to reduce costs.
Always keep them, which is not free or free.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major construction sites, and the collection of European funds is also in danger, according to Karel Hanzelka's warning, spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD proposed to settle the financial deficit very quickly - it will be able in the ČEZ dividends (power supplier and electricity distributor), that the State have a major share and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is not in any case a well without funds.
Last year, it was 18 billion who have been navigated from the Czech Republic to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of environmental damage, to supplement retirement accounts, or to reserve pension reform.
This also increases the actual budget deficit of 5.7 per cent of GNP according to EU rules.
And it's far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various damages to the victims of communism and crime, even housing savings, has reduced by nearly three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we forgive an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, says Janota.
The Minister will then have to save from the department or, worst of all, touch the government's budget reserve.
There is also a lack of one hundred million in the two-billion-dollar State Fund project, which should allow for an online monitoring of the expenditures of each administration.
The first stage will begin in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would have taken place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing one button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
It's enough of a button and you'll be passing from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American company VMware, which primarily deals with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can change between them, you can distinguish them in staff and professional
Both will work at the same time, Srinavas Krishnamurti of the VMware company said in an interview for the Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and it was first demonstrated a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is nothing but fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, with a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a Nokia N800 modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, which was simultaneously running the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is currently working with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to the current devices in 2012.
The snow shortage in the mountains disturbs the hotels
The desert trails are only problem for lift-up operators.
The lack of snow deters people from booking their ski stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to destroy free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits on our website.
Netizens travel through offers, demand prices, but do not hesitate to book for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud in Noël," said Martin Jandura, exploiting the Spindl.Info information portal.
If you want to spend the New Year's dreams in Špindlerův Mlýn, it's better not to hesitate to book.
If economics are given priority and the quality of the accommodation comes only immediately, then we can try to wait a few more days.
Špindler's hotel offers only one week's stay for New Year's Eve.
I think they're going to try a second more time to place them, but they're going to drop them, too, and they're going to accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura estimated.
The Ingtours of Vrchlabí tourism agency also offers free beds for all winter periods.
We are most interested in Christmas for the moment, it is not completely sold.
It still remains free, let's say, half the rooms in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared some less expensive Christmas stays," Ingtours Petr Schiefert said.
The Vrchlabí Tourism Agency can also offer New Year in Krkonoshe, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February go as well, the remaining winter stays are sold on average.
This year, interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoshe.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter on the mountain without snow.
If the tracks are covered during the week, Christmas will also be complete," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, the hotel's occupation of Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of almost five percent.
We have a few last seats for New Year as for Christmas.
There is great interest during the holidays of January of the Polish and February also sells well," reports Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The hotel Omnia near the central parking lot of Jánské Lázně is also complete at four-twenty percent during the New Year's period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty in Noël in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we have already had sixty percent of employment at the present time.
February is a little lower for the moment but as the snow falls, the interest for stays in the Krkonoše will grow even more certainly indicated the hotel manager Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The hotels in Krkonoshe, however, should not expect more snow.
Thursday it will be fresher and if there are precipitations, they should be snowed in the mountains.
But then the time should be warmed up, reports Jiří Jakubský of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute Hradec station.
United States: Repeating is a mother of wisdom
He became even a comic, the earnest effort with which Barack Obama, president of the reputation of wisdom, reproduced his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan issue, which he considered himself to be simple.
When he ended up sweating his doctrine so eagerly awaited, he found that he had copied it to the carbon paper since Bush's Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even several times the expression "like in Iraq", he did not hesitate, which is, to use the title of Bush's January 2007 speech as the title of his own speech: "A new road ahead"
At the same time, he personally criticised Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements into a Iraq consumed by civil war as "an irresponsible and catastrophic decision in its consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which contained recommendations from campaign commanders, was the only possible and most likely success at this point that newspapers at present do not speak of Iraq as a whole.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, as he said, objectively speaking, he left his successor a much more favourable final situation that we could not hope for.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will reproduce
These are once again campaign commanders who asked for an increase in the military contingent, including the Afghan Operation Commander, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the reticence of the White House despite the habit of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 men to make the situation more favourable.
The President hesitated for three months, but in the absence of a better option, he called at least 10,000 soldiers in general.
He managed to draw out the promise of 5 000 additionals on the part of Europe, even if it was over 10 000 originally.
What is causing the most problems in the whole Obama strategy seems to be his intention to remove Afghanistan's armies by 18 months and to complete all this process by three years. The whole Obama doctrine raises more questions than it does not provide answers.
Many doubt that an increase in half will produce the same fruits as progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by the exact opposite - one cannot rely on anyone and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing leadership from day to day according to their arrangements.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will only remain the dust behind which will spread patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups, given the lack of clarity in relation to the reports, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "prompt state to act", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The temporary horizon of Obama's strategy makes it perplexing by its volunteerism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only made it more difficult and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and out of reality can be convinced that the small soldiers sent into the tumult of war for their "soon return to the house" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will consider it to be the indirect asset of the US defeat.
NATO's latest summit showed that the Europeans' willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is directed to the negative.
European politicians do not know or want to explain to their voters what security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions have no impact on Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult question of a solution to the problem by using the military force.
It will have to be answered, for example, when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of Afghanistan's troops.
However, each such solution will lead to a dramatic return to the Afghan situation.
The only rusty for Obama is that he remains three years until the presidential elections and therefore he remains long enough to plan for a new strategy, if it would prove to be a total fiasco.
The leaders of the Goldman Sachs bank will no longer receive cash premiums
Top-ranking employees from the US Goldman Sachs bank will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
The company announced it to respond to strong criticisms about its wage practices.
The group of 30 main leaders will receive actions instead of money, which they will not be able to resell before five years.
Actions may be withdrawn from the leaders if they take too many risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus takes the lead in the effort to link the remuneration with long-term performances on Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the overall sense to take, said former banker of investments Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan's company
The interest is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank has become the target of criticism after almost $17 billion for prizes in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will probably exceed $20 billion, despite the measure announced today, according to the Reuters agency.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, the strong premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it was counting on a single tax of 50 per cent of the bankers' bonuses of over 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have won Nobel prizes in all areas outside physics
These are five women, a record number, who today received in Stockholm from the hands of the king of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel prizes in technical and literary disciplines.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, with their compatriot Jack Szostak, received the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemical price was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonathan with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz to have clarified the structure and function of the ribosomals
The last winner received the Nobel Prize for Economics, American Elinor Ostrom and his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that had not won this year was physical.
This prize was given today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD pieces, which are currently based on all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the cash reward.
It reaches ten million Swedish crowns in each category. (about EUR 1.1 million)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward between them.
The very expected Nobel Peace Prize has already been handed over to US President Barack Obama this afternoon in Oslo in Norway.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his reward as it was only at the beginning of his journey and that it was also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the discharge of his policy, he added that in some situations the war was essential for peace, even if the price was high.
Minister Janota intends to resign. Klaus invited him to Château
President Václav Klaus will receive the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who will stay with the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for the next year as voted by the House of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps the position of Janota in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their meeting on Friday.
Claus also criticises the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which increases the public finances crisis.
It was Presidential spokesman Radim Ochtat who informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his function on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation that will be submitted to Klaus' signature, it is a 163-billion-dollar deficit that the Czech Republic should manage.
However, the House of Deputies validated the proposals on the left on money transfers on Wednesday and increased the remuneration of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government criticized the proposals of the democratic social partners for indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement was born between the left of one side, the government, Klaus and the right of the other, which raised the future of Fischer's firm, which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, as voted by the Members, removes the package of economic measures passed by the Fischer government and that it has to claim the debt of the State.
Klaus, who can ratify the State Budget Act but which does not require, said today during a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs that politicians have long ignored the "serious problem" of the "refrisible deficit" of public finances.
Now there is, according to him, no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could improve, if it could rely on a consensus of the broader political parties, according to the president.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek pointed out that the budget is being spent and that the government should challenge its subsequent existence.
The Vice-President of ODS Petr Necza told CZK that the idea of an administrative office supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Verts does not function clearly anymore.
In his response, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as "dradicic verdicts".
The head of ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is fading and that it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, ČSSD successfully qualified for State budget ratification for next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new movie
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood Invictus - Invaincu film will show the world a lot of things about the country, its fights and its victories.
The story speaks of sports, relationships between races and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an American actor in the Oscars, incarnates the film on Nelson Mandela's life, tireless combating apartheid's racist regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said it's a 14-twenty-one-year-old Mandela who asked him to incarnate him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally..
The 60-year-old actor who was rewarded with a prize for his role in the Million Dollar Baby drama of Clint Eastwood, located in the middle of the box, has, for example, incarcerated the leader of a movement against slavery itself, a fictional president of the United States, even God in the movie Evan Almighty but never anyone alive and so important for as many people as Mandela.
The former South African State man was imprisoned for his hard work for the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
An invincible Latin word is called the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of Nelson Mandela's joint efforts and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. President Mandela has recently chosen to know that his country remains and is still racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people by sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the guests in the world.
The South African team will make progress in the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked a few years to bring Mandela's story on the screen.
I had no other purpose than to play this role in order to bring it closer to reality," Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was of course to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international political man were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to dinner with him, to be in a hurry before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to close his hand.
I realized that when I closed my hand, I recovered from your energy, it passed and I had the impression that I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the movie François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard middle of the rugby.
For him, his first encounter with Pinaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I dreamed at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, 'I look much bigger in the film'.
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the cover of the director Eastwood has received positive advice and even talks about ambitions for the Oscars.
The film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety newspaper summarized his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well realized film."
In film evaluations on the rottentomatoes.com site, Invictus received 76% of positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is resolved: the Russians were testing a shooting
A strange light phenomenon of unknown origin was observed above Norway.
The Russian Defence Department recognized only yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile not far from the Norwegian borders.
However, the launch was still a failure and the "Bulava" missile, which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, gradually became the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence during the shooting tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or she got damaged in full flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as "mission that doesn't fly"
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th test normally took place at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was again damage to the device.
It is clearly the engine of the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which sailed under the surface of the White Sea.
This kind of missile can be just fired by a moving and immersed vessel
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was probably a defective "Bulava".
In the meantime, the Norwegians did not doubt that this was a Russian shooting.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot talk absolutely of failure.
The first two floors of the rifle were resistant and the vessel only touched the third.
In the previous cases, the engines have experienced failures on the first floor.
Although none of the tests were conducted without acceleration, the department's management considered that only six out of thirteen failed.
This rate of success of nearly fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and therefore they always claim that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will carry even ten hydraulic nuclear cores of a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at 51
The legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will again appear in a 51-year-old professional match.
The former world champion, the Olympic champion and holder of Stanley Cup will hand in hand to his team of the Moscow CSKA in need and will make his likely entry during the Friday match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who finished his career for forty years in 1998, is now the president of the Cska.
After Denis Kuliash's injury, we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still need to settle some details about the form, says Coach Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by AP agency.
It has not been specified if the comeback of the legendary hockey player will only concern one match.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mind of the other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return to ice, Fetissov thus becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and obtained 15 goals and 26 assistances.
The oldest of the famous Fettisov, Kassatov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among the most successful.
Under the colours of the Soviet Union, he doubled gold in the Olympics, seven world championship titles, won the Canada Cup and the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected tributes in NHL where he twice held Stanley Cup.
He has been a member since 2001 of the Temple of the Name of the Hockey.
Hyundai listens to the unions and cancels all extra hours
The management of the Hyundai plant in Noshovice agreed with the unions to cancel all additional hours.
It is precisely because of the frequent additional hours that the trade unions have declared an emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesperson Petr Vaněk of the Hyundai factory confirmed it.
The management, however, still wants to agree with the trade unions on a Saturday this year.
We can't give up our production plan, it's essential, that's why additional volunteer hours were proposed on Saturday 19 December, knowing there would be two teams, said Vaněk.
The Sedmička.cz site indicated that the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech crowns to the employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
It will also be awarded a posterium for the day worked on 28 November.
According to Vaněk, the company decided to change how to motivate its employees in exchange for additional hours.
Whether they receive the supplement for the extra hours, or they can put a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their end-of-year celebrations to Vaněk.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and lunch.
Given that the extra hours were the most urgent and hotst point in the comments and claims of the trade unions as workers who spontaneously stopped production last week, the management immediately decided to cancel all the extra hours for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, car factory employees were forced to work almost every day for two hours in excess of their eight hours.
The trade unions intend to cancel the strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiations between the direction of the motor vehicle and the trade unions must take place on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader Petr Kucharæ said Wednesday that they were ready to end the strike status in the event of agreement on their claims and signature of a joint document.
The situation in the plant culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees were spontaneously stabbed due to excessive extra hours.
They also protested against the poor conditions of wages and alleged beatings.
The management defended the fact that employees had to work in addition to filling the car production imperatives.
In the announcement of Monday's strike, the trade unions also requested that no sanctions be imposed on workers who had ceased production.
Trade unions are asking the company to reduce the time spent in additional hours to a minimum.
In addition, they want a refund of 5,000 SEK (209 €) this year for them.
The Hyundai car factory in Noshovice currently employs 2,000 people.
She started production in the series last year in November.
It has manufactured about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech Discovery: a substance that works on HIV "long-lasting" viruses also
A team of Czech and German scientists tests new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to medicines.
This reality, in some cases, takes over the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on the current variants of the virus as well as some medicines already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at present.
However, we can radically prolong the life of patients through a combination of medicines that prevent the reproduction of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption results in a series of secondary effects.
In addition, the suppression of this multiplication has the effect of developing what is called resistant viruses on which medicines no longer have an effect.
The work of the experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way for dealing with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalliccarbons act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metal carborans are a mixture of copper, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way than all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers' work leads them to discover new "improvements" substances based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their connections to the proteins of the virus.
The metal carborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-wall cages are formed by the atoms of copper, hydrogen and carbon and are connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A betrayed and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a HIV protein that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus division caused by the HIV protease, there would be no occurrence of infectious mature particles of the virus.
If HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus will also be stopped in the patient's body, explaining the researchers in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little lower but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in trials as well as in its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metallic carborans is not as strong as on clinical medicinal products, however it is not limited to resistant versions against which current medicinal products are often ineffective.
Therefore, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are interesting combinations to consider further to the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Rezáčová, Director of the Structural Biology Laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Debates of the European Parliament and of the Council
The President of the ODS (Democratic Civil Party), Mirek Topolánek, has qualified as the "ffarant" the approved budget for the following year and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should challenge its existence.
The Prime Minister has qualified the DSD's proposals for drastic verdict.
He says it takes time to analyze.
The spokesperson of ODS Petr Necza stated that the idea of an administrative office supported by ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party did not function clearly anymore.
According to Necza, the head of the government should decide to join the House of Deputies in support of the minority who is concerned about combating the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned about remaining in his office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Necza warned that the positions of the ODS and the democratic social partners in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The House of Deputies ratified the 2010 budget on Wednesday, however, with proposals for changes of 12 billion crowns included on the left.
The House has increased the money for employees' salaries, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government's complaint to the proposals of the democratic social partners was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the room before the vote, thus obeying the Government's wishes as if a modified budget was a lower option than an interim budget.
Deception and inuselessness
Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer indicated that the government will still reflect on the current situation.
Neczar is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave his post in case of ratification of the amendments proposals, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota met with the prime minister on Monday after his visit to the government:
He indicated at the same time that he wondered if he would remain in his office.
His disappointment over the negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Necaj believes that ČSSD representatives, who have imposed the budget changes, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also state clearly that he will resign if the House ratifys other laws that increase the deficit, such as those relating to sickness insurance, retirement, or the reform of the Service Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the case of the head of the Fischer government and of the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS have done no harm, said Topolánek in a textual communication from the United States.
He recalled that the vice-ministers of certain departments were calling for TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Neczas pointed out that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of a struggle against the amount of government deficit, "it is all logical and correct that it is based on the left-hand majority that is currently in the House."
This, he said, should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I didn't think about it, and once it's on the agenda, then I will devote myself to it, said from the House to journalists, the Minister of Defence Martin Barták, elected to the government just by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer turned to the European Council in Brussels in the afternoon.
The ODS has taken a step back at the request of the Prime Minister.
Neczas also stressed that ODS would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not specifically asked the democratic Members to allow the budget to vote.
We do not have the feeling of being orphans, we are not small children, has he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not responded to the criticisms of the Chairman of the House Party or in the country during the negotiation of the budget.
I did not notice that my vote would have failed.
I already knew at the time when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a Bolshevik of the House and a destruction of everything that was positive, Topolánek reacted in person.
According to the new ČD schedules, there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit from 13 December certain less-charged express or regional trains and will strengthen them rather than others.
The total coverage of transport will decrease on the date of entry into force of the new two-percent times compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including basic tariffs and reduced tariffs.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region who will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino branch.
On the contrary, an express stopped serving Bratislava.
There will also be less fast trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct line Prague - Letohrad will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport concerns the region of Hradec Králové as a whole, in contrast to Prague and its surroundings, can be welcomed by an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague line - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled and the circulation of some express trains on the Prague line - Písek - České Budějovice will be reduced to just a few days a week.
Among the major transformations is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the time being, the inhabitants of Milovice must change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko banner system, whose opening is possible due to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines towards the capital will have their final destination at the main station of Prague (Praha Hlavní nadraží).
The ČD will introduce more lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Shumperk/Jeseník will start at intervals of two hours.
Travelers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino until Bratislava from December 13th.
This year's bill for regional railways: 200 million additional crowns.
Express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Railways next year in all four billion crowns to settle the visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions that pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the State will participate at almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a contract for ten years, so far it has always been a year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they did not use an increase in the price of the large majority of transport securities.
Changes will only affect tickets for a day ČD Net and internet tickets at reduced prices eLiška.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will again depend on the route, while until then it was valid between cities of a region to choose and was at a single rate of 160 crowns.
The Philippine rebels are still holding over 50 people, children have been released
Today, the rebels have taken 75 people to the south of the Philippines, some of which are students from a primary school and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed them, but spoke of the origin of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The taking of hostages took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 rebels were reported to have used hostages as human shields during a police escape.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the army branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP, the police first pursued the abusers following violence in a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
Mortal law was declared in the province of Maguinanao south of the Philippines due to a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Of the victims of the 23 November massacre, 30 journalists were involved in the governor's administration elections.
The governor of this province of the Philippines of the South was arrested following suspicions of participation in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential line of the Ampatuan.
Mindanao also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in the US halls in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Neporažený), and tells a part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned apartheid fighter came back to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen by Mandela himself for years to incarnate him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was assigned to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in the halls, the return of critics and the public is heard.
Nelson Mandela
He was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvesu in South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, then in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize next to Klerk.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film has great hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is on one side fully prepared for the World Cup of Football, and on the other because the media are agitated by worrying news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the people of the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, the reactions to the new film are now rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations to the main roles where Hollywood stars are "passing".
However, Morgan Freeman is proud of the film by retaking his own terms.
I've dreamed of this role for years and I've been well prepared.
I have also often personally met Nelson Mandela to be able - as it is said - to recover from his energy, did he indicate at the first official film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember Mandela's personality and message through the film.
It is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but this concerns each individual has added.
Bringing the rugby national team's battalion
The film based on the history of the British writer John Carlin is freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave its creation to the people represents the South African defender of human rights during his mandate to the presidency.
Morgan Freeman is therefore trying during the film to collect two racial groups of a long divided population and Nelson Mandela in 1995 amongst the national mallow of the South African team on the world's cutting hair, which South Africa had won at the time.
Mandela had been ovated for fourteen years, mainly from the white population, and was recognized by the white population, to be seen as something sacred in South Africa.
Let's hope that the football championship will succeed in bringing people together again in one nation, said the Rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" of the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen whether the South African situation will improve.
The South African whites are, however, skeptical as they have recently been entrusted with an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who has fled to Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
A transformer with tens of millions of crowns in flames in the Louny region
A fire struck a transformer from the company Čeps of the distribution centre near the municipality of Výškov na Lounsku in the morning.
According to Lukáš Marvan, spokesperson for firefighters in Ústí, there are six units working on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer consume, but they reviewed their opinion and set fire with a mixture of water, mousse and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to Pavla Mandátova's spokesman, the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the whole transmission.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure may be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandatova, the destroyer will have to be replaced by a new one.
She added that in ten years of activity, Čeps had no such knowledge and that incidents of this type were isolated.
The supply of electricity was not interrupted, says CheEZ's spokesman for the North Bohema Soňa Holingerova Hendrichova, the operation of households, administrations and industries was not influenced by the fire of the transformation station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of transmission sets and electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, refurbishs and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electricity from transport sets to distribution sets and lines of 4339 km long.
Janchura will file a complaint for defamation against three prefects of the ČSSD
Radim Janchura, the owner of Student Agency, will now file a complaint for defamation against three democratic social prefects.
And specifically against Michal Haszek of the South Moravia region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the Prefect of the Olomouc Martin Tessarík region.
Janchura indicated it in twenty minutes of Radio Journal.
The complaint relates to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions have concluded long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of us have attacked and claimed to make ends meet, while only one offer was made for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways than what is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So we're only left to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for the complaints about the Student Agency, Janchura said in the Radio Journal.
It has also indicated that there is evidence that no region has acted in accordance with European law.
This is why we are preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Haszek considers that Mr. Janchura's filing of complaints is the result of his media show, which serves him for free advertising for his company and for his person.
Of course, I am prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the others to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Janchura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and false arguments about regional rail transport, says Haszek.
Janchura has already reported last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertising that will mention the unfavourable approaches of the regions.
He told Radiojrnal that he had interrupted the campaign after Christmas and that he was counting on to resume it after the New Year.
He pointed out that the campaign would target corruption in the broad sense.
Janchura started its campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways to the operation of railway connections for a order of approximately 150 billion crowns, without making calls for tenders.
According to Janchura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to threats from a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I don't know who he is but I won't say his name, Janchura said today in Radiojrnal.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free of charge and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will reverse the old habits as of January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voting is already taking place, saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals culminate.
The pharmaceutical institute has already defined for vaccines the maximum prices that will be paid for sickness insurance.
Experts also see clearly in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated for free against pneumonia.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If vaccination started last year or earlier, the following vaccinations will have to be paid by themselves.
The first dose of the vaccine should be administered between the third and fifth months of the child.
Last year, about a quarter of the families volunteered to immunize their children against the pneumococcals.
However, the parents paid 1600 crowns or more for a dose.
The vaccination of younger people requires four doses.
Experts estimate that every year, sickness insurance costs 300 to 450,000 crowns at vaccine doses.
However, they save on medical care that unvaccinated children would need.
So far, the State has spent about 500,000 crowns a year for the entire vaccination of children.
The refunded vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococcals are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also of serious infections including inflammation of the intestines and poisoning of the blood.
According to hospital investigations, up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age were caused by pneumonia.
Apart from the Czech Republic, some 40 other countries have introduced the reimbursed vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on any future vaccination obligation.
From January, it must be regulated by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský Association indicated that mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted the vaccination against pneumococcals.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied that we had an optional vaccination.
That's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I think it's a direction that we need to follow now, said Kalovski.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination process against pneumococcals.
We are not considering it at all for the moment, he said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršenj.
Optional vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Paediatric Society, recognizes that a voluntary vaccination based on its defects.
However, if all children were vaccinated, a reduction in vaccination renewals could be considered "In the situation where the vaccine costs such an amount I understand the decision making the optional vaccination" said Cabrnochová.
Experts predict that as of next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have to immunize their babies.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also broken by the fact that it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not by the State.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should release funds for prevention, thus saving on future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products
However, this is linked to the concerns of the practitioners, who are involved in the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to buy vaccines by insurance, doctors receiving them in the same way as the other vaccine products provided by the State.
However, some Members feared that this would allow insurance to "deduct the amounts of sickness insurance".
For example, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to be refunded.
According to estimates, pediatricians will have to invest, on an individual basis, nearly 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is an important amount.
It'll be far from easy, according to Cabrnoch.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Vol de muse"
Frank Frazetta's son, a recognized illustrator, was accused of trying to steal tables for a value of $20 million (GBP 12 million) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, the police reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been intercepted while loading 90 plates in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical skin to force the entrance of the museum to the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, aged 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan le Barbare and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the Associated Press Agency (AP).
AP quoted a police officer as saying that young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family quarrel.
According to a police statement, Mr. Frazetta Jr, 52 years old, claims to have been authorized by his father to "enter the museum by any means to carry the tables in a storage facility", the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior refused to grant such authorization, the agency said.
Labour advocates an increase in budgetary tax.
Ministers have defended the increase in the tax and reductions in the expenditure announced in the pre-Budget report, despite the criticisms of the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Tories stated that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that it was serious about the reduction of the deficit by deferring its decisions until the elections.
The Chancellor was also attracted to the fumes by attacking low wages and middle wages.
Among its main proposals are an increase of 0.5% of Social Insurance and a 1% ceiling on public wages from 2011.
The Anger of Social Insurance
The trade unions protested that low wages were penalized by a recession that they were not responsible and warned that "problems" were being announced.
The reduction in social insurance - which will achieve around GBP 3 billion a year - has caused the world of companies to become angry, because it considers it a tax on jobs while the goal should be a resumption of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than 20,000 GBP a year, will reach about 10 million workers.
PRINCIPAL POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social insurance will still increase by 0.5% as of April 2011
The economy will drop even more than 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on bank bonds
Increased tax on the profits of small companies has been abandoned
Discounts of electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in retirement by 2.5 per cent
According to Treasury estimates, a person who wins 30,000 GBP will lose 90 GBP per year and a person who wins 40,000 GBP will lose 190 GBP, while a person who wins 10,000 GBP per year will gain 110 GBP.
The Ministers stated that their goal of reducing the deficit by half before 2013 was "hard decisions" but stressed that 60% of the additional tax burden would be charged on the first 5% of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Secretary of the Treasury, rejected an increase in the tax and stressed that a decrease in expenditure was a "water drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important; they will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely essential in the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said that he was confident and that economic growth would begin at the end of the year.
However, Labour forecasts on economic growth - which will influence the amount it will need to borrow and the speed at which the deficit will be completed - have been questioned after the Chancellor has been forced to revise its first figures.
In his speech, he stated that the economy would probably decrease by 4.75% this year - much worse than the decline of 3.5% predicted in April - while the loan would be 3 billion GDP above the preliminary estimate.
"Failure of opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch this Thursday a new advertising campaign warning against the "debt crisis" of the Labour, stated that the project to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, added, "kinically" against difficult choices until the elections - which are due to take place in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, chief secretary at the Treasury of the Fantoma Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
" The important announcements will be made after the elections, whatever the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Force stresses that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from further reductions, contrary to Tory's proposals, which would result in a faster and more significant reduction in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems claimed that the money collected by increasing taxes and reducing expenditure would be used to support the expenditures of next year and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were "constructed on the wind".
Nick Robinson, the BBC's political editor, said that the schedule of announcements - such as the increase in inflation for some disability benefits in April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor in the face of propaganda charges, and the money just recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Force stresses that additional assistance is being provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although the ministers had not published the expenditure details beyond 2011, economists stated that it was clear that the public expenditure restrictions would not begin to be felt only in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institut des Estudes Fiscales) stated that the number of Chancellors involved substantial reductions in many areas in the future, including transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually only reported," said his Director Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner," said Roger Bootle, Economic Adviser to Deloitte's accountants.
"This has been a false pre-budget report.
The FBI investigates "U.S. arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters, suspected of extremist links.
Men were arrested during a raid in a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab , the US Embassy announced in Pakistan, the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether it was the same men who had been declared missing from their home in the United States of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information on these persons.
Three of them are presented as Pakistani descent, one Egyptian inheritance and the other Yemenite origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what charges are against them and under what conditions they are detained," said Ian Kelly, spokesperson.
Katherine Schweit, spokesperson for the FBI, stated that the agency had been aware of the arrests and that it was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and nature of their activities there, and if they are really the students who are missing," she said.
Pakistan's Embassy in Washington claimed that men had been arrested in a house owned by one of them's uncles.
She said that the house was already being monitored by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the men arrested.
The Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused any comment on the arrests, reported the Reuters press agency, but stated that the United States should "cooperate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the continuing infrastructure of terrorism to recruit and train people".
The five students had been taken away from their home by their families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuse"
Over the past twenty years, human rights have been as little respected as ever, according to the Amnesty International Association report.
the report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the June presidential election campaign.
One man quoted in the report claimed that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another stated that he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticisms about its non-compliance with human rights.
The authorities have argued that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran, after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election led to the largest public demonstrations since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
Dozens were sentenced to prison sentences and prosecutors claimed that at least five people had been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, a member of the BBC in Tehran, now in London, claims that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, our correspondent said.
"False confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ibrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of 'Working with Facebook networks' and protesting the election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still in blood and half conscious, said Amnesty.
In August, the missing candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that demonstrators detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities rejected the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuse had taken place.
Amnesty also quoted the case of a former prisoner who said he had been locked in a container with 75 other persons, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial system set up a committee to investigate post-election disorders and the Government's response, but stated that the mandate and powers of these agencies were not clear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski trails built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to turn Bristol's site into a competition track.
The Piste in the Park event (One track in the park) attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders in competition for cash prizes.
At the top of Brandon Hill Park track, a small trampline was ahead of a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that the view of the top of the track was magnificent but that it was quite terrifying.
It's a magnificent view, with all the lights of the city shimmering in contrabas.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents," he added.
Prices have rewarded the best volts - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be left at the fountain.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French don't like the crowd" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
The last book by Mr Bowen presents a much broader and more ambitious picture.
Good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in the mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what M. Bozen calls "Muslim space" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He knows very well how to listen to and reproduce discussions between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the womb (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use a banking system based on interests to obtain a loan?
These are practical problems, he says, which are the everyday lot rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern lay society.
They do not lead the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr Bowen are generally in agreement with their lawyers from a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia who are today a small part of the Muslims in Europe.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of the Muslims and the laity of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered how French politicians (and the guardian intellectual elite so virulent of laity) were actually engaged in pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not tortured, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than increasing pragmatism, it detects a "treity of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, we are tempted to say, "Yes, but not yet."
The darkest view of the world
The Arctic changes faster and dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is sinking at an alarming speed, carrying with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing are in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their village.
In "On a thin ice layer", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the great north, polar bear.
Aware of the history and complicated policies of whale fishing, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves by chasing white bears.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then brave yearning for 14 years who had not to fight that the point of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, captured while swimming beside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are always a millionth of the surface needed for an adult in freedom.The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to the things that were growing in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis related the stories of other writers and historians and often referred to the threat that hunters posed to the survival of species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit Indians in motoski use powerful rifles to chase their gear.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two nations of hunting that ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and dissipating summary of Arctic science and a glimpse of what the future might be there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmosphericists nor oceanographers can accurately relate the rate of change.
You don't have to try.
At the end of the 19th and early 20th, Fridtjof Nansen's pioneering trips provided the first information on the source of the ice-cold.
The submarines of the cold war then mapped the change of relief under it.
Satellite surveillance and iceberg probes are of great help, but the biggest work is done by hard men, campaigning in the cold.
Mr. Anderson looked at the extraordinary and small world of the Arctic ice tax system, formed by the seabeds of saltwater pressed by freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, planned between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, maybe it'll be our turn."
Of the 6,000 people who deposited crowns on the graves in Arlington
The first class of Angelo Robinson, 19 years old, took a seven-hour bus trip to deposit a simple crown on a soldier's grave that he had never met.
For him and for the other Marines who made the trip to Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina at the Cimetière Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who once were in their place.
Within a few months, from where we were sent, we risk being in their place, said Robinson about the soldiers who fell.
If that happened to me, I'd like someone to do the same for me, that's why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers gathered on Saturday morning to present crowns on the graves of the veterans, in different sections of the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
In 1992, Morrisll Worcester, owner of Worcester Wraith Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and other people decided to decorate several hundred graves in the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make each year the trip, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters have also founded a non-profit association, Wraiths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of the Arlington cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site for the victims of the flight 93 of United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation provided more than $150 000 to purchase and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old from Westminster, said she had traveled to Arlington in honor of her husband, a retired career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way to thank those who had sacrificed themselves.
It's a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Emitouflée in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between the palm trees and the extended hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers chose ancient graves, dating from World War I and World War II, as well as the Vietnam War, because they were not as often visited as the new graves, the organizers said.
Humour was optimistic, while the children played and the couples held hands, carrying the cool pin crowns on the gray graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red papillo knot on top.
Nearly there was silence in Section 60, where most war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan were inhaled.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the dark mood of the current wars began to fill the area.
Individuals would cry without hiding, other prayers and families and friends would be sustained in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others were looking to see the small black and white information cards, buried in the wet soil for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in tears on his son's grave.
She is part of Zanesfield, Ohio and had spent eight hours coming to gather on the grave of Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, dead in July.
Nobody should ever forget about what we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"For a long time after I've disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
A U.S. citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested an American citizen who distributed mobile phones and portable computers in the country, claimed the services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The citizen, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana try to have access to the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested under the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writing, entail the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are married and are followed and harassed by government officials.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards, but his authorizations have always been refused.
The detention of an American citizen may increase tensions between the Communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration that pursues a "sweet" approach to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government move forward by concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, so that the United States can do the same.
Mobile phones and portable computers are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country or the average salary of a staff member is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a payday.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to connect often have to communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the Americans incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, according to Gloria Berbena, a press release to the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide any more information on the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- to distribute mobile phones free of charge -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the American Human Rights Watch Group, who recently published a serious report on the freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to Raul Castro's installation as the country's leader to replace Fidel, his sick older brother.
According to Vivanco, a defendant is often arrested, tried and imprisoned the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often reacted negatively to the United States, when the two countries started a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities recruited an organization supposed to prepare a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, hoping that this case would lead to an important network of recruits of terrorists who run the Internet to search for young radicalized men.
The investigators claimed that they were chasing a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after having discovered them when one of them made comments approving terrorist waves on the YouTube video website.
Upon arriving in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them join the retreated region of Pakistan's tribal belt, al-Qaida home and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistani secret services who was informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince the commanders of al-Qaida that these men were not participating in the CIA conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Thus, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the prohibited mountains of the north-east became a refuge for terrorism.
They were considered to be infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who expressed itself on the condition of keeping the anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities said that men were determined and that they were always trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to gain entry into the al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are interrogated by the FBI -- emphasizes the crucial role of recruits in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more importantly, in determining the people in whom they trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, US secret services have been given priority to infiltrating men into the al-Qaida network.
The organization's recruits play the role of barriers, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may become spies.
According to analysts, potential American recruits are studied closely by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups also need to increase their attention, in recent years in the choice of persons they accept because US secret services have become experts in terms of their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow his recruitment model than so many others have already followed?
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen demand a "action" for the climate
Tens of thousands of protesters walked in the streets here on Saturday, demanding more action on the climate of the negotiators working in the palace of the Bella Convention Center of the City.
The number of protesters was estimated to be 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists have lit up some explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
On the day that little has happened during United Nations-sponsored climate discussions, thousands of activists went from town to city, deploying billboards in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish, declaring 'The Earth says it has enough.'
Several celebrities joined the protests, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said to travel to his mother's country of birth, Peru, opened her eyes to the problems that she must face because of the impact of climate change that is already taking place."
This is one of the reasons why I have decided to join in the big move -- to make the word go through and call the world's leaders to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said that she had arrested 19 people for wearing a mask or having pocket knives.
The police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said that she had arrested 19 people for wearing a mask or having pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to keep the anonymity because of its involvement in climate discussions, activists who wore black masks and clothing lit several explosives near the main Copenhagen channel, which is surrounded by several ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first of all rockets, followed by "some major explosions".
Inside the Palace of Congress, people were gathered around television screens to follow the walk, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters failed to raise the awareness of key authorities such as Su Wei, a representative of China for the climate.
When asked if he thought that an event would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English "In fact, it was something I did not know.
He then continued in Mandarin, declaring, "The event is important, I cannot hear what is going on outside."
He noted that the walk might seem harmful or useful from the perspectives.
It shows the interest of the general public and of the various sectors on climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others."
The results of the tests reveal differences between races
Last week's federal report on mathematical results brought good news to the public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the District is still far behind the headquarters, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are far more progress in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of Education Progress) are the persistent gap between the results of African-Americans and whites, on both local and national levels.
The average results of grade 4 white children (cm1) in WashingtonD.C. have increased, in the last two years, from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but those of their Afro-American classmates have increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap in success has indeed increased between 2007 and 2009, ranging from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the Afro-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, with only one point, from 245 to 244.
The mean result of the blanks was not included in the test results as the sample was not sufficiently important.
The overall view over a period of six years is no longer encouraging.
In 2003, the difference between Grade 4 black and white (cm1), when the first NAEP report of the District was published, was 60 points (262-202).
Although the results of children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has only decreased to 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the increase celebrated by the Director of the Teaching Group of Michelle A. Rhee and the Maire, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were driven by white students who were already good.
This would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality in the education of the District.
I do not miss any joy for one or two points won, said Kwame R. Brown (democratic apartment), Member of the D.C. Council and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary ( Elementary School).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said the message of test results is that the city's middle schools (colleges) desperately need attention.
Indeed, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect them.
But what scares us is that we don't spend enough time and energy on our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This autumn, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at schools in the end of the elementary cycle and early college that did not incorporate the basics of reading earlier in their school course and are rather late for their friends.
Each day, the program of mathematics, for the classes of Kindergarten (Maternal) at Grade 6 (6th) focuses on real life games and experiences, as they were established in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who should also be credited for the progress of NAEP reported last week.
I just think that we need to continue working to offer better interventions to these students at a lower level than that of the class, Rhee said.
Others believe that the results of NAEP raise the question whether Rhee can continue to raise the system's overall results while providing the money and resources for schools with less good results to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher at the University of Berkeley in California who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional policy solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest districts of Washington.
This target can also have political implications that generate this important programme.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other Superintendents of schools, she tries to serve as the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a good school system.
We need to strengthen our district schools so that all families, wherever they come from, will be assured that their children will be able to obtain excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week that one of the key elements in reducing the gap in success was the time of the traditional public school, today 180 days in the Washington District, to compete with the Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year to get 185 days, that it considers a "start point" to get another increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise for the future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long sip.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, descends and climbs a moment of eyes to the white columns, brick façades and greening hair.
Graciela's parents could only finish the high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other grade 8 (4th) students from the group explored Gettysburg where the school fees were $38,690 a year, her attitude was less than that of a new student impressed than a enthusiast.
That's where I'm going to study! Graciela exclaimed who would like to study medicine, while the guide directed them to the entrance of the science building.
You, really? says she's dreaming, when she's told the low ratio of law professor - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh to visit children during their three-day discovery trip and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to university:
The question is where.
Although this issue is still widespread for the large number of American children born to Spanish immigrant parents who have left high school where they have become parents at adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands of students who will be allowed to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a hispanic of the "second generation" over five years of his studies at high school -- a remarkable success if it is considered that so many of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, have entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, researchers say, they open the way to the next generations that will play an important role in the country's work.
Researchers who study batants claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an inherent need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach the university -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who have no experience and skills to help them navigate in the system, at any time, no intervention will help them, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a network of support to these children, from the maternal to the high school.
The federal program that funded the visit of Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (preparations to you), it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize university preparation programs that start when students from low-income families are in middle school (school) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the programme has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent entering the university, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
The Ministry of Iraqi Oil gets agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has succeeded in attracting important oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two procurements that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies in China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of the oil industry in Iraq, which has been disabled by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies are divided into only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second survey that started on Friday.
The only one who had made a bid has lost.
Two U.S. companies have obtained contracts for field procurements in June.
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, they are Asian and European companies that open the way, Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum Forum, said a website for information on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by mass-coordinated bombings, Tuesday, and political instability while American military troops retreated, stopped American oil companies, preventing them from becoming more forceful in Iraq, which has the third largest crude oil reserve in the world, analysts say.
American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivers, in particular Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose labour costs were significantly lower and were more likely to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhilips, who have maintained strong ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and have provided it with their technical advice, have distributed empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., held by the State, entered into more contracts than other companies and was awarded with important participation in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesperson for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be equal to its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
The companies selected to submit tenders made offers that were then compared to the rate per barium that the department agreed to pay to justify production above the current levels for each field.
One of the major organizers of al-Qaida would have been killed in Pakistan
It seems that an American missile, having hit the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida operations this week, declared on Friday US anti-spionage authorities.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second murder attack against one of the terrorist leaders this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car on Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities claimed that the missiles had been fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA within the anarchic tribal border of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of Pakistani civil secret services, speaking on the Miran Shah's phone.
The authorities said that the suspects' local militants rushed on the spot and quickly confiscated what remained of the "totally dejected bodies".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two anti-terrorism representatives of the United States provided unspecified evidence that Somalia was part of the dead.
Somalia was described as one of the responsible al-Qaida military organizers who led the terrorist operations of the group outside Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities who wished to keep the anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes within Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic instructions of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the US authority said that Somalia had made rapid progress in the al-Qaida's ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to the great American public, but this does not reduce the threat he poses to us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death was confirmed, Somalia would be the second major character of al-Qaida or the second leader of the Taliban killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has decreased since summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to the figures advanced by the Long War Journal, a web site moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability, while also disproportionately killing suspected informants, the site states.
UN special envoy to Kabul withdraws
The UN special envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he was going to resign from his post in March, at the end of a turbulent mandate with widespread allegations of corruption during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
Eide's departure takes place when Obama has decided to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations envoy said that he supported this increase but expressed concern about the United States calendar for the withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and that would force other Governments of NATO to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the good signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a Kabul phone interview.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international officials supporting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide stated that he did not resign, but that he would simply comply with the commitment he had made to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement," Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to United Nations representatives, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
The representatives claim that the name of Staffan di Mistura has been quoted; it is a citizen of Italo-Switzerland who recently presided over a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and of disclosing evidence of a massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but he stated that Galbraith's accusations -- which were thanked -- "have caused damage to the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism in respect of international election observation".
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief of the United States forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted with the United Nations Responsibilities on allowing his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries that he was not assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in how their money was spent.
Eide expressed her frustration about the limits of her powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy United Nations recruitment regulations were losing its ability to bring new talents.
The rules of the United Nations are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must be subject to additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defence, Robert M. Gates, said Friday that the major world powers were about to impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of his inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a 300-military strike in northern Iraq, during a week's visit to the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramaticized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of such a delay.
One of the things that weighs most on me is that if I learned something in Iraq over the last six years, it's the unpredictable side of the war.
The Obama administration considered a set of sanctions aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians on the street.
He said that "a set of motivations and punishments" might be necessary to convince the Iranian government that it would be in fact less safe with nuclear weapons" because "his people would suffer enormously" from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by House Blanche, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probably" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
In Geneva's talks on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on reducing his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon an important part of his rich uranium storage, in exchange for fuel desperately necessary for a medical research reactor.
The administration has promoted such an agreement, by developing confidence on both sides and by making time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran has appeared to have turned away from attempts to agree - in part, the experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided by whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my opinion, Iran's redundancy against some of the proposals of the international community for which they had actually agreed at the beginning of October has moved the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join what they did not consider, in the course of further major sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set 31 December as a deadline for Iran to respond to proposals, before he turned to other options, including the continuation of what the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions".
In a statement made yesterday in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations called "unfounded allegations" of some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and stated that it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who had to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before taking the plane for the rich oil region of Kurdish to meet with the troop leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
There are ongoing tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid all delays in US troops reduction plans, from 115,000 to 50,000 before the end of August.
Gates also wants to ease Kurd's anxiety about the suspension. US authorities have quoted Gates from Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy in a unified Iraq".
We will not abandon you."
In ageing China, a change in direction
Wang Weijia and her husband were surrounded by propaganda shows, saying, "The Earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "An extra baby, it's an extra grave."
They learned so well that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate of their city and the ageing population, radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instant and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We have no second left, Wang said, 31 years old, Director of Human Resources and has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single child's policy in China, creating two generations of unique children with well-known games and jokes, named "the emperor's little ones", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell by 1.8 children per couple compared to six when policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents aged 60 years and over is expected to explode, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This figure is well above the global average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in the rich coastal cities with a very educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds accounted for nearly 22 per cent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Shanghai Municipal Population Commission and Family Planning) stated that fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent a lack of work in the future".
Shanghai is about to become "so old - but not as rich, however - that developed countries such as Japan and Sweden" she said.
A gradual slowdown
As drafted in the Constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of the only child is, to date, unquestionably, the most controversial obligation introduced by the Communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay enormous fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and suffer discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have assigned the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuse in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some authorities forced pregnant women from a second child to be abortioned.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to a ratio of boys - girls abnormally high.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually adjusted their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for residents of cities, members of ethnic minorities and the cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they adopted many of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research, at Beijing University, said that the central government authorities recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of detailed regulations that had the right to have a second child and how to apply for authorization.
The city's government has launched family planning and volunteers to meet couples at their home, and to slide prospectors at their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those wishing to have more than one child.
According to the family planning manager, the response was disappointing.
Disappointmental response
Although those in charge of a rural town in Shanghai banlieu said that they saw an increase in requests for couples seeking a second child after the campaign was launched, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, always receives only four to five applications per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, claim that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be about 165,000 -- slightly more than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in the municipality of Caolu de Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don't want to have any more children.
They want to have their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, stated that they would love two children and that they are legally authorized there.
But like many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and the life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The West consider the policy of the only child to be a problem of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant for seven months from the first child of the couple.
True, we're stealing the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Manager, said she only wanted a single child because she was one of her own. "We were the family center and we used to be used to everyone taking care of us."
We don't have the habit of taking care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company, said this more carefully.
For couples working at two, middle-class, who lower the birth rate, he said, it must be selfish to succeed.
People aged 20 or 30 grew up seeing their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and do not want to have this lifestyle themselves, he said.
Even one child asks a lot of time for his parents, he says.
A mother must leave at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child has only 9 months, you need to write his CV to get a place in the best maternity."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has plans for emission reduction
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations -- which has so far been characterized by unorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- came under the light of the Friday ramp, as a result of the publication of a document highlighting ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialised nations with most of the burden, in the next few years.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases highlighted the remaining obstacles, as long as it clarified the path to take.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that lack time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Written by a United Nations special working group, the text does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor to support climate, current and long-term warming.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how new developed economies and emerging economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the increase in global temperature that the leaders would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequiyt, Representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the Executive Secretary of the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, described as "full image".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020 from 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries, during the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union has also resumed negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to sustain floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal alterations have occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, representative of the United States of America for climate negotiations, rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialised countries, compared with voluntary efforts by major emerging economies, if these were not financed by developed countries.
This change is the signal that Obama's administration became harder to China than Bush's administration was, two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of the major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not insist on ensuring that reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments one hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, He Yafei said that the US chief negotiator, either lacking "good sense", was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not help China financially to combat climate warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, both in the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States competing for their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said that it was not surprising that the main powers were fighting to know who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major issuers responsible for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, Ulate said, which is also the Climate Adviser for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries were more vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to put pressure on a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants said that negotiations would lead to a minimum political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, drafted a 24-page treaty proposal, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of the European Commission's Climate Unit, said that the action of small island States "has put a political pressure on the complete political process", in part because they are now unified and ask emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The debate became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the problems in the forum before the heads of government reached agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Minister of the Environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister of the Environment were off their plane and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend house-to-house meetings and briefings, in order to be able to make claims that will be studied during the following week.
The true image of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people enter and leave the Palace of Congress every day -- guitar players present night performances that mock, betray, and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by e-mails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity only increases: almost all important ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We enter the Grand Court, Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of the World Conservation Policy, said.
Heavy weights are coming.
In Britain, the first 225 km/h train will redefine Monday’s syndrome
At 5h13 on Monday morning, a sifflet blow will be lost at night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed train in the country will reach 225 km/h, while along Ashford, in Kent, London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin train outside London.
He hopes that the new service will enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and will link the major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland in London.
The small holes lost will become thriving cities, the duration of business trips will be much less long, and the passage of the plane and the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhered to this project.
But the ten billion books needed to build a new iron network, the inevitable planning battle and the fear of danger to the environment can slow down the British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will report its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the next stage route planned for the high-speed network.
The new London-based line in the West Midlands will be drawn in the five metres of the urban area and sites where environmental impact may be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be designed up to 25 metres from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 has three options for a high-speed network going north.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The privileged options are put forward in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will be separated in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch going west of the Pennines in Manchester and Scotland and another going north-east, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best performance option," said a rail professional.
When it is finished, the time to travel between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a one-hour journey at the moment.
The proposals will allow the train to travel to 400km/h, making the British network the fastest in the world.
The initial track is designed to allow 400m long trains and can transport 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be enlarged to receive the high-speed network.
The experts in the rail industry said that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this opportunity.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be put in place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if the machine is launched, the network will have to be built part by part.
The trains will first be forced to travel off high-speed lines on the trains in North Birmingham, preserving travel time between London and Scotland for up to three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure a train passage, which is a reference point for the rail revolution.
The taxpayers refund the GBP 75,000 loan for the Tory Orange
Alan Duncan, the main member of the Tory Parliament, paid the taxpayer thousands of books a year to reimburse the cost of an orange that he built in his home of his constituency.
The party's responsibility that David Cameron has been retrograded to complain that the members of the parliament were "maintenu", increased his loan of GBP 75,000 to build a Chinese extension to his second house in Rutland.
It had been authorized to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of books per month, to the taxpayer.
The authorities of the Commons received complaints at that time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Läg, who carried out an inspection of the members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan said the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of the parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village of Rutland - Melton.
The surrounding houses were sold for nearly a million books.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the office said that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange.
The neighbors describe it as a "veranta for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to explain for the increase in loans during a recent investigation by the Committee on Commons' Privileges and Standards on its prior loan arrangements.
The Committee sentenced him last month for any allegations of non-compliance with the rules, following an investigation into his expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan amended the legal security of his London ownership of GBP 271,406 in the house of his constituency which he purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a member of the parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed approximately 1,400 GBP per month of interest on loans until March of last year.
In April, its applications increased by more than 1,800 GBP per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the loan of GBP 75,000.
The standard interest rate variable RBS rose from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, without moving since then.
The last publication of the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for GBP 1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as Head of the ghost cabinet in September, after a reporter under cover filmed it saying that members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the scandal of spending.
"In fact, it's national now, you have to live "on the budget" and you've been treated as "from the m... and"
He said: "I spent my money on my garden and I asked for a small part, based on what was right.
And I could have asked for more, but I didn't."
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire since his former post as a oil negotiator, began to explain his expenditures in May, after it appeared that he had asked for thousands of books for his garden, before agreeing with the office of charges that this could "be considered excessive".
An activist raised a £ hole in M Duncan's hair to protest after it was revealed that he had requested £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in the loan, last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements, both approved by the office of charges and then by Legge."
He added: "There is no problem of decommissioning or processing or use of the rules or whatever.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It couldn't be more clear or simpler."
Faithful, come all to Brighton's Advent calendar
Brighton's beach cabins have found a new way of promoting for the winter months, an interactive adventure calendar.
Beyond, a group of the alternative church that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabins for every December day, using Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on December 1, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., every day, with pasta and hot wine served for free.
The Christmas songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, an assistant TV marketing assistant at Hove, is an unpaid priest of the diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a church, why do we expect people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should approach people and celebrate more captivatingly.
"The idea of the Avent calendar of the beach cabin came just after a conversation with some friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experience and represent it through spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world for the climate
Tens of thousands of people have protested on Saturday to seek an ambitious and binding agreement on combating climate warming throughout the world and in Copenhagen, where police have carried out hundreds of interrogations.
At least 30 thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands according to organizers, showed in the cold in the Danish capital, on the side of the United Nations Conference on Climate, which was scheduled to enter into an agreement on Friday, 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilization of climate across the world, illustrated by these events, has contributed to making a very high failure "the political price" in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the start of the yard, when a group of 300 demonstrators, fully dressed in black, broke windows with paws and hammers, an AFP journalist observed.
Anti-emergent police officers were immediately involved without a home.
In total, the police announced the imprisonment of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to the members of the Black Blocs, these ultraviolent groups, which were illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were called "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were always held in the street on Saturday night "menetized and maintained in position despite extreme cold".
Part of Parliament, the court, rather than a good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, the negotiating site.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building, without trying to enter.
A scene had been prepared to welcome the scheduled speakers, before a guard to the candelabra with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cap, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters had come in because of the large cities of Europe, but many Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in waterproof blue sky, had formed a first meeting in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Earth's Friends, who intended to form "blue marriage" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we go down the streets to ask for environmental debt repair for the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't continue to say: we have time, we've appreciated the beníno singer Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry in Africa, watercourses where we can walk like we never did before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the alternativeist movement has approached environmental organizations.
The French MP José Bové, a figure of internationalism, explained that he had come to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no conflict between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which covers many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had given the signal to be sent.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, had gone down the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, students for most of the time, were shown in red, banging bands of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, meetings of several hundred protesters were also held to demand an energetic action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered a few hundred people, including Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
Abkhazia separatist elected its president, Georgia denouncing a "farce"
Abkhazie elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow's recognition of Georgia's pro-Russian separatist region, while Tbilisi denounced a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were invited to participate in this first ballot after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 for the control of the South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 1700 GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before the closure, according to the members of the Abkhhaze Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on Saturday night to Sunday.
The five high-level candidates, including the outgoing President, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the ballot.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakhvili, "regrete that Abkhazia is under the total occupation of Russia", said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considered it a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After being separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which caused several thousand deaths, Abkhazia seeks to demonstrate through this election that she is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, has told the AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claimed to have voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the electors who went to the polling station in a school in Soukhumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with some palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidency in this region in the rainy landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Mr. Bagapch next to the President and Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are installed in this small area of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, has reserved a warm welcome for Russian officials to monitor the conduct of the poll.
We, the people of Abkhazia, are grateful, during a small ceremony, in allusion to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, replied by raising a vodka glass.
On the other hand, the opposition represented by former vice-president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticises the agreements with Moscow last year, like the one that gave Russia control over the railways abkhhazes for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims not to support the current power or opposition.
A 50% more one vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second tour must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: World events, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people went to the world on Saturday to seek an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the one hand, questioned nearly 700 people in the margins of an impressive demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to organizers, showed in the cold the afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, in search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Parliament's side, the courts, the overall good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, where negotiations take place.
The demonstrators stopped at about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A scene had been prepared to welcome the scheduled speakers, before a guard to the candelabra with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cap, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the start of the court, a group of several hundred demonstrators, fully dressed in black, munitions of brick and hammers, broke windows, found an AFP journalist.
Anti-emergent police officers immediately surrounded them and intervened without a home, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the imprisonment of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the Black Blocs, these ultraviolent groups, which were illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was wounded to death by a gunshot and four cars fired near a squad during incidents that led to the arrest of 20 people, according to the police.
We saw the extremist groups, had prevented the police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the forces of the order towered in the sky.
The majority of the protesters, who came in the car and in the big cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in waterproof blue sky, had formed a first meeting in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Earth's Friends, who intended to form "blue marriage" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we go down the streets to ask for environmental debt repair for the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't continue to say: we have time, we've appreciated the beníno singer Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry in Africa, there are watercourses where we can walk when we've never done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the alternativeist movement has approached environmental organizations.
The French MP José Bové, a figure of internationalism, told the AFP to come to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no conflict between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Oxfam organization mobilized several personalities, including the Danish Mannequin Helena Christensen, the former United Nations Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who was to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which covers many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had given the signal to be sent.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, had gone down the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, students for most of the time, showed, dressed in red, and treed bandanas with solar energy in front of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, meetings of several hundred protesters were also held to demand action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered a few hundred people, including Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
The geo-history is strengthened by the reform of the general lycee, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to appear in the JDD Sunday that history and geography were "strengthened" by the reform of the general school, despite the abolition of their compulsory teaching in scientific terminal.
Now the first students will have every four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Mr. Chatel.
For the Minister, "you have to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the line S is no longer a scientific thread" but "in large, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L branches cannot remain branches of the S, he continues: "I have not heard a lot of historians and intellectuals get angry about the absence of the history in terminal in technological lycees."
On Saturday, an Ifop survey published in Humanity revealed that nearly seven French out of ten (69%) rejected the government's project to delete the mandatory teaching of the history and geography in Terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers have also criticised this deletion, as well as the left and certain right-elections.
On the other hand, the Minister added that it was not "no question" to delete the philosophy of the S terminal program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a Tuesday mobilization day to protest against the project, which they considered sacrificed the teaching training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass an eligibility test at the beginning of the year that will cover their discipline, and then at the end of the year an admission test that will cover their teaching ability, the Minister explained.
In addition, they will follow courses in situations during the year of M2 and will be a first year in front of students as trainees.
If you add all the courses proposed before the competition, you will already get more presence before the students, or more than 300 hours, has it continued.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
It also reaffirms the project to delete the school card "from 2012".
A Normal Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince you about the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about issues of the Copenhagen Summit: it is the challenge that was raised on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Development (GIEC) invited by the Higher Normal School of Ulm Street.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Peace Prize, opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of an interview of experts, 15 minutes each, filmed and open to the public, a journalist from the AFP.
We wanted to do something that captures people and gives them a desire to know more about it, explained in the margins of the Edouard Hanneso conference, 22 years old, one of the organizers of this day who draws his name from the one given by the students to the fish at the school pool.
Twenty participants are selected from among the experts in their discipline and selected for their charismatic side, has it been specified.
Regarding climate heating, "you can talk about hours, but you can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who expressed himself without notes, but with the help of graphics, in front of fifty people.
This is part of our role as scientist, he stressed, hoping that the audiences will believe that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
Videos drawn from these conferences will be posted on the school's website from December 15.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled in February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delays of payments: anger of prison guards, planned actions
The prison supervisors called on Friday to "general immobilization" to demand the payment by the end of the year of the additional premiums and hours for which payment was made in January for budgetary reasons.
FO penitentiary (2nd Supervisory Union) asked staff who would not be in service to appear in front of and "block" prisons on Tuesday morning to "denominate the flight of their dus".
The CGT penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls them "to meet in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization", judging as "great and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "additional hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first supervisory union, the federal autonomous penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger".
The Department of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that the additional hours have increased significantly in 2009 and have not all been budgeted, but ensure that the remainder will be paid in January.
The Chancellor stated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent an e-mail to the supervisors' unions to ensure that this payment would be made next month.
I do not ignore the efforts made by staff to operate and modernise our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I asked the management of the prison administration to put in place a set of measures without delay to ensure that this situation, which is the result of a poor assessment of the number of additional hours, does not reproduce in the future, Mrs Alliot-Marie added.
The December pay will therefore be greater, except for management staff who receive the famed privileges and objectives, has deplored Ufap/Unsa, for which "budgetary constraints have a good back".
It is a pure scandal, the interregional association FO of Marseilles has become angry, announcing its decision to boycott up to the new order "all meetings and assemblies".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regularized in December, the ideal for extra hours, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when our tasks and missions are increased without increasing our staff, it is more than regretful to take advantage of the staff's cash, he believes the CGT penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less bad lots than others.
But in any case the account is not there, the secretary-general of Ufap, Jean-François Forget, noted.
For Christmas, Obama says to offer "luckier tricks" than those he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas family at the White House, has entrusted the "father" of the small Oprah Winfrey screen with a simple gift rule: "I give things better than the things I receive."
As part of a special show that will be broadcast on Sunday night on the ABC channel, the president and his wife, Michelle, offer an overview of how they intend to celebrate the end of the year in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged partner of the family will be on the side.
Father Noël also loves Bo, so said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would "surely" have a gift, according to the extracts of the issue released in advance.
And Michelle Obama made a mistake against her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts he received: "Of course not, I offered you some nice gifts last year," she touched the president.
Is it absolutely necessary to give up before humour by showing the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who offered you this?".
During this broadcast of an hour, in the relaxed atmosphere, with the famous animator who was a firm supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama referred to a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his father kenyan had rarely seen offered him in Christmas.
I remember this time I met my father coming to see us for Christmas and he gave me a basketball, said the president.
It's only a long time ago in my life that I realized it was him who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her doll house.
I didn't really know how to organize a house, so I aligned all the furniture against the wall rather than set them around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reworked, RTL claims he is in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was reoperated in Los Angeles due to significant "healings" after an operation in France, but the situation is "his control" according to his surroundings, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was reoperated on Wednesday night to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors had found "silence resulting from the operation" of the discale hernie in Paris on 26 November, reported to Paris his press service, stating that these injuries had "needed a repair operation".
The singer's press service, however, wanted to reassure itself that the situation was "controlled", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be communicated no later than 48 hours.
According to the RTL, partner of the last singer tour, however, Johnny Hallyday would have been thrown into an artificial coma to avoid "pangs and complications".
It's only in 48 hours that we'll have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opens his eye, adds RTL.
Questioned by the AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to certain sources" no drain would have been placed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of the Monceau Park for this discal hernie.
The intervention, programmed for several days, was practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajouux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
This was not available on Thursday night to comment on RTL information.
Following his surgery on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized on Monday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles for a subsequent intervention infection.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, estimated Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but made sure he didn't "no interest" in the rocker, which is "a fighter".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was a connery because 12 hours after that operation, it's not playable, Eddy Mitchell said.
Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to reassure himself, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "reduced".
Mr. Camus had also said that he had been involved with Laeicia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the health concerns of the singer have only increased since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, in general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been operated with a "small colon cancer", then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer repeated his "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been well-recorded. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the singer to move on stage.
In mid-November, his surroundings even had to neglect a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small bassin: the first of Bousquet on its fetic distance
French Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalized at the World 2009 in large bass, announced on Thursday an international title on a particularly long distance, the 50 m free swim, during the Euro2009 in small bass in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are allowed for the last time has seen only three records of the world beatus while waiting for a disparagement.
One has been improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 knots and the other two by Russia in 4x50 m 4 knots relays.
A regret for Bousquet, who was looking at the world record of 50 m free, with the mark in large bass (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of the swimming, the 50 m free, is the 28-year-old French who was imposed in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took off against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet advanced Croatia Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world mark (20.30) as he had planned.
We can always dream better and at the same time, I had said that if the world's record was at my side, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were wearing polyurethane combinations, which will be prohibited from 1 January.
At the beginning of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations ended their era in Istanbul, which had received the first in 1999, at the same competition.
The use of combinations did not serve this time in German Paul Biedermann, a double world champion in large bass this summer in Rome, records of the world at the key.
The young swimmer did not succeed in lowering the mark he held on 400 m free swim (3:32.77) but was nevertheless forced by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), in front of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give up on this race.
I knew I couldn't beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and fulfill my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: a sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola adjudicated 1.5 million USD
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to the French writer Emile Zola was awarded $1.5 million on Thursday, obviously above his estimate, announced the art merchant Sotheby's.
This panel was estimated to be between $150,000 and $250,000 in front of two meters of height of 63 cm, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ.
The marble "representing four dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural decoration, surrounded by satires and baccantes, is a rare feature, there are only four or five in the world," said AFP on Tuesday Florent Heintz, vice president of the art auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's.
It was sold in a hundred lots.
The sale is still under way, but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have the most bought so far, AFP reported a spokesperson for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back to a few days.
The panel remained close to 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, and subsequently appeared with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it a part of his bathing room in his private Parisian hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister under the Third Republic of France and briefly President of the Council prior to the accession to the power of the Mayor Petin.
It remained a shadow zone for about fifty years.
By searching the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Eile Zola Succession" opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the freshness of the "Rougon-Macquart".
An abortion attempt from Zelaya of Honduras to Mexico
Mexico considered Thursday that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer on its territory of the president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who had refused to conduct a separate conduct by the Putschist government.
For the time being, after a telephone conversation in the evening with President Zelaya, it seems to indicate that the possibilities for this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
He arrived in Salvador on Wednesday to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government plane departed to its original location, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
The Putschist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "demission" and to ask for political asylum abroad to grant him an exclusive conduct.
But the deputed president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as a guest head of state.
The Putschist government "has experienced a new failure in wanting me to give up (...), they wanted me to resign," said on Thursday Mr. Zelaya on the Globo radio, on which it has often expressed itself since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the country of Central America.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing a few agreements with the late president, who has been a refugee at the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Embassy of Mexico has presented us with a request for extra conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain a request for asylum, said on Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the Putschist Government, Oscar Raul Matute, on the HRN Honduran radio.
I didn't ask for asylum in any country, I had answered Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Telesur chain, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras would have to become the president of the Hondurasn people, he had stressed.
The outgoing rumors of Mr. Zelaya had mobilized the president's disembarked supporters on Wednesday, who had gathered around the Brazilian Embassy, where the military had strengthened their seat.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the position of the Putschist government.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government with regard to international standards, he considered.
Zelaya, who had approached the Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, had been reversed on 28 June, the day he held a popular consultation to prepare his election against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he returned by surprise on September 21 and fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
If he does, he will be arrested for the crime of "high treason" against which he is accused of justice, according to the Putschist government.
The Putschist President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial poll recognized by the United States but challenged by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street goes up, the US trade balance feeds on optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday, the US trade balance figures testifying to the resumption of activity in both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones won 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has advanced from 68.78 points to 10,405,83 points, and Nasdaq, a technologically dominant, from 7,13 points to 2,190,06 points.
The standard & Poor's 500 extended index was adjusted to 0.58% (6.40 points) at 1.102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza, of the Financial FTN.
But this remains anecdotal, has it slowed down, believing that the market focused on "the glass half full".
For Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the figures of the US trade balance, "which show that the activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The trade deficit in the United States decreased by 7.6 per cent in October compared with September to $32.9 billion.
The analysts expected a rise in the deficit.
Imports that exports have increased as well.
The big news is the growth of trade volumes, especially for exports of goods, which reflects the growth of economies of the major trading partners in the United States, commented Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new unemployment registrations in the United States have increased against any expectations last week, reaching 474,000 applications.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new jobseekers "has fallen to the lowest in a year," said Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The compulsory market has fallen.
The 10-year Treasury's return rose to 3,482 per cent against 3,423 per cent on Tuesday night and to 4,492 per cent against 4,408 per cent on Wednesday night.
Cuba: Hundreds of power supporters make the "White Ladies"
A few hundred members of the Cuban government were concurred on Thursday of the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the World Day of Human Rights, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were intertwined.
A quarter of "White Women", wives or close to political prisoners, were seized in the streets by Raul Castro's government supporters as they marched to the capital centre to claim the release of political prisoners, a journalist from the AFP noted.
Down the Yankees!, "mercenes!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raul!" were blackmailing, the raised point, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who came to "insure their protection".
The watch, a similar event had taken place against the "White Ladies" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to manifest themselves on Thursday for the International Day of Human Rights were, intertwined by police officers in civilian areas, found an AFP journalist.
Policemen have forced the dissidents into civilian vehicles who have been confiscated by government supporters, according to this journalist.
Dissident interference in similar circumstances generally takes only a few hours.
The recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize in the European Parliament, the "White Ladies" had set up an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners", in the number of 200 according to the dissident, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda was part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 remained under the locks.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be "mercenes" or "agents" in the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
In short, Cuban television reported the demonstration of Thursdays of pro-government militants against "anti-revolutionarys".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of fusing rights and freedoms, including expression.
An officer kills an octogen in the knife and hurts 5 people in Clichy-la-Garenne
An army of two knives killed an octogenaire and injured five other people in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour of influence, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old attacker would have struck with two knives and for unspecified reasons, an octogenary, in or in front of a drug of the 85 boulevard Jean-Jaurès, learned from police sources and witnesses.
Griefly wounded, the old man, born in 1929 according to a officer of the Alliance police union, died at the hospital following his injuries.
In or before this same drug, he then took it to a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, who was 30 years old, got involved and was injured.
The first two victims, severely injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogener had collapsed.
The days of the other injured are in danger, and vital organs are apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then made a malaise and would have been hospitalized "in a state of shock", according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under the control of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then be gone into the street, still boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He would have injured two passersbys, apparently by chance: a thirty-one and a forty-one, the last scratch.
The scenario remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two mouth knives that he wore in cross behind his back, explained on the spot a head of the Alliance union in the Uppers-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, according to testimony collected by the AFP, tried to control the force.
I've seen a kind of thirty-year-old with a green dress.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was expensive, reported Alberto, the server of a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal police officer who broke his arm, he added.
At the height of 61, two municipal policemen, whose responsibility, Jean-Jaurès, were still trying to interfere with the armed man and were wounded by punches, according to police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many trades.
Passers came to tell me there was someone injured outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old on the ground, I put him in a safe position, and I saw a very important blow to the abdomen, told Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person of thirty years arrived, injured with knives.
These are national police officers who arrested the man who had no identity papers.
The Nanterre Parquet seized the departmental judicial police service of the High-De-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The officer was hospitalized on Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in the context of his in-depth custody.
A police source has not excluded him from being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, he needed six police officers to control Clichy's police station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of exhilaration" as "all the forces of this species whose forces fail under the influence of the action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer once again claims abandonment of prosecutions
The French-Polish filmmaker's lawyer Roman Polanski called for a new Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States), abandoning prosecutions against his client, currently assigned to reside in Switzerland for a death case of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", denounced three judges of the California Second District Appeal Court of serious procedural errors at the time of the facts in 1977.
I demand the discharge of charges here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- deceased since -- would have discussed, before making his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious procedural failure.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wished and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had lied to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court would refuse to give up the prosecution, Mr. Hummel claimed the holding of a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The charge has reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no discharge of charges could be seriously studied until Roman Polanski would appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, prior to his sentence, for "unlawful sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
He's never laid foot in the United States since.
The Deputy Prosecutor of the County of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, thus stated that Roman Polanski "should be here to appear at the hearing."
In this case, would you like to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to escape?, Mrs. Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker "requests a favor to the court, while contempting her authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed that "there were other alternatives to escape".
Mr. Hummel was not the only one asking for abandonment of persecution against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, the end of the prosecutions.
Recalling that his client no longer supports being harassed at every rebound of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure has been just.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was assigned to residence in his Gstaad cabin, waiting for any extradition.
Wall Street ends with no direction, slowed by dollar increase
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday, in a market with better indicators than expected in the United States and the dollar increase: Dow Jones won 0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is mounted from 65.67 points to 10,471,50 points, while the Nasdaq, a technologically dominant, left 0.55 points to 2.190,31 points.
The standard & Poor's 500 extended index has progressed from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, Mace Blackxilver, from Marblehead Asset Management, noted.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of exchange has become very low and I think it will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend has been supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned, which "have helped to improve the market's view on the solidity of economic recovery", analysts from Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month of the year and much more than expected.
The confidence of American consumers was further significantly reduced in December to 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices have been halted by a new advance of the dollar, at the top of two months in front of the euro, which "has pushed down the sectors that are sensitive to the economic situation", said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
Technology has thus lost ground.
The compulsory market has fallen.
The 10-year Treasury's return rose to 3.540 per cent against 3.482 per cent on Wednesday night and 30-year-old to 4.497 per cent against 4.492 per cent on Wednesday night.
Miss World Election Again in South Africa
After a month of bordering across South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are ready to cross the right line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
At this great mass of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already dropped their ticket for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were chosen Miss sports or Miss top model during their African stay.
That was a real tourbillon.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and the Cap was amazing.
I've seen a lot of things and I've lived so many experiences!
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, has been broadcast live on Saturdays since Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17:00 (15H00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to give up my crown.
This experience has been fascinating.
I am happy to have lived it twice, says Miss Monde Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the Australian summer.
For young Russians, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with candidates and the rediscovery of "landscapes to cut the blow in this country".
After a month of galas, repetitions, meetings with the press and safari, Miss now focuses on the competition.
The Indian Poja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and presents this election, as well as those of Ashwarya Rai in 1994, both becoming Bollywood stars.
It is the dream of every woman to be crowned the most beautiful of the world, but it is nothing but the appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our country and I want to go home with the crown, launch Miss India with a wide smile.
According to organizers, music and dance will score this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in a traditional and, of course, in a bathrobe.
The show will be animated by a TV shower, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a committee manager Miss Monde Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knew how to welcome the world with warmth and pride that it is difficult to compare, assures Julia Morley, President of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari, visited Soweto's famous township, but this time on bicycle, and enjoyed the local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met South African President Jacob Zuma, who closed their hands.
Not running for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will no doubt remain the draw to the Cape (South West) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to promote a little more event.
I've been with people I never thought I could get close.
I'm sure I'll come back for the World-2010, excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive", according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive", assured his son David on Friday at Los Angeles airport, where he had to go to his father's head hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, it happens very well, said in the press David Hallyday at his departure from the plane that took him to Paris shortly after 1300 locals (21H00 GMT).
The son of the singer, the retired air, assured him that he was going to go to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a subsequent infection with the operation of a discale hernie on November 26th in Paris.
The singer was "put in artificial coma this night in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and being able to administer his treatment," the press service reported.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed as an artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted Monday for a subsequent infection with the operation of a discelle hernie on November 26th in Paris.
The singer had to be reopened on Wednesday night to Thursday due to major injuries resulting from the intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where their daughter Jade, to attend a school show, found a photographer from the AFP.
The Chief of Orthopedic and Traumatological Surgery at the Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would return to Los Angeles on Monday to the singer.
The producer has violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on 26 November at the International Clinique du Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were different, said Mr. Camus.
I heard about a possible judicial procedure to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus felt that Johnny Hallyday was "too fast for Los Angeles, with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon".
I had this on-line doctor who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and that was stupid, since I had two discotheque hernies myself, he added.
Earlier on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "part without drain, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajouux is very well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trentignant in Vilnius a few days before his death in a Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he also performed by actress Charlotte Gainsburg to resuscitate a hematoma following a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor of sulphurous reputation, convicted on several occasions by justice, in medical cases, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Medical Order, accused him of being "a man without scruples" pursuing "regularly" before the Council of Order, and who is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed himself on Friday through his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
The latter indicated that the intervention was "perfectly well done" and that post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not need a drain," he added.
In any event, the singer's turn, whose health problems have increased since this summer, seems to be between parentheses.
Of course, a resumption of the tour on January 8th (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The UDF Association increased the tone and sum the New Centre to no longer use its seal
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the OPA's attempt by the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the seal of the former giscardian party, keeping him from using it on any basis, without prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF seal, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political heritage after holding his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, also planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
To support his approach, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP passed to the NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand to have been the first to deposit it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the UDF office, controlled by friends from François Bayrou who do not agree to settle down, came out of silence to launch a stay with the minister and the MP, summarizing that they no longer use the seal and pass on the brand's property to them, subject to judicial proceedings.
You have multiplied, in recent days, the statements indicating that you are going to propose to your political movement of +repere+ the UDF seal, write the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centralist Alliance.
You also thought it best to follow on your military equipment and on your website's watch page, the name of this movement, the +New Centre+, the slogan + the UDF today+, also detects the signatories of the mail.
As you do not know, you have no right to use this seal, explains the UDF office that keeps the NC to remove "immediately the name of the UDF from any medium as well as from (its) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (la) mark to its legitimate rightholders".
If you didn't, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories prevent.
In their mail, they state that the UDF "is a full political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "choosed" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as others did in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the UDF seal (Union for French democracy).
They also recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 for its membership in the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
With regard to Hervé de Charette, he continued the office, "when he deposited the mark", he was no longer a member of the UDF for three years", but at the UMP.
It is scandalous and fraudulently exploiting the absence of the UDF acronym to do so for its own account.
This indelicacy is becoming a crime, condemning them, before ironing on the NC strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name by itself than to try to get out of the anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which we are not entitled."
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as he was accused of by billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he benefited from a state of weakness of the octogenaire for robbing part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photographs of stars, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a maximum sentence of three years imprisonment and EUR 375,000 fine.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which the mother and daughter are divorced while holding the reindeer of the empire of cosmetics L'Oréal.
But the 15th Chamber of Correction also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, 87, should be conducted jointly by three doctors.
L'Oréal's main heir and shareholder has always refused to submit to such a review, in any case under the conditions proposed by Nanterre's prosecutor during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will report before 10 March 2010 in particular whether Liliane Bettencourt was in a state of weakness and at what times.
I think she'll submit.
I'm going to talk to him about it, he told the lawyer of Ms. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman at the hearing.
For his part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is an excellent new one (...) The expert will demonstrate that he (Mr. Banier) has manipulated this old lady to be protected, has he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has been prosecuted in prison against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and a touch-and-touch artist, who has been accused of having benefited for years from her mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros of gifts, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master's tables.
On her side, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to have been manipulated by the photographer, who she considers to be a long-standing friend.
While the court was required to examine the admissibility of the action undertaken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyers' complaints sometimes turned to the large family decommissioning on Friday.
As a result, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was embittered by Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to her since her marriage."
On the other hand, Nanterre's prosecutor once again considered that the complainant was not eligible for action, since more than one of the judges refused to do so these last days to apply to open a court-martial procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in court, she is not protected and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in place," said the public ministry representative Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would be decided once the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been futile...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large enterprises for the purpose of its employees, recalls the position of consumers before the marketing revolution: it is to make employees adhere to "values" determined above as it used to be, to impose on consumers the products thought of by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put market conquest strategies in place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose disconnected products from customer preferences factors returns regularly!
A demobilization of employees can lead to a mortifying demobilization.
The suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects the leaders in particular.
This demobilisation seriously undermines the development of all the company's intellectual functions, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE "needs all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a vision" ; it requires on the part of employees a commitment that the revenues of management are totally inconsistent with.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would put employees at the centre of the company's concerns to the same extent as the customer.
Any related utility of internal opinion investigations
Internal opinion surveys – like the questionnaire submitted by Orange to his employees – will they encourage this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I have found that, in the face of a new situation, any structure finally comes, after many detours, to do what she has always done.
- Then, because of authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
From major engineering schools, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the United States-wide "neuroscities" and widely distributed, on their own, by the Institutes of Studies and the Media.
Thus, suggesting that the "leviers" (sic) of the commitment of the officers are possible, a recent investigation of Ipsos in Le Figaro.fr comforts the leaders in a position of mechanical governance, which is not suitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises is intended to adopt a final view of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental statement: for employees, the commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears to be a means of realizing part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from the motivational analysis adopt this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they judge their business by based on a pre-defined doxa that allows them, through their perception of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to carry out their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and return their human resources management "to the place".
They thus create an area conducive to the concerted development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: The "just war" is worth praise to the right in Obama
The U.S. law welcomed the speech delivered on Friday in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had awarded the award to Mr. Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, the former candidate for the Vice-President at the 2008 elections.
I loved what he said, said Mrs. Palin, the leader of the right wing of the Republican Party, to the daily USA Today, adding that she herself has addressed the theme of the war "sometimes necessary" in her memories that have just been published.
The war is of course the last thing in my opinion that Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop these terrorists everywhere, she thought.
Mr. Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, used Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr Obama, Newt Gingrich, felt that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really good, and congratulated the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential speech.
On some sides, I found this all-historic talk, said Mr. Gingrich, interrogated at the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected, considered by some as a potential candidate for the 2012 presidential election, was delighted to have seen "a left-wing president" remind members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not give a prize of peace if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, the former pen of George W. Bush, the chronicler at Washington Post, Mr. Obama said "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting themselves as "citizen of the world" as "he always does," "he spoke as an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they did not create and that they do not do much to preserve it," said Mr. Gerson.
Among the rare to the right not to be convinced, a Bush era faucone, the former ambassador to the UN John Bolton, qualified the speech of "new, ampulated and without inspiration" on the National Review Online site.
At the left of the President, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When we embrace war in the sense of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the press of the gauche centre remained commendable at the president's place.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel had been given premature to Mr. Obama, qualified for his "superproduction" speech even for a well-known speaker for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression", the California daily burned down.
Mr. Obama "declared the speech he needed," said the New York Times, judging him as "both dark and building".
Routes: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiations, road trade unions and Tlf, the sole employer organization to remain until the end of Friday evening, reached an agreement ending with the word of strike and the threat of Christmas supplies.
At the signing meeting on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" of this agreement, after several negotiations, started on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators left early Friday morning, hoping to sign the text of the agreement quickly at the end of the morning.
And the same if three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTHER) had locked the door.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting beginning at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and for the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very harmful to businesses" and "was to fear that it would have disturbed the end of the years," said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
At the hourly rate, for low wages, "we move from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not a big deal, but we're far away, said Patricia Clos (FO).
Either we're going to order our militants that there's no lockdown, no lockdown of the food centers.
But we can always have some recalculators that are not happy, has he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement", even though it was "hard to grant increases on high wages in view of international competition".
According to him, increases will be EUR 170 per month for low wages and EUR 100 to 120 for the highest.
This is the agreement of good sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to him as "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the revalidation of the travel costs of 3%, and the general status of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will, inter alia, address the issue of a 13th month and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of EUR 100 million from the employer's charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending financial law for 2009, voted on Thursday night to Friday by the National Assembly.
The Government will ask the Senate to vote "in an identical manner".
The TLF signature allows the agreement to be applied for the first time to enterprises associated with this organization, and for the second time, to all professions, in the case of extensions by the Minister of Labour.
She will become "in the shortest time," said Mr. Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denouncing a " ash market", as the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in the conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to contradict the food of the next Awake!, he deplores Unostra.
For the other, the agreement "is likely to increase the fall of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this week-end, trade unions dissatisfaction with RATP proposals
The disturbances on RER A, France's largest urban transport line, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday at the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and management of the RATP left them hungry for their premium application.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of purchases before Christmas, there will only be trains between 10h00 and 20h00, due to a train on two on the central trunk (between the Defence and Nation) and a train on four off the central trunk.
The connection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change train.
The Lafayette Gallery, which awaits 200,000 customers every day, was delighted that "RATP is making efforts to serve the big shops".
The APR across the west is the Parisian agglomeration.
The short RATP trunk of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains circled at the point hours, and almost no branch within hours, as planned.
As on Thursday, there was no cohue on which the French were organized.
In the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequent than usual, especially because of the absence of colleges and colleges.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), a 29-year-old engineer, Jack Nbakina explained that he had been up "thirty hours earlier, to be sure to arrive at the time".
The Saint-Lazare Station did not know of saturation, the SNCF indicated, which had planned a framework of agents and forces of order.
The RERs operated by the SNCF from or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare Station to join the metros.
A new general assembly of miners will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, judged "great" by the trade unions, from a meeting with the management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of R & D proposes to negotiate a specific R & D protocol on all aspects, working time, career, etc.
This is not what drivers want, which claims a prize due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even makes its proposals as a bonus between parentheses, the CGT became angry, stressing that the management "was not prepared to solve a problem while in the road and SNCF it was done".
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday for "a broader review of the working conditions", RATP said.
What also told the trade unions that the company "was laughing at the users of the weekend".
In the morning, some 150 drivers invaded a headquarters committee in Paris.
It was then that the management, who thus refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested the meeting "in an interest in housing".
The conflict threatens to expand to RER B on Tuesday, following the submission of a warning by Unsa and Independents.
The unions apply for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, 30 of which are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on the line to millions of daily travellers.
RER drivers, all in the second part of their career, reach between 2,200 and 2,700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros in premiums for discounted hours, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the pro-Kurdish party, hard decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court pronounced on Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could be very complicated to the Government's task, which had just stretched its hand to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) has been dissolved because it has become "a home of activities that are harmful to the independence of the State and its indivisible unit", the President of the Court of Hasim Kiliç said in the press at the end of four days of discussion.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes were required to pronounce the dissolution, said Mr. Kiliç, adding that 37 of the party's members, including President Ahmet Türk and MEP Aysel Tugluk, are political life-banners for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity to which Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk were entitled and the confiscation by the Treasury of the Party's property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without label.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
However, the party ensures that he has no "organic links" with the PKK but refuses to qualify as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with him.
The Court's verdict is when the government has just stretched its hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, in order to try to draw Kurds' support to the PKK and end the conflict.
The DTP leaders had argued that a dissolution could lead to a rise in tensions in the South-East Anatolian, where numerous protests against the conditions of detention of PKK Chief Abdullah Öcalan have been degenerated with the police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, a thousand protesters gathered in front of DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great city of the south-east populous majority of Kurdes.
The forces of the order pulled lacrymogen grenades and used water cannons, while demonstrators launched molotov cocktails or stones, with springs.
A hundred people have also shown up in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk stated that the Court's decision was "to deepen despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, etc.) by banning a party, has it declared to the press.
The Government, formed by a party from the Islamic movement, also deplored the decision.
We are, in principle, opposed to the closing of the parties.
That does not solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total waste of the democratic opening launched by the government, the political analyst Ahmet Insel commented.
Of course, we can expect a response from the PKK to be added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
The first snows can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very strict winter.
But the responsible for the road derailment and sanding service (FES) makes it clear that it is not to mislead citizens.
It's just so that the officers can test the vehicle technique and learn to control them well.
And according to the meteorologists, this could be good for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to attack snow and glass.
The ESF follows a well-developed plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explained that as soon as he turned his back on the city of Frankfurt and that the temperatures were coming down below zero, there were 20 main routes (named itineraries A).
This includes high-speed streets, major arteries, such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
It also includes firefighting, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and pedestrian streets such as Atzelbergstraße.
FES agents start their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road must be sold with a road floor that fits well, within 3 hours of maximum time.
That's why the FES service starts at 3:00 a.m. "to get the roads off when daily migration traffic begins."
There or there it gets harder, it's when the snow falls at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, he tells us that the road derailment and sanding service is responsible for "because no car driver is willing to let the salad vehicles pass".
Then, if it is no longer snowing, we take care of access routes and dessert routes - such as Rat-Beil-Strasse.
Secondary roads and side streets come last.
Mr Brauburger well knows that this is always a matter of complaint.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES Pedestrian Team is on its way to get out of the dangerous areas and passage.
With regard to cyclable tracks, FES services are generally unable to deal with it.
Mr. Brauburger said that there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the state of the bridges between 22 and 430 hours.
As the glass forms very quickly on these surfaces, the salad vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
There is also a need for the police to use this special service.
The Dinosaurs' Barrier
The Hallae Tawa was similar to other carnivorous dinosaurs: the bipedal was about 2 meters long for 1.50 m high, its posterior members were powerful, its long skull was provided with acreted and curved teeth, its short arms ended with facilital grips and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But like the report Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and his colleagues in the magazine Science of Thursday, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs to have these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which made it part of the land that emerged from the supercontinent, the Pangée and was on the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the bright Tawa of a new day is the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
In fact, it teaches us about parental ties, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
It is in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt carried out searches with other palontologists on the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History of Utah and a member of the team of searches reports that they sometimes found a dozen bones in a day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists have quickly realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The research has updated the remaining five species.
A discovery that confirms theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers baptized him in the name of Tawa according to the word of the Hopi Indians for the god of the sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: the fossils of dinosaurs from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few fragments of incomplete bones.
All paleontology experts do not share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, but he states that it confirms certain theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth some 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify all the first dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, at the time when the Saurians were divided into three major evolution groups: the tropods (carnivores) which include the later tironosaur and the cycliptor and which descend the birds, the sauropods, the quadrupeds on the long tail, and those related to them and the herbivores of the Ornithian species such as the triretops and the stegosaure.
According to studies by S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is one of the first theorists.
This species presents an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers have found indications that the Tawa hallae had small air bags in its bones at the skull level, as well as the birds that are the descendants of the therapists.
These small air pockets facilitate the breathing of birds compared to mammals.
It seems that at the Tawa hallae, the vertebrates were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theorists to have small air bags in its bones.
As the related line of immense sauropods also had airbags and a light tent, it can be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive wave of migration to North America.
As the earliest known dinosaurs lived in South America, researchers concluded that the Saudis were there.
Therefore, the three major lines of evolution have been divided and split from South America to the rest of the world, that is to say, all the emerging lands that formed the Pangea supercontinent.
This appears to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists has also discovered the remains of two other theorists that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have moved, advancing the researchers.
Alan Turner of the Natural History Museum of New York and co-author of the Science Studies magazine said there would have been at least three migration waves to North America.
There have been some contradictions.
Martin Sander, paleontologist in Bonn, says that there is an even older species, the silhouette, who lived in the present Poland and belonged to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a wrong vision because there is a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved when there is virtually no such thing on other continents.
On the other hand, how did the dinosaurs become the dominant tetrapods of the second century while they came from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile branch, still a mystery remains today.
At the time of the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of the present crocodiles and many other Saudis.
Towards the end of the Tria the dinosaurs spread across the planet, thus promoting the development of many new species, while others, who were related to them, disappeared between the Tria and the Jurassic.
However, such success is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two assumptions.
There could be a massive extinction to which dinosaurs have accidentally survived while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or at the time, the dinosaurs were better adapted and were therefore able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a favorable meteorite was the development of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and had been growing in the shadows since then: it was mammals.
The solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories all over the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are those in charge of courses at the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bréme.
The evacuation by the casino police at J.W. Goethe University of Frankfurt makes waves all over the world.
278 professors and teachers at J.W. Goethe University, as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North America and South America express their solidarity with the Protestant students of Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they condemn the intervention of the police claimed by the university's governing committee.
Last week, the President of the University of Werner Müller-Estler had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers after the walls and works of art were barbowed with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
Signatories believe that the degradation did not justify "a violent intervention on the part of the police team against students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Evacuation is an "inadmissible attack" on freedom of research and education.
Focusing exclusively on acts of vandalism serves only to "delegate and criminalize the protest" and trying to forget the reasons for mobilization.
The University Steering Committee thus drew attention to discussions that would still be essential.
Course officers demand immediate suspension of criminal proceedings.
The majority of the population did not participate in the degradation.
Legitimization of protests
The young members of the Green Trade Union of the Service Sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (GID) are a team of students.
The protests are only the legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, said Alexander Klein, regional secretary of the youth of the Verdi union.
With regard to the Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took action and was responsible for the action undertaken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of places is totally unacceptable, she told the regional Parliament of Wiesbaden last Thursday during the TV show Current Hour.
We understand the meaning of the protests, but we do not accept vandalism, Mrs Peter Beuth said.
The parliamentary groups of the opposition SPD, the Greens and the Gauche (the Left) did not share that view.
The CSU takes the pretext of a few painted walls to criminalize the protests, said Janine Wissler of the La Gauche (Linke) party
Instead of reflecting on student arguments and claims, they are evacuated.
The La Gauche party has filed a motion that the Interior Minister submits a report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new Silicon Valley
For a long time it was considered a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was under the Soviet regime a place to search for the secret weapon, under strict surveillance.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet Silicon Valley.
Important sites of production and research in micro- and nanoelectronics are located there.
Since September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, a place of French sciences – with the university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were mutual and Wednesday meetings of the representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Strong Cooperation Protocol".
The signatories were the deputy mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz head of project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strength is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies wish to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and research companies.
There is the Institute of Electrical Engineering in Moscow, the major Sitronics companies and Rossijskaja-Electronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literally translated "Green City") draws its name from the wooden hills of which the research centres are located.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The size of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be sufficiently high.
For its participants, this is nothing less than "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the intrusion of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will fill the heart of the capital of Bade-Wurtemberg, in a chaos that is desperate for ten years.
Stuttgart 21 was born in the spirit of the 1980s.
The railway stations, with roads that ended up in the city, had the reputation at the time of being the remains of the 19th century transport technology that had effect from the brakes of modern rail traffic, as it took a long time to pass the locomotives from the back to the front.
Come on, stop short, go – that's what you have to do.
That's why the line-heads have to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart too: a train passage station, which is about halfway across the Trans-European Railway Magistrate between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, where the slogan "the heart of Europe" is from.
The implementation of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s have long been compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost, to get the station into the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
In fact, the main line stations no longer really have problems of entry and exit since there are modern, reversible trains with auto and pilot cars at both ends.
However, the implementation of Stuttgart 21 is now being launched next to the new route from the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and community policies have taken this.
The railway company is on the side, because it is the taxpayer who makes the cost of the largest project infrastructure of the Federal Republic rather than the public company.
From a urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
There is a urban space that, if you believe in the graphics of computer-generated planners, will be very green.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the expansion of the section are designed for a traffic of people to whom it was attributed - and is typical of the 1980s - a huge increase.
At the time, there was still no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening trade in goods, as rail transport is much more respectable to the environment than by road truck.
But the new track, with its tilts, does not fit the freight trains.
The S21, which is much more serious, deals indirectly with many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be invested in the Souebe project.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade, this money will be missing for other points of joining and engorging in the network.
The Department of Transport lists 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the expansion of the section through the Rhine Valley of 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987 this line has been built at the slow rate.
It would be really urgent to support here deep on the mushroom.
But the S21 project has the effect of a braking shoe.
The Rhine Valley route is about to become the world's most expensive waste of international trade, and it is at the heart of Europe.
Government examines the judgment rendered regarding the airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Government of the Land referred to the possibility of appeal to the Hesse Administrative Court for the prohibition of night flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to examine from a legal point of view the judgement rendered by the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the country should adapt the regulation on the prohibition of night flights in the case or the construction of the north-west runway at Frankfurt airport would be carried out.
The authorization to land 17 aircraft between 23 and 5 a.m., as the Government of the Land considers, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air damage.
The coalition must have decided on 4 January if it wishes to make an appeal against the judgment rendered.
The opposition criticises this time-limit and tries to pressure the representative of the government for him to surrender to the Federal Administrative Tribunal of Leipzig.
The leader of the parliamentary group SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections, which was to ban the night flights. Otherwise, it will be regarded as a total failure to give a given word.
It is extremely difficult to be allowed to keep his word, said the Chief of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP's election slogan "We keep our promises."
Minister Dieter Posch rejects Schäfer-Gümbel's accusations that the country's government is trying to authorize night flights by using "advocacy and robbery".
It takes time to conduct a specific legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "fast first impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition concerning the statements by its party on the prohibition of night flights is completely out of the question.
U.S. banks repay the aid granted
The large American banks, very affected by the crisis, are at the heart of their relations with the State.
The Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully repaid the Treasury $45 billion (more than €30 billion), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp Rescue Plan.
The American television channel CNBC reported on a report Citigroup was also planning to refund the aid received.
Bank institutions are thus seeking to remove the restrictions imposed, which were accompanied by acceptance of the amounts, such as the limitation of the bonuses awarded to the manager and the higher costs regulation.
The Bank of America launched an increase in capital by selling securities to investors who reported to it $19 billion in cash.
The rest of the sum comes from bank deposits that are well filled by the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, the Director General of Bank of America, had a strong commitment to thank US taxpayers: the injection of capital has greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had assumed its capacity by purchasing Merrill Lynch's investment bank to the strongest of the financial shock.
The Citigroup also plans to provide money on financial markets to free itself from State protection.
The U.S. bank could thus launch an increase of $20 billion on Thursday, reporting the CNBC chain quoting banking environments.
Citigroup spokesperson did not wish to comment on this information.
In June, the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
Finally, everything happened even faster than planned.
Just two weeks after the replacement of the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the German ZDF's Board of Directors, the successor is already appointed.
The Committee wished to vote yesterday to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who runs the Berlin edition of ZDF, was the great favor.
However, the chain did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also the wish not to further harm the ZDF member Markus Schächter in the event that the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 Commission members on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract for five years, but this had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council voted in favour of the resumption of Brender and 7 others voted against. Brender's resignation by vote was a failure, but it was also predictable for Schächter.
In fact, the Board of Directors who is a majority of the Board of Directors had already been allowed to hear several weeks before the vote, not wanting to reinstate Brender at his post.
It was Roland Koch, the Prime Minister of the Land of Hesse who had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly estimated editor-in-chief by claiming that the hearing rate for ZDF information issues had dropped under Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, suffocating the growing political influence on the ZDF.
At the end, there were even 35 experts in public law who had implicated themselves in the debate and who believed that the way in which Koch acted was anti-constitutional.
But it won't serve anything.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political sciences, teaching and Roman languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Southwest Funk (Rhenania-Palatinate radio station) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German national quota).
In 1983 he became a writer in the ZDF first in the journal of current "day-day" (now's journal).
Then his journey continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor-in-chief of the time; then he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazines" (bimonthly information issue presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then head of the Berlinic drafting.
After Brender's disgrace, while he was just elected a journalist of the year by the specialized magazine Medium Magazine, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint
The Adversary of Koch to the Board of Directors, the Prime Minister of the Rhine-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty of the ZDF so that the candidates' staff proposals could not be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of the political personalities of the ZDF Supervisory Committees.
Peter Frey, the likely successor of Brender had worked with the Board of Directors in criticizing the commission with vehemence in his decision to lick Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the position of editor-in-chief without losing face, as well as the Board of Directors could remove it without suspecting him to place a political party in the position.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified as left-wing liberal.
Large cleaning in university studies
Part success for students: after one year of education, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decided to become more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Board of Directors, an agreement was reached that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to relieve the weight of the examinations: a single examination should allow the selected study module to be closed.
Moreover, the workload will have to be reviewed to ensure "real and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also undertaken to organize more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master lines.
At the regional level, there must be no different regulation from one country to another.
Fewer exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the directors of universities have consistently expressed themselves in a fashion: "studiability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of certain examinations: "Each module must normally be completed by a single examination", one can read in a document of thirty pages on future conditions of admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, states that by significantly reducing the burden of the examinations, it should be possible to stop derailment, which would significantly damage the studyability.
"Studyability" should be the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies in the future.
Modules as well as the background must be carefully examined to see if you can't avoid this feeling of excitement that you sometimes feel in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest RAID knowledge on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate fraud.
Students should "have the opportunity and margin of manoeuvre necessary to allow and promote the personal initiative".
The new regulation will cover access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, however, which means that in 2015 only all cycles will be examined.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies across the federal territory that depend on the accreditation boards established by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put pressure on the Länder to focus on agencies so that the programmes were not overloaded and the review regime was not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized universities have already been consulted with their regional departments to take appropriate measures.
Rhenania-Palatinate has so far been the only country to have agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize programmes to strengthen educational guidance offices as well as the examination offices and the service of international relations
Länder and universities provide for a budget of EUR 10 million.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to submit to Parliament an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act.
As a result, there will be only one examination to close its studies.
The organization of studies should be more flexible, and the recognition of notes from other higher education institutions must be ensured and access to Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "researchability" of all academic cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition discussed the question of study conditions in the country.
The decisions were appreciated, but criticism was made.
The Federal President of the Association of Socialist Students announced that he would like the organization of education policy to be no longer "back to the closed doors" of the Ministers and university directors.
Not later than the educational strike, students as individuals should be able to express themselves a little.
The future diplomats of higher education received the support of the President of the delegates of the Directors' Conference (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of students is very useful to us," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom HRK works on a joint reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It demands the right and the possibility for each Bachelor graduated to join a Master cycle.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asks that the Länder provide the Bachelor students today, that there will be enough room for studies in Master and study conditions as good as possible.
The Länder must therefore hire more teachers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of facilitating access to the Master.
More than one bottom note on Herta Müller
It is by these words "coming to Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control" that begins a work by poet Werner Söllner, in which he is the subject of disturbing phrases, the experiences of a dissident who has gained freedom in Germany but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat in Romania, was first a German and English teacher in Bucharest and subsequently a collecting director in a youth publishing house before he moved to Frankfurt on Main.
Söllner received various literary prizes; in 1993 he held the highly coveted poetry chair at Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the Mousonturm's art house in Frankfurt.
He spoke a lot about him in non-literacy circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror deforming your security files".
Visiblely destabilized and enchanted, Söllner made a statement in which he recognized his German-Romanic colleagues as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer as an informer for the security police.
Söllner received the German language prize in 1989 together with some of the participants.
The enrolment tests had begun abruptly in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner, "so someone who has not enough to resist the attacks of intimidation of security".
poet Werner Söllner is informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and his cuneiform literature with the mechanisms of dictatorship power, the literary scene is deranged, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abism and weakness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say according to current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own Security file, IM Walter played a role, assures literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had intervened in his favor.
"He was able to remove it from all the difficult situations at the time," says Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and in front of this audience was unexpected, however, the dissident of his former collaboration with Romanian secret services is not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for security spies had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Di Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
It can be assumed that the victims will have made speculations and sometimes become what real names were hidden last by Sorin, Voic and Walter's loan names.
Instead of Germany, where in the meantime the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the inheritance of the Security files is still very confused.
A systematic clarification has been continuously contradicted and suspended over the past few years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the Security Archives (CNSAS) but the re-refund of the files has been drawn up since.
Since 2005, there has been a law that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still very large is confirmed by the interview of a former Head of the Security of Temesvar who, following the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expresses himself in a three-pronged way with regard to the winner.
She had a psychosis, and eventually she was interrogated only once.
The infamy of power thought to be able to express itself here, without any gene, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Of course, many outstanding issues are associated with the Söllner case as this happens so often in a hidden guilt context.
Why now? Who has been robbed? The weighted reaction of the audiences, to Söllner's cousin, lets hope that the result of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst to know than by accusations and a feeling of shame.
On the Genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Tumultes at the Champions League
It was the impression that a representative arrived there, shot at four corners coming all right from a Christmas party, on which the manufacturer of sports articles had cut off his goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross mounts at less than midnight the fourth in a Mercedes class C, which he just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier to his hand.
The man, whose skull would attract attention, let himself be led into the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise, our 50-year-old could have taken the wheel himself – he didn't drink alcohol and he wasn't happy anymore.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work had to be resumed.
Because it's going to start now.
The words of Switzerland that had just been engaged three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth end," that is, in the league of champions through our 3:1 against the Urziceni Unirea of Romania" but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success. This will be a brutal fight not to fall back."
The "great work" awaits us Sunday.
There it is to repeat the results of the Champions League in Mainz every day.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that have surfaced after the three expeditional goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Lots of drawings
The eighth final of the Champions League (match go 16/17. + 23/24 February/match return 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be shot at Nyon on December 18.
The joy of becoming a full-fledged successor of Babel was therefore moderate.
And joy was not measured only by the one who had been lucky, who had sent to the dissatisfactioned Stuttgart professionals, a no-good motivation and pleasure to play.
I saw the players and told them that they had to focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "sweet of souls" – Gross – the recipe of success that sounded so often that no longer had any effect with the care of Babel.
He triggered a certain magic, along with Jens Lehmann - partisan of Babbel - "in the foot when there is a new impulse there are sometimes things that one would never have thought possible".
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of break for injury, has advanced to the best player due to his dynamics, tries to describe the " phenomenon" found by a proviso "free wind" and the working method of the new boss: "It's someone who passes through the action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
But apparently Babbel missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart hasn't passed the head yet, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the time being, VfB Stuttgart needs tenacity.
Like Gross, players and the manager are careful to overestimate the victory against a completely over-defence and weaken the Romanian guests.
They also won in Glasgow before they had a bad wake four days later at Leverkusen with 0:4 , objecta Kedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the objectives of the season, but that they had others who were still far away.
We haven't passed the difficult one yet.
That Heldt on his 40th anniversary didn't have the heart to celebrate, even after the first victory at home for three months, is from the events of the weekend that a television interview by the target guard Jens Lehmann was rebounded just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, would contradict Heldt, in response to Lehmann's bitter criticism.
He accused the management of style weakness and said she had decided to change coach under the pressure of puberty fans.
Lehmann also considered it a sign of a lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day of freedom after the matches had been removed.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by a pure egoism" and Heldt announced the consequences for the goalkeeper.
They no longer risk becoming friends with these two quadrants.
In any case, they agreed for the rest, namely that without the group's preliminary work by the replaced coach, the strong sport and combat representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "for a great deal of success" and returned Heldt and Lehmann to heart – and even the man in the plastic bag aquiesça.
Heavyweight World Championship
Warming hot in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly provoked the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after 12 difficult rounds, Ukraine defends its heavyweight world championship title according to the WBC Federation version.
The Court of Justice was unanimous.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title as champion of the heavyweight world.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night, the 38-year-old champion won a victory at the points of the unanimity of the judges against American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko defends his title with honor since his comeback in October 2008.
In the past, the Ukrainian had twice won the world's WBO and WBC championship.
Unfortunately, he did not succeed so much as expected.
Klitschko, a 39-time winner in 41 professional battles, has to report twice his loss due to injuries.
The challenger Johnson has to accept his first defeat in the 24th battle.
In Berne's Arene, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, from the top of its 2,02 meters, on the left.
Johnson, 11 cm younger who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, managed to avoid the champion's beatings, thus preventing Klitschko from putting into action its dangerous right.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, especially tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures his blows only rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, having exceeded the distance of the twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the battle.
He insulted Klitschko's treatment of "violan zombie" who "is not really capable".
During Friday's weight, the champion couldn't stop himself from provoking Johnson by making him fall his sunglasses of the nose "to see his eyes".
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko has again been imposed in his fourth battle since his comeback on 11 October 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered the "sa" WBC belt he had previously left without fighting.
This year, defending his title as a champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Areola of the United States.
"I just took a shot in this fight and I'm in perfect shape," Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Vladimir is a WBO and IBF Federation champion.
But it is British David Haye who, having defeated the great Nikolai Waljew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko, which was due to take place in September.
It would seem that his promotion company is planning to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London now.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Verts parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Guttenberg of lies in the Kunduz case.
The parties SPD and La Gauche (the Left) ask the chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After considering the latest information on the Kunduz air attack, the opposition accused the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately disclosing certain facts.
The Minister deliberately "formulated a contraband" on the murder of two tankers last September, said the leader of the Greens parliamentary group Jürgen Trittin on Saturday during the ARD "Tagesschau" (Journal of 20h).
Clearly, that means he's lying.
The order to kill was given to the total disregard for the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is, in substance, the content of the report by NATO, which was read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the goal of the trap was, not to destroy stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured during the US air attack that had been launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Gauche asked the Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday, to speak as soon as possible before the federal Parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Verts Renate Kunast party are of the opinion that Madame Angela Merkel must state clearly whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the federal government's Afghan policy if the Chancellor, Army and Information Services approved this new strategy.
The Government ' s spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The Chancellor did not influence the military's interventions in Afghanistan in any way, he said.
On Saturday, votes were increasing to express doubts about the real reasons for the referral of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the Department.
According to the SPIEEGEL newspaper, the information they had sent to Guttenberg regarding the tanker attack was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have undermined the existence of NATO's report and hid some embarrassing details to the Minister.
However, in the vicinity of the two senior officials, it is reported that they informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeineer Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert would have in the meantime requested in an e-mail clarification of the facts.
To date, he has not received an answer
On Saturday, the Ministry did not wish to comment on these allegations and referred to the Federal Parliament's Committee of Inquiry, which was to be held next Wednesday in order to bring light to the facts in question.
The worlds of the dream
Some see, awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
There is nothing but mental illness, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is going very well.
When we're lying in our amazing rooms, we can notice without hindrance the worst dreams and ghosts.
However, the one who wakes up, experiences the state of dreams, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, has speeded up the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least to be an original.
Such images and voices appear only in mental patients or under the influence of drugs.
It's our imagination that's in question: it's the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint tables or write novels, but that sometimes stimulates the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to be found.
A conscious state of awakening, taking the form of a dream, can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called visions, at the worst of the madness.
But even if the trigger and effect differ, the visions of mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the Prophet of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the chamois, psychosis and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, neurotransmitter substances of the brain - first and foremost dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - breaks and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delirious thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
The force of earthly attraction no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and the dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of awakening; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 "a great similarity between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud's dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that make it up".
We're in autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into a cartoon character.
Its body is in two dimensions to the colors of the screaming.
The earthly attraction no longer has power over it, it plans at the edge of the ceiling.
He's feeling a blow.
Behind him are the creatures of the devil wings, grizzling, the bleeding mouth, showing the teeth.
They pursue him, give him feet with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain all over the body.
Sounding voices, evil, screaming, coming out of the walls and radio.
He can no longer bear those voices that insult him and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from his stereo channel, in fact a loop and attachs it to a hook fixed to the ceiling.
He goes up on a buffle and passes the loop around the neck.
He's out.
The loop is decomposing.
What a lesson it is for you to learn, screams in a heart to pull his timpan. "Go to a clinic and take care!"
Today Henning T. 40 years old, he lived six acute psychoses, the last two years, the first of almost 20 years.
It was triggered by the LSD.
Diagnosis: schizophrenia, paranoia, in addition to maniaco-depressive, it takes drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
During my psychosis, I lived through terrible fears and deep disappointments.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in their schizophrenia life; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenia crisis, the people concerned can no longer make the difference between the inner world and the outside world, they are in a state of hyper excitement, which can cause them to suffer from hallucinations, megalmonia, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are neither rare nor rare.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the minor, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is drowned under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the doors to a tide of ideas and ghosts from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of the reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum) .
The schizophrene is at the centre of the situation, all of which has a meaning centered on it.
At the same time it is found in a passive role, it is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general, they do not have the opportunity to adjust the reality, the illusions are a cruel reality, and waking up is excluded.
Make the experience once in your life of hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of the reality that is perceived during psychosis is essentially preserved".
Delirant thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of life takes place in a real framework.
Why does our brain make this kind of cabrioles, it's always an enigma for researchers.
Exceptional situations can lead everyone to temporarily lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a few people will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition in schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that the individuals concerned have abnormal brain damage.
The brain's neural maturation is supposed to be disturbed at an early stage of development, for example by a mother's viral infection during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is the way the anomaly of the neural system occurs and the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, if there is predisposition.
hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis as they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain warms.
What's crazy is, we're told by Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck, that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of it while others buy expensive drugs to get it.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on illustrative image hallucinations and phenomena for ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are very much part of the common phenomena of psychosis, but also an impressive number of other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, plaque sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or chronic trauma.
It is surprising to note that under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that treat sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently refractory; when our brain warms but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain injury or psychosis.
But also lack of stimuli, stress, bitterness of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, at least one third of the participants recognize that they have experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Pomériane before and goes to high school.
A young girl has everything to be normal to say.
If there were no images and voices.
During the recreation, a young boy, soft, long-haired, sends him the word.
When she answers her friends, they look at her, surprised – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy young girl is a moonish dreamer, but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's certain.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy just as she sees and she hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive her presence momentarily.
It's a pleasant feeling, she finds this nice young man.
I'm crazy, she asks you sometimes.
But she well knows that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the appearances are generally evasive.
Visions are often heavy.
When she is in class, she happens to be unable to follow the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is clearly explaining equations to the table.
At night the appearances are generally evasive.
When, in the dark of her room, she waits for sleep that arrives too rarely and too late, she often cannot make the distinction if she is awake or dreaming already, if the images she sees, the grinning faces or the young girl with bloodless details on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she screams at these creatures.
She doesn't talk to her parents or her friends, they'd take her for a fool.
In the autumn of 2009, Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She had her bacc last year and she lived with her friend.
The hallucinations stopped a year ago.
Since she came into contact with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Folly is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough incentives, the probability is that he has hallucinations at the end of a certain time.
I suppose the brain isn't busy enough, so there's animation.
Sarah K., the only daughter, was afraid of other children when she was young and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called Dad, since she was old to think, was not his real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, it is therefore very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience", according to Kasten "a place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, so they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenia, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that ghosts are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to enjoy hallucinations as a special talent.
There's only one thing between dreaming and hallucination.
In our world too focused on consciousness, we unfortunately have a quick tendency to take imaginary experiences for pathologists, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the psychiatric clinic and psychotherapy at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but which also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the form of experience said oniroid, a particular form of the change in consciousness awakened by the dream.
Oniroides are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that it cannot differ from the dream even when it is awake.
The state of oniroid consciousness is manifested during trauma or in extreme pathologies situations, as for patients with fully conscious polyradiculopathy, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is separate from reality.
It is a state of mental limit between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change in the world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
This is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, a capacity of organization that is given to us men, not to obscure in the absence of the loss of consciousness.
It's all real later in the memories.
The Zurichian Peter Cornelius Klassen, an art historian, also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "The Change of Heart" as a soul's saving action.
He is 49 years old, at the time when his conscious share for a journey of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is doomed to remain in real estate in reanimation.
Claussen dives into a world he created from all parts, visit foreign places, travel in time. He sees himself as an old man bound in a railway sanatorium, a robot with his hair watching over his health.
He lives in the middle of the age among the nobles who make blood-based drugs.
He is taken away by a Greek motorbike who takes him to his country, surfing with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meeting a Korean mafia.
It absorbs completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in its memories.
According to Claussen, these internal journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, writing in describing what he has lived.
Instead of dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intense than real life.
The intensity of this life is causing the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oniroides, psychosis, hallucinations and psychological experiences show us how fragile our internal representations of external reality are even in the state of care.
Any change in the state of consciousness, says psychologist Kasten "may cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
The first snows can fall
Burda
At 27 years of age, children will follow the publishing house.
Kallen's appointment to the Burda editions' PDG is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long run, editor Hubert Burda sees his company between the hands of his children
Both children will inherit 27 years of age and are firmly determined to integrate society, said Hubert Burda, 69, in Spiegel.
All details have been resolved in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will then arise.
We'll also have to see if they're capable of it.
It is not possible to impose its children on 7,500 employees without knowing whether they have the capacity to do so.
This would damage children as well as the company.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he retired from the post of President-General from January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52 years old, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was first responsible for the technology sector.
He then took care of the Treasury sector, namely that he was responsible for the company's capital and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took the lead in marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time it's not a family member who's in the head of Burda's editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment also serves to link the next 10 or 15 years."
Burda states that the holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
Ruins have always occurred in families that have been allowed to run through a capital bulimia, which have caused enormous unfortunate speculations, thinking that they could get worse and higher.
That was never my strategy.
I never dreamed of universal power, Burda said.
I absolutely do not see myself as the country's successor as Springer could be, and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues such as Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Full Beauty
All you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, is hand-held.
This is the goal that has been set by El Corte English, which has just entered the Callao commercial centre (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, includes prestigious teaching such as Hedonai, laser healing specialist, Spaxion, with its relaxation and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Taci, coffeurs, Marina d'Or, which has a sports room, or L'Occitine and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food radius, especially a tea room, which offers more than 130 different types.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner, while looking at the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relaxation area to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and to relax thanks to a session of jacuzzi, massages while drinking a cup of champagne.
In total, it is 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy care.
For example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The sports room also has these devices, as well as "virtual coaches" that guide customers' steps, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touchscreen, located in front of the device.
Several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise program.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (heating and rashes) are enough to make all the body muscles work.
And, if we have done our body work, we want to go through the coffee room, the teacher Luis & Taci has a room where we offer hair repair, lightness or nutrition rituals, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusion seem to have been the order words of this urban spa, which will be opened every day of the year from 10 a.m. to 22 p.m.
Miscellaneous
Christmas approaches and it's never superfluous to study the look of stars to adapt it to our party dress.
The form of decolletation, which is very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables we need to take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an excessive and very complicated decolletation. This is not very recommended.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The company Endesa, in collaboration with the City of Barcelona, created the "LIVE Office".
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (Logistics for the Installation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the road map for the implantation of the electric car in the city and establish mobility agreements, taking steps, coordinating, providing grants, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 “Electric Cities ”
But Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the implantation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Séville came to join the project.
These are the three cities selected by the government, within the framework of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the deployment of the electric car.
The Endesa electrical company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
It aims to promote research and technological development activities in the autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative that Endesa participates in with regard to the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in European-wide standardisation groups and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero interviewes "a future of peace" for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, spoke of "a future of calm" for the Spanish automotive industry, which he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
At the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures taken by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Car Sector Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a abandonment landscape, closing some of our main production sites," said the President of the government.
"Thanks to this plan and the decision of the brands to remain in Spain, in a highly competitive sector, we can consider a peaceful future for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, including the Full Plan for the Automobile Sector (PIA), devoted EUR 800 million to projects by 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliaries, which mobilized an investment of more than EUR 3 000 million.
The Chief of the Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also highlighted government support measures for demand, in line with Plan 2000E, in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6 per cent and contributed to a "high increase" of registrations, which increased by 40 per cent in November.
20 000 m2 of car collection
Madrid welcomes the first edition of the International Chamber of Car Collection, a meeting space for the professionals and passionates of the engine world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabellón de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
They are an exposure area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can we find motorcycles and car collection, but we will also find in ClassicAuto Madrid articles of any kind related to the engine world.
Thus, in the exhibitors of the pavilion, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will bring happiness to collectors and curiouss.
Among the participating companies, we will, among other things, find Classicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restaurant, Cupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and restaurants, or Cochera Classicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Exterior aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this salon will also include parallel activities: collections, sports exhibitions, fitness tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with cars and collection motorcycles will also be carried out on a built-in circuit outside the park of exhibitions.
Mazda3 i-Stop : A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda is willing to prove that the sport spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated on Mazda3 the engine stopping and starting system, baptized i-Stop, a device that is at least currently available only on engine 2.0 with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good note it has obtained in its entirety.
Details, vehicle finish, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable about the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fixation.
The touch of the wheel is also particularly pleasing to him.
By continuing with the overall set of controls and consoles, we see how Mazda continued in Japan's trend to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and commands, as well as live colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, are opposed to the sovereignty of German products, and especially to the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to overcome.
By continuing with the habitat, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitat to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to all this, a large box of regular forms is added.
The engine's automatic stop and start system, at least for the moment, is only available on the engine with two litres and 150 horses and with a manual change of the six speeds.
This engine is a real happiness. It is illustrated by its fineness, low noise, performance and control of its consumption.
In fact, although the most requested Mazda3 are diesel models, those who do not carry out a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-Stop with engine essence, both for its great comfort of speed and for its controlled consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the model selected for the test is the Sports, in other words the one that presents the largest number of serial elements.
Among the serial equipment, the road change assistant (RVM) that removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, the speed regulator, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, the rain and light sensor, the bluetooth and the audio bluetooth, as well as the 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly remarkable.
In addition, as if this equipment was not sufficient, this version had the Premium Pack, which includes, for more than 1,500 euros, among other elements of the bi-xenon adaptable headlamps and a BOSE audio system with disc chargers.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It is particularly illustrated by the quality of the materials used, by its behaviour and by its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not do many kilometres per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the 2.0 engine of 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, which is between €21,770 for the Luxury finish and €23,270 for the tested model, the Sportive.
In contrast to this important amount, Mazda3 will offer us a large dose of satisfaction every day.
"First" luxury
L.A. covers the red tape of sensuality incarnate by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have more than ever bloated us, dressed in as elegant as they are for Nina's release. (Photos : Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as usual, had chosen for a dark "lady".
FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to watch your e-mail, without offering the opportunity to see some type of attached parts or to browse the Internet.
It enjoys its five-minute glory in the United States, when Time magazine designates it as one of the products of the year.
In fact, it is more difficult to see him in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek offers a very low monthly price and subscription, which is less than half of what it costs, for example, the iPhone's subscription date.
In view of its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free living data service, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's as limited as his American grandfather, but it's a surprise.
The monthly subscription price, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it is to give up the data when they cross a border or desperately looking for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult their mail.
The idea of a fixed roaming price is incredibly seductive and it's been going to work for a long time.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have made a physical thesis to understand them and good glasses to read the small characters.
The repeated reminders by the European Commission to propose affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a painful effect.
Outside of his country of origin, we are reluctant to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device such as FonPeek (it's always curious that it's called Fon while it doesn't have Wifi) offers this type of tariff, meaning that operators start thinking differently and study various proposals to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other Internet research.
No subscription and no gallery.
It is a connected device and is paid at the time of its purchase and not every month.
And that is what I hope to see one day for FonPeek: a life-access option like Peek already offers it to the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it's a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer presenting the same system.
The preferred colour of Michelle
The yellow is undoubtedly the preferred color of the first woman in the United States.
If she went to Barack Obama's office to the presidency of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, she chose the same to accompany her at the second moment, no doubt the most important of her life: the surrender to Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow pulling green with brilliant reflectors, twice, the dress consisted of three parts: the dress, the dress and the coat, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large embroidery or necklace.
As for the first look, it would seem that the first woman in the United States followed the silence of the Princess of Asturias and chose to return the same tenure.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If it was a thick tooth, on the other hand, she would bring Oslo a printed velvet.
The accessories are also different: medium-sized green shoes for the first time, and a similar but golden model, this time.
She also changed hairstyle: hair is now detected while she was wearing them both before.
75 per cent of working mothers have had occupational problems due to their motherhood
Labour discrimination has increased in recent years, especially for women of young generations who want to be mothers.
This is what the study "Women's Fecundity and Professional Career in Spain" carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey, conducted by 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no doubt as to whether 75 per cent of the working mothers have seen their career limited due to maternity.
The study shows that there are many differences regarding the start of married life and the number of children, whether women work or not, and the type of employment employed.
Those who do not have activity outside the home, work part-time or have little stable work, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are retiring in marriage and first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of age have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after being installed in a couple. This figure goes to 4.1 among those who work in the public sector. "These data show that women who have stable employment have needed more time in their lives to get it, which has led them to abandon the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised greatly influences maternity, but less the start date of common life," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another factor that increases the gap between the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, those who conducted elementary and higher studies were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years of age on average.
"Another distinuation also appears among women, depending on their level of study.
While those who have performed elementary studies marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have conducted middle- or higher-level studies invest this program and give priority to getting a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Ms. Delgado.
Diane Kruger also deserves it.
The Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will incarnate the image of several products of the brand, enchanting the universal currency "Because I like it well".
The protagonist of Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actors in the international scene, has thus joined other celebrities registered at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelesta, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if selected were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
In men, the cosmetic brand also includes luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
The prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say in the world of fashion.
Its largest representatives, creators and mannequins, both yesterday and today, met for the annual redistribution of their prices, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed your meeting.
Former Mannequin Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best Mannequin of the year.
Manuel Vincent's Aces Poker
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poker of Aces (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) a dozen "radiographies" of writers who have spent their literary life (and sometimes their other life).
It does not do so according to the foreseeable and understood genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the character's insignia core.
The trip is exciting and Vincent doesn't save neither the friars nor the lights.
Delightful, this book is also an exciting invitation to reading and reading.
I'll leave you here a few minutes.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I found that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical pulse, the same that I felt without the name: pleasure against the funstery destiny, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegoric Christian, wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between impotentness and ignorance, with a poetic humour that bleating, bleating with sense, like the blade of the knife that failed to kill him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in the flesh of which he shared the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that was to reach heaven by the way of destruction."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of eight thousand metres of universal literature, which has to be recorded by the northern front, on which the best climbers are still and always taken."
On William Faulkner: "It was a strange guy.
For himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a landowner of the county and other times that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
These two dreams were of great size. ”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer gathered the demented cry from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo to the end of the 20th century, in its literary form, and made it in the flight of himself and calling for posteriority with a violent speech to the astics."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneels down and prays: "God bless, I beg you to make me stop writing as a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave the faces of Spencer were engraved: "The sleep after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after life, fatigued death."
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband agreed very normally that she told her that Edward VII was a spy among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man as patient and loving as a nervous person whose literary talent surpassed madness."
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do if it's not trying to dissipate Joyce at Baroja?
What if it's not to shoot Baroja by Faulkner?
What did this do if it is not to acquire the glory of this man for him to serve as a pedestal?"
A Release of Aggression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood in Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed next to her and our dog, a blood-stained, saved from SPA and weighed no more than six kilos, and without a word, they took two toes that left the dog severely injured.
Our anger is immense because we don't see what's fun to attack a little animal free of charge that was left behind.
It must be added to this the indignation of a woman who walked quietly and who, when she scorned these individuals, became afraid of her physical integrity, because an energy that attacks an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, anyone less than him.
The episode took place about 5:00 a.m., one Tuesday like another, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog's been chewing all day.
We have heard a complaint from the district commissioner, even if we suspect that this is very important and not to touch the sensitivity, we just want to make it clear that the killings were Spanish.
Angryness has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening in young people so that they find it fun to abuse a defenseless animal that gives us affection, friendship and company.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and people has been.
Michelin and Fesvial, together for the port of the helmet
The Michelin tyre manufacturer, in collaboration with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage the port of the helmet, mainly among the younger motorcyclists, as both structures have said today.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of the port of the helmet, since it is the only protection element to prevent injuries to the head, or even death, in the event of an accident in two wheels.
Michelin stated that this campaign was in line with his commitment to road safety, which "is beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products" and stated that it was contributing to this objective through other educational and information activities.
This new campaign to encourage the port of the helmet in two wheels, under the currency "To be or not to be", will include a first phase during which the posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages to ensure its widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since as a manufacturer of two-wheel vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
The sale of small commercial vehicles is progressing
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6 per cent compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the master trade union of the Anfac and Ganvam manufacturers, the dealer.
However, the good news should be mentioned, as the reference to the comparison, November 2008, was particularly bad, with a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
Consequently, despite the rebound of the last month, the accumulated registrations in those 11 months are 40 % below those in the previous year.
Since January, if all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles (tourism cars, pick-up, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95 853 were sold.
The large clouds that affect their most demand are not so dissipated; in fact, although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions on bank credit limitation, other factors such as the increase in unemployment rates or the persistence of the bad economic situation need to be added.
In view of this situation and the difference between tourism vehicles, aid for the purchase of 2000E has not been used.
In addition to individuals, independent and SMEs wishing to buy a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, they can also benefit from it, but the number of operations speaks of themselves.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, we recalled the need for administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (camps and buses).
The association of dealers provides for a 2010 year similar to that which ends, for which it calculates a 19% decrease in sales (tourism vehicles and 4x4).
Emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As this took place with the ABS brake blocking system and as it will take place with the control of the stability of the ESP, emergency braking systems will be an essential element of European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of deficiency has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure imposed by the European Union is aimed at strengthening pedestrian protection, although it can also help to avoid many rear shocks by its way of action.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency detected by the system by the driver at the foot.
But the latter still doesn't keep the pressure to the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of vehicle components Bosch, one third of the drivers involved in an accident were unable to rely on the brake before the collision, and half of them did not benefit from all its strength.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in return, requires the maximum brake system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of element, up to 1 100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided every year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that a disaster on four with injured people would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, by means of a radar or camera, detects obstacles and prevents the driver from acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not respond, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors rejects the plan for Opel until January
While the workers of the factory Opel de Figueruelas (Saragosse) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably 8 – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that it would need more time to complete the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, believes that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until early 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, a decision on Saab's sale should be made in the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has put pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as quickly as possible.
GM admits to being in touch with potential new buyers.
One of them might be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the Dutch manufacturer's candidacy of Skype sports cars, supported by the Russian Converg group, is of great importance.
In case there would be no agreement with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Baic Chinese company.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
On the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their latest and precious jewelry, Porsche engineers left the Boxster S and managed to reach nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance to only 1 275 kilos.
This led them to move, first of all, from the automatic roof that was replaced by a hand-held roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminium doors such as GT3, 15 other kilos less, to remove the air-conditioning, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of winners, to mount sports bags, another 12 kilos, and with light tyres of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they turned down the CDR-30 audio system, thus winning six other kilograms and replacing the handles with the handles of fabrics, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the double-deck PDK box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on the trails of the California secondary network, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His conduct can only be irrevocable.
The weight reduction does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: it has been a long time since we had not tested such a small and lightweight model that at the same time guarantees so much safety in the turns, including at high speed.
He's a little athlete, able to burn his little muscle speed during the necessary time, until we asked him to sprint, slow down, recover and push his motor again...
That's what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as precise as it says, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the steering wheel.
And she'll do it with a surgical precision.
Voluntary engine sound
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be reinforced with the "sport" option or by a system that changes engine roughness, already used on the Panama.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether in arrest or in recovery.
The suspensions are closed, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The cover of the roads we traveled with the Boyxster Spyder was pretty low, but the car managed well with the chicken nests.
Electronic assistants barely make a presence on the whole route, while on some turns we found the mirror in the morning and the engravings later in the morning.
In the end, an ultra-light car, the most fun driving and it is much more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, at a price of EUR 70,831.
“ Back Girl ”
Karl Lagerfeld's intimate friend, Coco Coco Cocoon's icon and casual starlet of the house's parades, the singer displays her bad girl's face with as much content as her Chanel bags.
More than a "Bad Girl" or "It Girl" is a "Bag Girl".
Basconia offers a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral won a 91-82 victory on its visit to the hard terrain of Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by the Dusko Ivanovic team. It is thus at the head of its group, after Mirza Teletovic's great show, which, with eight banners to three points, was the best of its team (29 evaluations).
Vitoria's team has managed to complete the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of commitment and collective work, even if it had to wait until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 banners with three points marked, largely determines the final victory.
The game began quickly for the blues and reds, which took advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four banners of the Vitoria team were marked since the perimeter led them to predict that they had jumped on the Israeli field with the hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main artisans of the 18-20th end of the first quarter.
The second quarter-time was on the same tone, but the Alava team chose the inner game of Barak and Elijahhu's work, which was received by invitations and applause to his former home, to increase their benefit to rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to make himself the best player of his team, with 13 points marked, although the "less than six" of Splitter's assessment had already made it clear that this night was not the best of Brazil.
But in this game, despite being on the right track to rest, nothing was played, far away, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria that we didn't get so easily on their ground, and thanks to "Elias' hand", they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the advantage of the yellow on the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, injured but far from being dead, needed to channel some skilled action to take the air, and it was at this time that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun, which, with three consecutive panels and the help of English and Ribas, sent the counter to a reassuring score (54-67), and that the premises were able to accentuate at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Avala's team went out to play everything at all during the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they were not going to let anyone take what they had earned during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support it from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for mistakes, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defend well, and although the Israelis were getting closer in the last minute (80-85), the party was already played and the victory escaped to Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
The wounds prevent Unicja from delivering a battle
Unicaja lost in Greece in the face of Olympiacos and gave her the head of Group B of the Euroligue, during a match marked by the absences of Unicaja players, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team has not been discouraged by the atmosphere of the flagship of Peace and Friendship or by the vastness of the rival, no doubt one of Europe's most powerful and budgeted.
The game of the first quarter, led to the dream of the Andalusian. An aggressive defense and three posters at three consecutive points, two of the manager Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who circled the local team 12-18 at the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the local team's arsenal with the internal game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to reverse the score 22-20 at the 13th minute, when an action, a start of baggage, between the North American minors Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to function by showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit to hurt the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez weighed on Unicaja.
The internal players and Lithuanian eagle Linas Kleizas, with their three-point banners, increased the advantage 44-32 at the nineteenth minute.
An impossible upgrade
The third period was particularly offensive for Olympiacos, which, despite the 19 losses, was shown to be higher and even equal to the difference in the meeting held in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, causing the group's head to be cancelled.
Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, three-point panels of Cook, and Lewis' support, left a little hope with 66-57, at thirty-one minutes.
But victory was almost impossible because Olympiacos proved implacable when the players pressed and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, successful to raise the score at 81-62, at the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submits, accepting the victory of Olympiacos.
How much should you pay for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would earn according to their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of small real estate, employment and vehicles in Spain.
The "How much should you be paid?" tool calculates the salaries of users from more than 140,000 jobs offered by Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
Since one week of application, the research engine has found that, as a general rule, the Spanish worker "suffers badly", explained in a communiqué the responsible for the products of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to data available from Trovità from its research engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the least paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 euros per year and a French, 31,059, while a Spanish receives 24 000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives EUR 34 247 per year in England, EUR 25 751 in France and EUR 16 420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the minimum paid work in Spain is that of the server, with 11,592 euro per year, followed by the seller, with EUR 14,725, and that of the worker, with EUR 15,667.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are drivers, middle-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a time limit for Manuel Zelaya's stay in his Embassy of Tegucigalpa.
The vice-chairman will have to leave the diplomatic league no later than 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, the business officer of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed on TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been refugees since 21 September, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27th, following his mandate, he must seek another destination."
The chain also quoted the former envoy, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the appointed time: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the 29 November elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured him that he would remain in the Embassy of Brazil until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, as Zelaya refused the political exhilarating condition that he was meant to impose on him the government actually presided over by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you so much.
After days of roses since last spring, during which the inflation of the assets has been the dominant mark on the markets, uncertainty arises again, which is not surprising because it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about a future by uncertain nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilise markets was to money debt through direct acquisition of assets and indirectly by providing abundant liquidity at close zero rates so that financial institutions would buy assets to mobilize.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct acquisitions of assets have been almost completed and, without challenging their non-conformity policy, they start putting a little sand in the wheels, as the ECB has done, with their award to one year next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are seeing a reverse reduction in risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the deviations from business obligations are increasing again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
Once again, there is a shift towards quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the investors' chosen shelters, leading to an increase in the differences between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was severely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor'sa threatened a new revision to the decline in the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad in order to discourage moral risk defenders, who were trying again to raise awareness among the world economic policy leaders who had stopped the destructive effects of the limitation of the credit on the destruction of employment, whereas what should be done is to decree a new day of action of grace.
However, the situation in Dubai seems to be a trivial struggle between the emirs to restore its place to power in the emirs and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that dissipates a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot to the roses.
I sold it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be totally irrational for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro area Member State to fail to meet its commitments.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and has made its citizens responsible for the need for special measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are facing an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after a few excessive positions, this would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt gap increases to the extent of European business obligations, we do not have to worry.
If European differences were to decrease and ours continued to increase, it would then be a Spanish idiosyncrasic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdotes. When our predictive indicators force most study services to anticipate their recovery models and to review their forecasts upwards for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, which come back to charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not open much hope for their warning.
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though for the moment "precious is mother of care".
Connected sectors
The President of Iberdola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday in front of the Congress Sub-Commission of Members, where the energy strategy of Spain is discussed these days for the next two decades.
After his intervention, which was followed by the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán called for the press what he had referred to before the subcommission at eight o'clock.
For the President of Iberdola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 000 million by 2020 and EUR 60 000 million more between that date and 2030, if nuclear power plants are to remain open today.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60,000 million but to 95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola considers that for the next decade investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
As of 2020, the issue changes, and power needs to be increased.
Its pari focuses both on the gas and coal plants, with mechanisms for recovery of carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this regard, it considers that more 18 000 MW are needed, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that the government has just approved is in line with what its company claims, did not wish to attack the Royal Decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat climate warming.
According to him, there is "a clear long-term parity" in this sense, despite the "point-to-point" measures, as the President of Iberdola described them.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that the decisions to invest, although they are in the long term, must begin to be taken because they take some time before they reach maturity and that a stable remuneration framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins the Air Lingus maintenance market in ten airports
Swiss company Swissport, subsidiary of Ferrovial for ground airport services, will play the privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, has a period of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Board of Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaboration protocol yesterday to create the Centre for the Innovation of Smart Infrastructures.
The agreement provides for an investment of 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to conduct energy efficiency research on highways and airports.
Actiona disputes its first highway in Australia in Hochtifif and Bouygues
Actiona fights for its first concession highway in Australia, a market on which it already works as an energy company and a water manager.
The construction site is an estimated $1,700 million Australian (approximately €1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtifif are its rivals.
A tunnel of 5 kilometres long in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, is the option to allow Actiona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and car dealer.
The mayor of the city wishes to be able to make it available for the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to conduct the project, within the framework of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the payroll.
In anticipation of their bids in May, the planned investment amounted to $1,700 million in Australia (about EUR 1,047 million) and in the last phase three consortia, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The baptized Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in luxury, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second, located in Italy, is one of the largest European underground specialists.
Against the Actiona team, the Northern Direct consortium was built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, the capital of which is shared between the Australian Lighton ( branch of the German manufacturer Hochtifif, which has its own participation in the ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gallois company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large buildings and privatisations, but entering it is a great challenge if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that has followed Hochtif and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and remains an un valid step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
The ACS has just won a position on this market by its participation of 30% in Hochtifif, owner of Lighton.
Monetary assets
It has taken action on a geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a wide presence through its energy supplier activity and in the decommissioning sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and manages the group of companies responsible for raising and managing Adelaide deelinizers, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and benefit from synergies to enter the infrastructure development and management markets.
The underground road, promoted by the Infrastructure Office of the city of Brisbane and the Northern Link (north link), is called to link Toowong's western highway to the peripheral road in Kelvin Grove (see map), 4 kilometres of tunnel. It is the largest project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The schedule established by the Administration indicates that the award will take place during summer 2010 and that the work will begin in December next year.
Despite the fact that this route will be opened at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the construction will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will comprise twice a second route, an electronic pay system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will make 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million) for its financing.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtifif
Australia continues to make Hochtifift widely fruitful, which mentioned yesterday the acquisition of a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
The company held by ACS will, through its Leighton local branch, equip the infrastructure of the national high-voltage fibre network.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have rapid Internet access and will provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has given up the King George tour project from 27 floors in the city of Brisbane. The work has not yet started and Hochtifi has completed the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, more specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is expected to allocate a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its Alpine branch, is responsible for the construction of a tunnel of 2.1 kilometres long for a motorway in Slovenia, amounting to EUR 64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after having been responsible for the expansion work of the Bosruck tunnel, Austria, for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the site is scheduled for early 2010 and its implementation will take 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore saw the advertising of Renfe
Renfe has provided advertising and marketing services for the next two years to Ms. Rushmore, for a budget of approximately three million euros a year, has indicated the railway operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been chosen from 16 agencies that have submitted to Renfe's call for tender, four of which have been finalists, including TBWA, who has been responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of campaigns.
A fine of 63 million in France Telecom to stop competition
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of EUR 63 million in France Telecom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region of the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephone by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and programs of loyalty to consumers outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company, has accumulated more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, due to the obstacles it has placed on its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was increased because the competition authority considers that France Telecom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore reciprocated.
A store of applications
On the other hand, the French company's mobile phone branch has followed other operators and opened a web application store with a view to increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
At the beginning, the Orange application shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait for 2010 to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the League of Champions has reported 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
In fact, Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have won 467,4 million, which puts them in the third and fifth positions of the clubs that have put the most money in this competition.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Gaining the UEFA Champions League does not only bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for major clubs.
In fact, the competition allocated EUR 5 362.5 million to 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament during the 1992-1993 season, according to the information provided by the UEFA.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The White Club was the third of the continent to touch the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, has won the trophee three times.
The Catalan club, currently under the title and the last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is the fifth on the list.
The Manchester United and the Bayern of Munich are listed in the list, the two teams who also billed the most money for their participation in the last League of Champions.
And that, although they lost in front of Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with regard to the money reported by the League of Champions, although it has won more titles than anyone else (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for the distribution of money applied by the UEFA.
For this year, Michel Platini's agency plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the League of Champions.
Of this amount, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification games (including the Madrid Athletic) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who have managed to participate have received only 3.8 million to be there, in addition to EUR 550 00 for each contest.
There is also a bonus in the case of victory (EUR 800,000) and equality (EUR 400,000 for each team). Those who arrive at the eighth end receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive at the fourth end receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will receive 4 million each.
And the champion will win 9 million, against 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, for fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça has captured 2.5 million to win the European Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, which are devoted to 337,8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important and has four attractive places.
The previous year's champion was 40 per cent of the money, 30 per cent for the second, 20 per cent for the third and 10 per cent for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played during the current year's edition.
New Rumasa offers EUR 61 million for 29.9% of Sos.
The New Rumasa Group listed yesterday the details of the offer of purchases of shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos capital.
A percentage that does not force it to launch a public procurement offer (OPA) for the whole of the securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share, which will be paid in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this report.
Sos's shares ended yesterday at EUR 1.85 ; New Rumasa's offer therefore evaluates the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects Sos' actual assessment.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jerez Group gives a 15-day period for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
The CNMV made sure that it had not been informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos' company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If so, the depreciation would amount to 611.7 million, while Sos capital is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos pursues the restructuring of his direction.
In an attempt to stay out of any bids for purchases and go and come judges from his former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that is actually the first woman to occupy a position in the food business.
This is a newly created position which will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not free of controversy, as the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Furthermore, the possibility that in the next few months His disclosure of new fund failures cannot be excluded.
With regard to credit to Salazar, former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) stated yesterday before the national hearing that they had been informed of the departure of 212 million without knowing the destination.
NCMV authorizes Fatherina’s Exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) approved yesterday the OPA exemption presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paterina on 9 October.
The supervisory body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with the applicable standards and that it considered the content of the explanatory sheet submitted as a result of the amendments made on 2 December.
The CNMV stated that the offer concerned the acquisition of 550 008 shares by Federico Paterina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95 per cent of the social capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to negotiations on the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592 778 million shares were immobilized and could not be transmitted in any way before the end of the offer, indicating that the price had been fixed by Federico Paterina, in accordance with the rules in force.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have been hit by a crash are brought back to a garage, where an expert has to assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of parts and working time can be a long and complex work.
Calculate by hand the cost of a repair of between EUR 20,000 and EUR 30,000, including the parts and the work hand can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the latest computer tools, this would be a matter of minutes.
For this reason, almost 100% of experts use this type of systems.
Providers of services and solutions for disaster assessment and maintenance devote themselves to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then treating them and offering them to their clients in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Auditex, of the North American Group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies in competition in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, although over the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car goes off the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very hard work, because each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle must be cataloged and recorded.
In addition, a "intelligent" graphic image of each model can be used to click on the different parts of a tourism car.
In the case of a model sold massively, work can be prepared in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
In the case of a small car sold, this can take three or four months. At present, Auditex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have information about Porsche, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In the case of vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99 %.
In order to carry out the documentation and development of databases, Auditex has eight centres across the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in certain brands.
The national seat is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (in general from mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Auditex invests 90 million each year to develop these databases.
Each month 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and to offer various products.
The most frequent application concerns repair and maintenance, but according to countries, there are also tools for handling parts of the case or to calculate the venereal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide to the value of opportunity cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Auditex does not propose it in our country, but it does so in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Auditex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the leading product being AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution for experts.
There are cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or paint bars.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is €5.75 for low-cost customers up to 10 times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which carries out thousands of experts, negotiates its price with Audetex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it comes out of the assembly chain, only through its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle windows, and AudaSubbastas is a server open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows to load on declared vehicles.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, carry out geo-demographic analyses or know current problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a particular brand have gone to the garage for a bread or how many have suffered severe shocks for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It commercialises, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the official parts, prices and time of the manufacturer.

Internet auctions of injured cars
Last October, the Solera Group purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and specialty vehicles.
The transaction involves a cost of EUR 59.5 million for 85 per cent of the capital of the company, which could extend next year to the remaining 15 per cent.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This estimate and sales service is exclusively addressed to sector professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cash registers and professional vendors that need to be registered before they start carrying out operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 sellers and 4,000 experts registered on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to the Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but on the other hand, some parts that are not absorbed can be used as spare parts.
Collection cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed, after complex approaches.
Garage unit in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audetex company ensures that the user gets a currency in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, looking for the spare part, creating a currency and generating it.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially in order to convince older professionals that, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109 land, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, a computer and Internet connection are needed.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the required part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of the hand of work, increases or reductions, and then he can print the device to return it to the client.
AudaTaller is not an estimate tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include the estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is EUR 350 per year, which can be credited.
At present, the Audetex company works to make these images three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, as it will, for example, allow them to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
