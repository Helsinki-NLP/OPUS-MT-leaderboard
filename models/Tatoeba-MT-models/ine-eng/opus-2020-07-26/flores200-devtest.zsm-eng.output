In addition, failure to do so is a serious consequence: depression, unbalanced diet, and death.

On the other hand, food (sweets, eggs, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but it provides high-quality protein containing all important amino acids.
All of this is taken into consideration, we should not be surprised if our ancestors are overcoming their protein problems in the same way that the savanna has done today.
