Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they may feel that they are "mariones"
Several members of the National Assembly of Wales are concurred because they have been suggested to change their title, respectively to be called MWP (members of the Parliament of Wales).
This problem has been caused by plans to change the name of the Assembly of Wales.
The members of the National Assembly of Wales present on the political stage are afraid that this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party of the National Assembly of Wales is concerned that he "remains with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside the Gale Country: in Galeese, "twp" means "obtuz" and "pwp" means "feal matter".
A member of the Party of Wales of the National Assembly of Wales said that the group "is not pleased" and suggested alternative.
A member of the Conservative Party said that the group had an "open" attitude towards the change of name, but that it also observed that "MWP" is similar to "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is spoken in the Galician State as the English-speaking letter "u" in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing the legislation to change its name, said: "The final decision on how to appoint members of the Assembly will certainly depend even on those members."
The Law of 2017 on the Government of the Gali Country offered the Assembly the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which made it clear that many of them wish to use the "Parliament of Wales".
With regard to the title of the members of the National Assembly of Wales, the Commission preferred "members of Parliament of Wales" or "WMP", but the "MWP" option received the most votes in the public consultation.
It seems that members of the National Assembly of Wales have suggested alternative options, but attempting to reach consensus could give Elin Jones, chairman of the Steering Committee, who is expected to send the draft law on amendments in a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes in the way of the assembly, including rules on the decalibration of members and the structure of the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly will have the last word in terms of their title when the law is being debated.
Macedonians vote for the referendum on the change of country name
This Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their opinion on changing their country's name to the "North Macedonian Republic".
The popular vote was organized to resolve an old dispute with Greece, the neighboring country, which has its own province, Macedonia.
The Athens government has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim about its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a fierce opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would not take this vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that changing the name is just a compromise that will allow them to join the EU and NATO.
The bishops of St. Martin's church stopped beating as a result of the problems that the churches in Harlem face.
"In historical terms, the veterans of the place I was talking to told me that before, you found a bar and a church on every corner of the street," Adams said.
"Today, there are no bars and churches."
He also said the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are socializing otherwise today," he said.
"Bars no longer have the role of living room for the entire neighborhood, where people usually hang out."
And with regard to the churches, it is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will be spent faster than the leaders expected and that, " sooner or later, the dissident will be the same".
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums filled with people who would not support the remains of the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "so this will accelerate the closing of churches, as it is unlikely that many of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of those churches."
Both churches were built by white-colored congregations before Harlem became a metropolis of African-American people – St. Martin’s Metropolitan Community in 1870, after a decade.
The original Methodist Congregation, formed of white people, moved from that area after 1930.
A congregation of African - American people, who carried out religious activities nearby, took over the building.
Church of St. Martin was taken over by an African-American congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted merchants from 125th Street, a main street for purchases in Harlem, which opposed the engagement or promotion of African-American people.
A fire that took place in 1939 affected the building a lot, but the proud parents of Johnson made plans to rebuild it and included the carilon in it.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's church, named the carilon "the clopotes of poor people".
The expert who put the carilon into operation in July described it differently: "a cultural eater" and "an unplaced historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also stated that it was the first carilon in the world to be performed by an African-American musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger carilon, to Riverside church, 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced by St. Martin.
What St. Martin heard in the last few months was a complicated story, which included architects and contractors, some brought by church deacons, others by the bishop diocese.
The priesthood, the government of the parish, formed of deacons, wrote diocese in July to complain that the diocese "was seeking to pass the costs" to the priesthood, even though it was not involved in the engagement of architects and contractors sent by diocese.
Some of the winners complained about the lack of transparency that proved diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old child trying to catch lobsters in California
According to the authorities, on Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old child while she was swimming, trying to catch lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the lobster season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m., near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said for the post of the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was swimming for about half an hour, along with his friends, on the morning of Saturday, when he heard a boy screaming for help and then moved along with a group that helped him get him out of the water.
Hammel said that, initially, he thought the boy was glad he caught a lobster, but then he realized that the call "He bit me!
He bit me!"
The whole clavicle was over, Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I cried out to all those who were in the water and told them to get out of the water: "There is a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was taken with the helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is not known.
Salvamar, Captain Larry Giles, said at a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks ago, but concluded that it is not a species of shark that is a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma at the top of the trunk.
Authorities have restricted access from the Ponto beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons .
Giles also mentioned that there are more than 135 species of sharks in that area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury retailer plans to strengthen its position on the market for beauty products and fashion in the UK
Sainsbury preia Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams, making available districts with decoration products in the style of a universal store, with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a position-building in the UK market for beauty products, worth 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow, although domestic and fashion products sales are not in measure, the larger areas with beauty products will be tested in 11 country stores and will be integrated into more magazines next year, if they prove to be successful.
The investment in the beauty industry comes in the context of which supermarkets are looking for a way to use the previous space for television, microwaves and household products.
The representatives of the retailer Sainsbury said that the number of beauty products he offers will be doubled, reaching up to 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas, similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket also rekindles its range of makeup products, Boutique, which means that most products are intended for vegan people, a demand that is increasingly met among young buyers.
In addition, the products of the French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two stores of the Sainsbury chain, for testing purposes, the first being open last week in Croydon, south of London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second part of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food every day from the nearest food store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of the Sainsbury retailer, said that the outlets will increasingly appear as universal stores, because supermarket chains are trying to cope with the fight against large retail stores, Aldi and Lidl, which provide more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury has included both Argo's outlet products in hundreds of stores as well as Habitats, since it purchased both chains two years ago, which means it recorded increases in food sales, as well as increased profits.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to resupply its pharmaceutical and pleasing parts failed.
Sainsbury tried to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but the negotiations ended after a divergence on how to share the revenues of Boots stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was conceived after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business including 281 stores, Celesio company, which holds Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds, three years ago.
This means that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding an extended range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four magazines.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of the Sainsbury retailer, said: “I have transformed the appearance of our regions with pleasing products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specialized training of our colleagues, who will be available to offer you advice.
Our range of brands can be adapted to all needs, and the attractive environment and suitable locations turn us into an extraordinary location to purchase beauty products, revolutionizing the old way to make purchases."
Peter Jones is angry after Holly Willoughby retired from a contract of 11 million pounds sterling
The protagonist of the "Dragons' Den" TV show, Peter Jones, is angry after the presentation of the TV Holly Willoughby retired from a contract worth 11 million pounds with his life-style company, to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time to engage in their project regarding the True brand, which includes accessories and household items.
The couple's company was compared to the Goop brand, owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presentation of this morning's show, 37 years old, announced Instagram that it would withdraw.
Holly Willoughby generated Peter Jones' anger, the protagonist of the "Dragons' Den" show, reflecting in the final moment of their business that provides life-style services to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became angry when one of the most loved people on television acknowledged Tuesday, during a tense sitting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, no longer allow her to dedicate their brands, True, which includes accessories and household items.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and almost doubled Willoughby's property, with an estimated 11 million pounds of sterling.
After Willoughby, 37 years old, announced Instagram that he would give up the contract for True, Jones left Britain to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
A source statement: “Truly was one of Holly’s priorities far away.
She had to be her future in the long run for the next two decades.
The decision to withdraw shocked everyone.
No one came to believe what happened on Tuesday, was less until the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at Marlow's headquarters that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that withdrawing the present issue "This Morning", which is one of the best sold out in Britain, could cause the company millions of damage, as a result of investments in products such as feathers and candles, clothing and household items, as well as possible additional delay in launch.
It can also represent the end of a long - distance friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, are ten-year-old friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby set the base of the True brand together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined them as director in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company's shares.
Willoughby will become the M&S ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the ITV's "I'm A Celebrity" show.
A close source of Jones said last night: "We don't want to comment on his business."
I was very hard, and then "I fell in love"
He made a joke about the criticisms he will receive from journalists because he made a comment that some would consider him to be "behind a president" and that he had such a positive attitude with regard to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
Trump said by imitating a voice of "presentator of news".
"I didn't take a step back."
He said Kim was interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as a huge step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearisation have stopped.
At a better than three months since the June Singapore summit, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders from around the world on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not observe a "responsibility" from the United States regarding the previous North Korea's desertion.
On the other hand, it noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions in order to put pressure on it.
Trump had a more optimistic view in his motivational speech.
"Everything goes well with North Korea," he said.
"We are heading towards a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He also said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: stopping rocket tests, supporting the release of hostages and returning US military.
He also defended himself in an unusual way to talk about the relationship with Kim.
"It is easy to behave like a president, but if I were to act like this, instead of the 10,000 people outside, who are trying to enter this invincible arena, would be around 200 people," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and a earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island causing hundreds of deaths
According to the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations have been told that their assistance is not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the population of the island of Lombok has been displaced, a national disaster has not been declared, a condition necessary for the launch of aid actions at international level.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear about not asking for international assistance, so it is a rather difficult situation," Sumbung said.
Although the "Save Children" Foundation is trying to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign personnel are allowed access to the site.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Disasters Agency, said that the authorities in Indonesia evaluate the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to aid efforts.
In view of Indonesia's constant shocks, it is unlikely that the country will continue to be sufficiently prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although shelters for tsunamis have been built in Aceh, they are not very often met on other coasts.
It seems that the lack of a warning siren in the case of tsunamis in Palu, although a warning was issued in this sense, could have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of circumstances, the journey between the islands of Indonesia proves to be a challenge.
Natural disasters make this more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu, but it will last at least three days to reach the place where the new disaster occurred.
President Joko Widodo proposed that the improvement of the pre-industry infrastructure in Indonesia should be the central point of his election campaign and provided money for roads and railways.
But lack of funds has affected Joko's administration, which will take part in a new election campaign next year.
Yoko also faces persistent pressures from the Indonesian sectarians, as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes, as the gangs of Christians and Muslims were on the streets, using masks, bows and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool gives the saving goal and equals score in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League in front of the Chelsea team, with a goal in 89 a.m. on Saturday, at the Stamford Bridge football stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, while it is about 30 meters away from the front team, and his team was led by Chelsea with 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before giving a shot in the direction of the gate.
The ball came up above the one, heading towards the right corner of the gate.
Finally, the ball passed by Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped to her and fell into the gate.
"I should just try to get to the ideal position, get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to get as far ahead as possible, so I tried to get as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn't think much about it, just, I took the ball away."
Chelsea drove 1-0 to the break after Belgian star Eden Hazard marked in 25 minutes.
The blue team's attack sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, and then returned to the middle of the ground and ran to half the Liverpool team's ground.
Kovacic made a quick move of one-two in the middle of the ground.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who went in.
Hazard overdone the defense and sent the ball into space, succeeding to hit it with his left foot and cross the player Alisson Becker from Liverpool.
Liverpool will have a match against the Naples team in the league leagues on Wednesday at 3:00, at the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against the Videoton team at UEFA Europe League Thursday, at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia reached 832
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, according to the national disaster agency, in the morning of Sunday.
Several people were trapped under the ruins of ruined buildings of the magnitude of 7.5 that took place on Friday and that triggered values of up to 6 meters, said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, was covered by the remains caused by the collapse of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man, suspected of murdering a woman by injection
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The woman, at 44, was found at 7:55 in the morning, with injuries caused by stabbing, at Grayson Mews, on John Street, and a man suspected of murder was arrested.
The police have asked the people in the area who have heard or seen anything about this subject to come to the statement section.

I also want to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded any useful materials with the help of the room on board to contact us if they have essential information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belongs to a woman in Birkenhead and was found on a property.
This afternoon, at the scene of the murder, a few people came who think I know a woman to ask questions about where she was found in the morning.
The investigation is underway, and the police have said they are trying to inform the victims.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to get back to his apartment, but he was told by the police that no one is allowed into the building.
He was shocked when he found out what happened.

Cromwell's Parliament statue becomes the most recent commemorative monument affected by the altercations on "rewriting history"
This removal would represent a poetic justice for the destruction in the Taliban of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, carried out by its followers, fanatic Puritans.
But Cromwell described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "a fool" and "an attempt to rewriting history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell’s Society, said: “It was inevitable in the present debate on the removal of the statues as the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace to become a target.
The English Civil War Iconclass was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe a wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for his uncle Thomas' actions in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the 19th century's opinion and part of the story of a figure that many think deserves to celebrate.
Goldsmith stated to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more by the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is an exact representation, this is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
But certainly, the conflict since the middle of the 17th century has led to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized individual figure, which is part of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve celebrated and celebrated."
A pig caused the death of a farmer in China
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local press agencies.
The man, identified only after the name of the "Yuan" family, was found dead after his blood was sectioned and covered, near a pig farm located in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, according to the Sunday editor of the Morning Post in South China.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pigs' vaccines to a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Looks like he came with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby cottage was open.
She said there was a pig in the cottage, a male of large blood sizes at the mouth.
Legal doctors confirmed that a pig of about 300 kg caused the death of the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's feet were full of blood and snorkels," said the cousin, whose family name is "Wu", for Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed their pigs.
After about an hour, his body was found.
The animal that caused man's death did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A market representative said to Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent him from attacking someone else, while the police narrowed evidence from the crime scene.
The Yuan family and authorities seem to negotiate compensation for its death.
Although rare, cases of pigs have been reported that have attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, as a result of a 300 kg pig, a man in the Gali Country was stuck in his tractor until his wife came to scare and pull the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but blood taste can trigger such reactions."
‘It’s just playing.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to get them proper respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa, which has lost its intensity, will cause torrential rains in the south-west of the United States
As recommended, Hurricane Rosa loses its intensity as it moves to the coldest waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain that will cause floods in northern Mexico and in the south-west of the United States in the following days.
Rosa records wind conditions at a speed of 85 km/h, being a Category 1 hurricane Sunday from 5 a.m. and was located approximately 600 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will arrive in the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depressing area across the Pacific Ocean began to be formed and moved east toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula, months, in the form of a tropical storm, will begin to push intense tropical humidity north-west of the United States.
Monday, Rosa will bring precipitations up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical humidity that will interact with the depression zone will generate abundant rain in the southwest in the following days.
Local, precipitations between 3 and 10 cm will cause dangerous rapid floods, waste streams and possibly desert terrain.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates of up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in some parts of south Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation of between 5 and 10 cm in the south-west, especially in most Arizona, is expected.
Fast floods may occur due to rapid deterioration conditions as a result of the nature of the tropic rain.
It is not recommended to venture into the desert on the ground in view of the threat posed by tropical rain.
The mighty rain may cause the canyons to turn into violent rivers, and the storms will bring local winds to the reefs and dust.
The depressing zone approaching will bring torrential rain to the areas on the southern coast of California.
Precipitation of about 2 cm is possible, which could result in minor flows of alunacous waste and roads.
They will be the first precipitations in the region in the wet season.
The scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the second part of Sunday and in the first part of the month, before the rain spreads more months night and Tuesday.
The intense precipitations will spread in so-called "four corners" on Tuesday and will persist until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes in the U.S. will occur, as the Arctic region will get colder, but the tropicals remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature at short distances.
On Sunday, dramatic temperature differences are encountered at the U.S. central area level.
There is a temperature difference of about 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the extended heat of the summer will try to form and expand again.
A large part of the central and eastern US is expected to face a hot October start, with temperatures up to 27 degrees in extended areas, from the south to certain portions of the north-east.
Tuesday, New York City could reach 27 degrees, with about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates high chances of temperatures above average for the US east until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have followed Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people have followed the press statement supported by the candidate at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of a sexual attack that was alleged to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, the political confrontation continued, TV stations interrupting the normal Friday program for a news of the last hour: an agreement between Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona to conduct an investigation by the FBI for a week.
Ford told the jury that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had cheated her while she was in a state of drunkenness and that he had tried to expose her to a high school party.
Kavanaugh, as part of an intense witness, said it's 100% sure this didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people would have been followed up by Friday's hearing.
The company counted average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen's usually having trouble controversing people who see from the office.
To put this into perspective, this audience is similar to that for a play-off football game or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh's name, it was in front of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the daily hearing.
The ABC was in second place, with a total of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS was tracked by 3.1 million people, NBC of 2.94 million, MSNBC of 2.89 million, and CNN of 2.52 million.
The interest remained at a high level after the hearing.
Flake was in the middle of Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by the CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning while the protestors shouted at him and he was trying to get into an elevator at a meeting of the Judicial Committee.
He was looking down for a few minutes while people were arguing about it, and everything was broadcast directly to the CNN.
"I'm right here, in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling us the truth?
She was told, "You are powerful, while so many women are invincible."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before closing the elevator, that he would have more to say at the committee's meeting.
Televisions later broadcast the vote directly within the Judicial Committee to advance the nomination of Kavanaugh for the Senate vote.
But Flake said he'd only do this if the FBI agreed to analyse the charges against the nominee next week, which is required by minority democracies.
Flake was largely convinced of talks with his friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and several senators after that.
Flake's election was an important one, as it is clear that the Republicans would not have the votes necessary to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Accused Critics of "political Games" About Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" with the future of Britain and submining national interests in an interview for Sunday Times.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of Britain, participated in the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
Another interview that is next to his photo on the first page of the paper, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, issued an attack on his plan for Brexit, so-called Chequers plan, saying the proposal that the UK and the European Union collect each other's tariffs was "completely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims' shot: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of having shot the LSU player mortally.
The police arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player, at the age of 20.
Diteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned at the age of 20, being charged with grade 2 murder in accordance with the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities published the filming of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during his imprisonment.
The police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, affiliated CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police say she recognized that she had shot Wayde dead.
His claim was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Legal Medical Office Baton Rouge published a preliminary report Friday, saying that death was caused by a gunshot through the neck.
The department is due to the Louisiana police force, the state police lab, the South University police and the citizens of the area, for the aid offered in the investigation, which led to the arrest in question.
Athletic director LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police for "diligentness and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The attack with a height of 1.98 m grew in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, played basketball for LSU.
Last season, it marked, on average, 5.6 points and had 2.6 recoverys.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "destroyed" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This thing worries me all the time," Wade said.
A volcano threw a colon of ashes over the city of Mexico City
The Cenuša from the Volcano Popocatepetl arrived in the southern areas of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to keep the distance to the volcano after the event was launched in the crater and 183 gas and ashes were recorded over 24 hours.
The centre monitors several hurricanes and vibrations.
The images on socialization networks presented layers of ashes on car parks in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have observed an increase in volcanic activity at 72 km south-east of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake cleared Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Between the police and Catalan separatists prior to the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the pro-independence protestors spent their lives with Jandarmi, at the first anniversary of the vote for the secession of Catalonia, forcing thousands of opposition demonstrators.
A group of masked pro-separatists kept far away from Jandarmi bombed these eggs and dusty cows, creating dark clouds on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
The warming got worse later, the police using their batons to control the situation.
For a few hours, pro-independence groups shouted "Don't forget, we don't forgive," while Union Protestants shouted "Living Spain!".
14 people received medical care for minor injuries caused during protests, according to local press.
The tensions remain at a high level in the region that wants to become independent one year after the referendum of 1 October was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose, in a comprehensive majority, to become independent, although the vote was reduced, and those against the secession boycotted, in large part, the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 100 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote at polling stations in the region, with violent harassment taking place.
Pro-independence groups camped over Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protestors were forced to choose a new path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of gaining independence from Catalonia.
"Last year I lived some of the most beautiful moments of my life.
I looked at my parents crying for joy that I could vote, but now we don't have anything else to do," he said.
Despite gaining a vital victory, but narrowly, in the regional elections in December last year, the pro-independent Catalan parties tried to maintain the future this year, many of the most well-known leaders either in exile or in detention, waiting for the trial for the role played by the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, said that politicians on both sides fueled the conflict.
"The situation is becoming increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison since the end of last year, announced that he would run for elections for the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for European elections, it is the best way to denounce the return to democratic values and the repression I have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: More men were arrested after entering a house with the car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car entered a Londonderry house several times.
The incident took place on Thursday, about 7:30 p.m. in Ballynagard Crescent.

Looks like at one point, he used an apron against the car.
Menga's hit helped the Livingston team win 1-0 in front of the Rangers team
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensures victory
Livingston left the Rangers team unreputed, Steven Gerrard reaching the second in 18 matches, as the manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's hit proved to make the difference while Gary Holt's team played the same level as Hibernate in the second replay.
Gerrard's team remains without a victory in the Premier League this season and faces the Hearts leaders, behind them with eight points, next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers hosts Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues unbeatable in the division up to six matches, Holt's main coach still feels the taste of defeat, as he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses the chance against the crown visitors
Holt's team had to move ahead a long time before it was registered, and their guidance caused all sorts of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to cross and tried to sneak into the port space, then Alan Lithgow managed to sneak far after he entered through the swing to intercept the ball sent with Craig Halkett's head.
The guests were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could make trouble for visitors at free hits.
And this was the way the crucial goal came.
Rangers accepted a free shot, and Livingston managed an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to take care of Menga, who searched and marked out of the center.
At that stage, Rangers dominated the possession, but he faced the impenetrable defense of the host, and porter Liam Kelly was no longer in great trouble in the rest of the game.
This game model continued in the second replay, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman didn't have any success against Allan McGregor from Rangers, and Lithgov gave a long shot from another player of the Livingston team.
The diagonal steps continued to come into which the Livingston team, but unsuccessfully, and the two requests for penalties - after Halkett broke Glenn Middleton and after a hen - were not accepted.
"Femenal game" offered by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were excellent, except, continuing to exceed expectations on a ascending path.
Their game style and team have not changed since returning to the top, but merit must be given to Holt for how he trained the team since he took it.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga made it difficult for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the party.
But the Rangers weren't too inspired.
Although they've had good performance since they were led by Gerrard, they haven't reached the same standards.
The empty steps were unsuccessful, they succeeded once to capture the port of free opponents, and this should be an alarm signal for Rangers, which is in the middle of the class.
Joint reactions to Erdogan’s visit to Cologne
It was all on Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin to have breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to remedy relations between NATO alliances.
They are not happy about problems such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world outside Turkey.
The police have called for security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from being harassed in front of the mosque, but enough supporters have gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, the majority of the Kursi, heard their voice, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive him with open arms in the country.
The contradiction protests reflect the division of a visitor considered a hero of some of the Turks in Germany and an autocrat of others.
Road accident in Deptford: a biker dies following a collision with a car
A biker died after a collision with a car in London.
The incident took place at the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10:15 a.m.
The car driver stopped, and the paramedics appeared at the site of the accident, but the man died in front of the place.
The accident took place only a few months after another biker died following an accident that took place on Childers Street, where the driver fled from the spot, which is about a mile from the place where the accident happened on Saturday.
Metro police said officers are trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted in that area, the route of buses is diverted, and motorcyclists have been recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured by a riot
Six prison officers were injured as a result of a detention in a high-security prison for men, a prison representative said.
Sunday, a race to the HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire was launched at around 9:30, this being underway.
Specialized officers have been brought to take care of the detention, in which eight prisoners are involved, isolated in an apricot.
Officers were treated on the spot for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesperson for the prison said: “The assistance of the prison’s specialized staff was requested to deal with an incident at the HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical attention after they were injured.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules about those responsible, who will be transferred to the police and could spend a longer period of time after grace."
In the HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 detainees, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, officials dealing with disturbances were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, personnel being attacked with billiards.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded because of the Rosa hurricane (the drought zones can enjoy benefits as a result of this)
There is rarely a tropical depression in Arizona, but this is quite likely to happen at the beginning of next week, because the remaining energy resources of the Rosa hurricane will be used in the south-west desert, presenting a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued rapid flood warnings for months and Tuesday in the west of Arizona, south and east of Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will have a direct route to Phoenix on Tuesday, and on the second day of the month will cause precipitation.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service announced in a Twitter message that "only ten tropical cyclists have maintained a storm or tropical depression at a distance of approximately 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an action hurricane about 60 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Centre for Uruguay predict precipitations between 5 and 10 cm, with quantities isolated up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other areas of the south-west desert, including in the centre of the Stâncoşi and the Great Basin, quantities of between 3 and 5 cm will be recorded, with a total of up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, in certain areas, the torrential rain will be beneficial because the south-west is facing drought problems.
According to the United States Secet Monitor, at least 40% of Arizona is faced with at least one severe Secetite, the second largest category", information on weather.com.
First of all, Hurricane Rosa will take to the ground plains in the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who still had the power of hurricane in the morning of Sunday, with a wind of up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north, 19 km per hour.
The oven will meet colder water in the Pacific and will therefore decrease.
Thus, it is expected that it will produce land dumps in Mexico, with a tropical storm power in the afternoon or the evening of the month.
Torrents in Mexico could be significant, presenting a high flood risk.
"There are expected torrential rains between 8 and 10 cm" from Baja California to the north-west of Sonorei, and can also reach 25 cm", according to weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north, in Mexico, as a tropical storm, before reaching the border with Arizona in the morning of Tuesday, as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and reaching south Utah on the night of Tuesday.
"The danger principle represented by Rosa or her remains is the extreme torrential rain from Baja California, the north-west of Sonore and the south-west of the United States," said a representative of the National Centre for Uruguay.
These rains are expected to produce rough floods, which will endanger people's lives, and will bring waste streams to the deserts, as well as land wells in the mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested as a result of a suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with wounds caused by an injection into Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00.
He was taken to the hospital, where he's in a stable state.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstock area tonight, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
Officials have asked for the help of citizens who might have material on their mobile phone, or to be present at the police station.
Trump said Kavanaugh faced the "unhappiness and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the rude and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump further stated that Kavanaugh faced the "unhappiness and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Thursday, Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress, strongly denying Christine Blasey Ford's statements about having sex with her ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified in the sitting on her statement.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, quality and courage that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the best minds in the legal field of this generation," he told the majority of supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred directly to the nomination of Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the Republic's presence in the interim elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our life.
I'm not running, but, in a way, I'm running," he said.
"For this reason, I express my overall positive opinion on the candidates I consider to be extraordinary."
Trump argued that democracies are in a mission to "resist and obstruct".
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate since the appointment of Kavanaugh will take place by Friday, a GOP-led assistant for the CNN said.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia, the number rising
At least 384 people were killed, many of them being taken over by the huge waves that hit the beaches, when a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities declared Saturday.
Hundreds of people flocked to a festival on the beach in Palu, when waves with a height of six meters hit the beach at amurg, people being taken by water and destroying everything in their way.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-degree earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people still saw their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, becoming such a victim," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesperson of the BNPB disaster mitigation agency, said at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami brought with it cars, tanks, houses, hitting everything on the dry land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled far at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the land.
It added that some people were forced to climb trees to escape tsunamis and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centres in Palu.
The photographs published by the disaster agency present several destroyed buildings and stores, torn and broken bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the replicas continued to wake up the coastal town.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said that the energy emitted by the strong winter earthquake was about 200 times greater than the power of the Atomic Bomb from Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical structure of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow golf course, probably increased the volume of the tsunami, added the representative.
Nugroho described the damage as being "extended" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the wreckage of broken buildings, he said, in addition to the 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and damage could be larger along the coast of 300 km north of Palu, a zone called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were "completely disturbed, without any information" in Dongala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
He added: "This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticized because it did not inform about the fact that a tsunami would hit Palu, although the authorities said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In socialization networks, you can hear a man at the top of a building shouting brake warning that the tsunami is approaching people on the adjacent street.
In a few minutes, a wall of water hits the ground, taking this building and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major interruption of electricity, which blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts by the authorities.
The Army began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuated people still need food and other basic things.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu for Sunday.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800 people.
The situation is extremely serious.
While Word Vision staff from Dongala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees are housed in improvised shelters in the office's court, they passed the devastating scene, said Doseba.
She added: “They told me they saw many houses destroyed. ”
The situation is very serious.
Even though the relief groups have begun to remain in the event of disaster, some people have complained that foreign workers with comprehensive expertise have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to the Indonesian regulations, financial resources, supplies of materials and personnel can only be reached at the place of production of a disaster if declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a province-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"After the government says, 'Yes, this is a national disaster,' we can start international assistance actions, but nothing has been announced yet.
After the second night of the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday in Palu, the lost friends and families hoped that the loved ones would be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
Saturday, a boy was pulled out of a channel.
Sunday, the rescue personnel released a woman who was in ruins for two days, with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the national paragliding team, trained for the Asian Games, which ended at the beginning of this month in Indonesia, two of the missing paragliding pilots.
Other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandadi, were his students.
"In view of the experience in parapet activity, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, a few hours after spreading news about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the community of sports practitioners with paragliding, he sent desperate messages to whatsApp competitors in Palu who participated in the festival organized on the beach.
But in his right message, there was only one grey biffee, and not two blue biffee.
"I think that means the messages were not transmitted," he said.

Kanye West: Rapper changes his scene name to "Ye"
Rapper Kanye West changes his stage name to "Ye".
It made a Saturday announcement on Twitter change: "the official person known as Kanye West".
The West, at the age of 41, is called "Ye" for some time and uses this title as the title of the eighth album, released in June.
This change comes before his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where he expects to launch his new album, Yandhi.
It comes to the show instead of the Ariana Grande singer, who cancelled "for emotional reasons", the producer mentioned the show.
In addition to the fact that it is an abbreviation of the current name of the scene, West said earlier that this word has a religious significance for it.
"I think "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," West said at the beginning of this year, in the discussion about the title of the album with the head of the radio Big Boy.
"Because I am you, I am us, it is about us.
It all started with "Kanye", which means the only one, and it reached "Ye", this being a reflection on our good, bad, nebula and all of it.
The album is more a reflection of what we are as people."
He's one of the most rappers who have chosen to change his scene name.
Sean Combs had countless stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
And a former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, changed his name, sometimes with cream, others without, as well as with large letters.
Mexico President promises not to use military forces against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military forces against civilians, as the country nears the 50th anniversary of a bloody rebate against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that "he will never use the army to repression the Mexican people".
The troops led a peaceful demonstration from the market on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when the left movements of students were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has undertaken to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and by opening several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for IA
While China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and user of artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after more US government members have made announcements about IA, even if there is no official strategy for artificial intelligence in the US.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it proposes to be the first in terms of IA innovation by 2030.
"Dublining the IA research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far more behind the US and that we are looking for the next IA discovery," Lee said.
Duplicate funds could double the chances that next major IA performance would be done in the US, Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Higher IA: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Synovation Ventures, which invested in one of China's leading companies, Face +.
In 1980, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that beat American player Othello, being the best in the field at that time, and later he was executive director of Microsoft Research and the president of the Google branch in China.
Lee appreciated the previous competitions of American governments in the field of technology, such as Robotics Challenge of the Agency's advanced research projects in the field of defence, and asked when it will be next, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government funds, Lee said.
"China doesn't put drinks in the wheels of academic leaders, but corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired outstanding graduates from universities to work at IA in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could help the US intensify its IA efforts.
"I think you should automatically offer a doctoral visa to IA," he said.
The State Council of China issued a New Artificial Intelligence Generation Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Science in China provides financial support to people from academic institutions in a similar way that the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations provide money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of the year, the Department of Defence of the United States set up a Common Centre for Artificial Intelligence, with the aim of involving partners in the field and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a selection commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
This month, the US Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced an investment worth $2 billion for an initiative called "AI Next".
NSF also now invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, there have been no changes in US legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote in referendum if they want to change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum if they wish the country's name to be changed to "the North Macedonia Republic", a change that would resolve an old dispute with Greece for a decade, which opposed its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of the neighbouring country is a claim on its territory and has opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but the opposition nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts about the vote, as it was possible that the minimum limit of 50% would not be reached, necessary for validation of the referendum.
The question on the ballot to the referendum will be: "Do you agree with EU and NATO membership, accepting the agreement with Greece?".
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the destruction of Yugoslavia, in order to be acceptable to entities such as the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the country's future, so that young people in Macedonia live free under the shadow of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a quorum of two-thirds is needed in parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that no irregularities were reported until 13:00.
However, participation was only 16%, compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of those with voting rights were put to the vote.
"I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old, a Skopje voter, the country's capital.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and their son Dushko, voted for the referendum on Macedonia's change of name, which will allow them to join NATO and join the European Union.
In front of the Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, at 54 years of age, prepared a small-scale scene and threw a seat in front of the high courts of those who will boycott the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with the top, not on the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not willing with the name of Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and we can become part of the European Union."
Prime Minister Zaev said joining NATO will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, which has a 20% unemployment rate.
"I think the majority will be in favour of changing the name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of joining NATO and the EU," Zaev said after expressing his vote.
It said that a result in favour of changing the name would be "confirming our future".
According to a poll published last month by the Policy Research Institute, between 30% and 43% of citizens with the right to vote will participate in the referendum, under the number of participants required.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Among them, 70% said they would vote in favour of the change.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the vote must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first serious strike at the level of pro-vesc government policy since the government took over in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero de la Manchester City manages to pass through the entire Brighton team's defense and march a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to run the Brighton team's defense and win the Manchester City 2-0 team on Saturday at the Manchester Etihad stadium, England.
It seemed to Aguero that it was incredibly easy to march in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attack took a turn in the middle of the ground at the beginning of the sequence.
He moved very quickly among the three defensive players from Brighton before he got to the free part of the ground.
Then Aguero woke up surrounded by four opponents.
He managed to get past a defender, and then he overrun several adversarial players at the edge of Brighton's team.
After that, he gave a left hand, the balloon reaching Sterling.
The English attack sent the balloon back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, and managed to avoid the porter from Brighton, Matthew Ryan, with a shot at the right side of the gate.
"Aguero faces some problems on his feet," reported reporters Pep Guardiola, the Manchester City team manager.
“I talked to him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he wrote an empty one at the time."
But Sterling is the one who got them the initial advantage for Azura in the Premier League match.
The goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a deep passage on the Brighton team territory at that stage.
Then he gave Leroy Sane a hand on the left flank.
Sane blew the balloon a few times until she sent a passport to Sterling, who sent it to the gate.
The Azuri attack hit the balloon to the square just before it went out of the field.
Manchester City will meet at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday, with Hoffenheim in the group phase, at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to do the ravages in the fight against Rockies.
With the national team removed from the game-off competition, there were not too many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win Sunday's match against the Colorado Rockies team, but only if there are still implications in the play-off for Rockies, which has an advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies got at least an unforeseeable place, with a victory of 5-2 against the national team on Friday night, but still trying to keep its first title.
“Even if we don’t play for nothing, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here, from Denver, along with many, and the other team would probably play at the highest level of any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in these circumstances?"
The national team has not yet announced the player that will open the game on Sunday, but according to sources, it is intended to let Scherzer give the first shot in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be at the opening of the game number 34, had a heating session Thursday and would throw in normal conditions this Sunday.
The Washington average has a score of 18-7 and an ERA of 2.53 and 300 saves in 220 and 2/3 matches in this season.
Trump expresses his support in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation regarding a decision by the Supreme Court regarding Brett Kavanaugh as regards the importance of the Republic's presence in the interim elections.
“Our whole effort is at stake in November.
There are five more weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the great ones, not candidates, but actually candidates, which is why I'm trying out to support good candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “See this terrible, radical group of Democrats, see what happens right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using any means necessary, you can see their evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to scratch to get power and control, they want to have power and control, and we won't give it."
It has also said that democracies are in a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"And you can see this in the last four days," he said, describing the democrats as "serious and evil, foolish and lying."
He referred to Senator Diane Feinstein of the Democratic Party and is a member of the Senate Judicial Committee, which was severely persecuted by the public.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document?
Excuse me?
No. Hmm... I... sit down a little – that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labourist Party no longer tolerates people with a different view.
People who express their opinion are no longer tolerated
It didn't surprise me that Momentum activists in my local party supported the censorship movement with regard to me.
After all, I am just one of the members of the Labourist Party in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, has received a similar treatment because it has been fierce in anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, the censorship motion represented a criticism at my address that I did not agree with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
As for the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar problems, ironically, concerning which Jeremy did not share his views with previous leaders.
The communication to the Nottingham East Friday meeting of the Labour Party mentioned that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of the eight-year period as a member of Parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meetings of Friday night were so.
Unfortunately, today many meetings do not take place in this way, and the promise of a "better, lighter" political environment has been forgotten for a long time if it has ever been respected.
It has become increasingly evident that the different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of what is accepted by the party's leadership.
Things began to be so when Jeremy became the leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom I had a common vision about politics began to expect me to change my way of thinking and agree with some things that I had not previously agreed with, including counting national security or the single market in the EU.
Every time I talk to the public, no matter what I say, there is a wave of abuses on the de socialization networks that require my removal from the party, denouncing the policy of the centre, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person who faces this.
Actually, I know I'm happier than my colleagues, because the comments about my person tend to be political.
I am impressed by professionalism and the determination that my colleagues have proved to be facing sexual or racist abuse, but they maintain their level of involvement in this regard.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different views within the party, and with each motion of censorship or change of selection rules, the party becomes increasingly less flexible in this regard.
Many people have advised me in the last two years to put my head down, not to be so vocal, and everything "will be fine" like that.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labourist Party 32 years ago, when I was a student, motivated by the neglect shown by the Thatcher government has led to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who need them the most, as a local councillor or minister.
I've never hidden my political opinions, including the last elections.
No person in Nottingham East can say that my views on politics and the issues that I disagree with regarding current leadership are null and void.
People who have supported Friday's motion can only say that, in the context of the country's heading towards Brexit, which will affect our local households, businesses and services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to convey is not for the Momentum group in Nottingham, but for citizens, whether or not I am a member of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise you that no threat of removal from the party or political opportunism will stop me from making the decisions I consider to be in your best interest.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Air’s football team reaches the top of the classrooms
Despite the fact that two late trials have influenced in some way the final outcome, there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win the extremely interactive match of today's Tennent's Premiership.
It's now in the top of the class, being the only team without any defeat of the ten.
Finally, everything was summed up in their best defense, as well as in the fact that they took more of the chances, which helped the host team and thanked coach Peter Murchie.
"We have been subjected to several tests during our matches so far and we continue to be innocent, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "The medals are given to the Air team, they took more chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute trial, transformed by Frazier Climo, granted him an advantage to the Air team, but a yellow cartoon received by Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the team, playing at Warriors, allowed the Melrose team to change their score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an untransformed attempt.
Climo got a penalty for Ayr and, even in the middle of the game, managed to register, and then managed to transform an individual trial, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at break.
But Melrose started the second one very well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the tide to five points.
The game was suspended for a few minutes because of the serious injury of Ruarid Knott, who was pulled out of the field with the mark, and since the start of the game, Ayr has been disengaged by the trial of the player Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Captain Ayr, Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and again, the Melrose team made the reserve player pay with an unprocessed trial of Bruce Colvine at the end of a full pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow cardboard because he placed Climo without bullets, MacPherson managed to march, offering him the advantage of the Air team.
Climo transformed the experiment, as he did again almost from the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe performed a box kick movement and sent extreme Gregor Henry to the depth for the fifth attempt of the host team.
The "Still Game" site is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the star of the “Still Game” site, seems ready to move into the hospitality industry after he learned that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The man, 56 years old, plays Jack Jarvis's role in BBC-loving show, writing his script and playing with his partner for a long time, comedy actor Greg Hemphyll.
The two have announced that the next series, the new number, will be the last, and it seems that Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, this is the director of the company Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wants to be involved in the "industry in the development of restaurants".
"The sea is ours": the island of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol a shipyard full of macara in La Paz.
Public buildings are building the blue flag, like the ocean.
The ship bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is our right.
We have to get it back."
Along Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, the memory of a lost coast in front of Chile in a bloody conflict of the resources of the 19th century is still alive – just as the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are likely to be at the highest level in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the necessary maturity, a spirit of unity and senate and, of course, awaits the result with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow ICJ's decision on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will give a ruling in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of firm discussions, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign exit to the sea, Bolivia.
Here Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president – who faces a controversial battle for the coming year – also has a lot to win as a result of the month's decision .
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts think it's unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and that it would change too little things if it happened.
The United Nations agency in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant Chile's territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of the possible discussions.
The fact that the ICJ decision comes only six months after final pleas have been heard indicates that this case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And not only did Bolivia not succeed because, but it's possible for the last four years to have given it back.
"The problem of access to the sea was disturbed by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' s belligerent rhetoric weakened any Chilean remnant's goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at a given time, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not changed the ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually rapid.
On Monday, he will bring for Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of mutual advantage disputes," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – another of the most beloved presidents in Latin America – used the maritime problem as a political support.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we must pass through the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not take place if it cannot be trusted in the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea Foreign Minister, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons unless he could trust Washington.
He spoke again about this on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to respect the promises made during a summit in Singapore, with rival leaders.
His comments come in the context where the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to begin diplomatic action on nuclear threat after more than three months from Singapore's meeting with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
It stated that it is an "real visa" that the United States' continued sanctions and the United States' objection to the declaration concerning the end of the Korean war to ever cause the northern territory to surrender.
Washington is reluctant to agree with the statement without the Phenian taking significant steps first.
Both Kim and President of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there are many skeptics who don't think the Phenian has serious intentions to give up the arsenal the country considers the only way to ensure his safety.
Pompeo intends to visit the Phenian next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion presentation from Paris presents the latest trends with regard to the hats and will be available in stores soon
If you are looking for layers to extend your collection or to protect you completely from the sun, you no longer need to search.
Valentine's and Thom Browne's fashion designers shocked participants at the Paris Fashion Week, launching a series of oversized and extravagance decks for their spring-summer 2019 collection.
Practices have won the Instagram platform this summer, and fashion makers have sent the creations that steal eyes on the stage.
The creation resistance piece, made by Valentino, was an extravagant, bey-coloured hat with a large boob, similar to a penis, in which the heads of the models melted.
Other oversized accessories have included peppers decorated with carrots, a magic hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre fairs, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had ribs and brought more of Hannibal Lecter's chosen accessories, and did not have high-quality leather.
One of the creatures seemed to be a sinking equipment, having a tube of oxygen and glasses, while the other seemed to be a cold-cold cone.
And if you want to continue to adopt such a dress style, with oversized clothing items, you're lucky.
Stylists predict a return of huge dolls in luxury fashion stores.
The above-sized floors return after the appearance of the La Bomba hat, the straw hat with a large boor, seen all over the world, from Rihanna and to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the practical hat that appeared on all socialization networks caused the appearance of another oversized creature on the podium, that of the people of pay for the beach, with a size as large as the model in the bathroom that wears it.
The orange bag of rafie, with rafie brakes and a white leather handle, was the resistance piece of the spring-summer 2019 collection of Jacquemus's "La Riviera" at the Fashion Week of Paris
Vegetist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see the decks and beachmen oversized in the luxury shops next summer, because the fashion creator had such a strong impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Linguistic skills, essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results for examinations, which is supported by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to provide services at the highest level of their students and parents.
Independent schools propose to prepare their students for high school and higher education, their chosen career and place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will reach his mind.
If you speak his own language, words will reach his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's competition, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the classrooms, with the highest rates of promotion in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained a Higher Certificate A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72% of students received a Higher Grade A certificate in Mandarin; 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students received such a certificate.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will surely need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, as matter, are held as STEM subjects (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curriculums and in other areas.
A survey carried out by the British Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17% of employees had been assigned a lack of language skills for the fight against job vacancies.
Thus, more and more linguistic skills become imperative for preparing young people for their future career.
With more opportunities for jobs that require foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such a lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person before the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov on over 4,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to engage in a conversation, and the French language was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
Therefore, investment in foreign language learning is important for today’s children.
With more languages, especially in developing economies, children will have a greater chance of finding significant jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach other foreign languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be more languages of choice in independent schools, with the teaching framework that are specialized in this area.
Independent Scottish schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future may be.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital for the country's future, so that it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
It must be done well (It must be done).
John Edward is director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron will begin at Lakers Sunday, in San Diego
Expectation is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James as he debuts for Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James would play in the opening of Sunday's pressure against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
But how many minutes will the game remain to be established.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, wrote on Twitter that James would probably play limited minutes.
Following the training from the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the Six Pressure Lakers program.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need games in the press to prepare," he said.
Trump's West Virginia election time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five Trump meetings scheduled next week, which includes stops in places where the electorate is favorable, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the confirmation vote for his elected candidate for the seat of the Supreme Court is suspended temporarily, Trump wants to strengthen support for future elections by mid-term term, as the Republicans risk losing control of the Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump's election meeting take place in West Virginia tonight and where can I track him online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00, East Coast time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can track Trump's West Virginia election rally online through live video stream below on YouTube.
Trump will probably discuss Brett Kavanaugh's hearing this week, a candidate for the Supreme Court, a hearing that has become tense due to allegations of improper sexual behaviour, while the Senate's expected confirmation vote is suspended for a week so that the FBI will investigate the allegations.
But the main objective of this series of meetings is to help Republicans, who face tough elections in November, to win a little field.
Thus, President Trump's campaign stated that the role of these five meetings next week is "to energize volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority held in the Senate and in the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control over Congress is so important for its programme that the president will travel as many states as possible before entering the very crowded campaign season," a spokesman for Trump's campaign said to Reuters, who did not want to be named.
Programmable to take place in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this evening's meeting could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be presented in the Pittsburgh mass media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won the elections at a difference of more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is being conducted in the polls.
"The fact that the president came to try to drive him into the polls is not a good sign for Morrisey," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team gives evidence of determination and continues to fight to maintain the chance for simple trials that start Sunday
After three clearly dominated sessions, it is possible that the Saturday afternoon forum was the exact thing Cupa Ryder needed.
The always oscillating pendulum of motivation is a concept invented for the sport world, but players really believe in it, so much more in the case of competitions like this.
So where's their motivation now?
"They led us with six points, now the difference is just four points, so we're based on this drop for a little motivation," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with an advance of four points, when there are still twelve points in play.
Americans, says Spielth, feel that the game begins to change in favor of them and that there are plenty of reasons for encouragement, of which the most important is the form of Spielth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and have won every three out of four points.
Spielth sent the mines to the green zone with a lethal precision, being an example for his colleagues.
Those juicy walnuts of the holiday have become more and more noisy as the advance runs, especially when he wrote down a crucial point by which he evened the score in the fourth match, after he and Thomas had been driven two points after the first two holes.
The hit that won the game at 15 was celebrated with a similar urlet, a urlet that makes you think the American team still has a chance.
"You just have to concentrate and worry only about your own game," says Spieth.
So much for these players.
18 holes to leave a good impression.
The single players with more points than Spielth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange, but adorable couple of Europe won four out of four matches and it seems I can't fail.
Moliwood was the only pair that did not need any additional hit on Saturday afternoon, but this statement is valid both for Saturday mornings, and for Friday afternoons, even for the new points of Friday mornings.
This performance and how their energy seems to flow towards and among the enthusiastic audience reinforces the view that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they would finally lead a potential victory of the Europeans when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time, at different doors.
Discussions on the glory of Europeans remain premature for a while.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson passed quickly by Sergio Garcia, the hero in the morning at the fourballs test, when she made a pair with Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two doubles at the first nine holes drowned Spanish and Swedish in a pit so deep that they were not even close to getting out of it.
Sunday, however, no one will be safe.
The tests of fourballs and foursomes are fascinating and are worth almost follow-up due to the interactions between pairs, data and missing tips and the way a strategy can be modified on the spot.
Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the final day, but this forum session has shown and that the US team has the motivation to continue fighting, which some, especially those in the United States, doubt.
Europe runs 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe begins the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after closing the fourball matches and Saturday forums with an advantage of 10-6 in front of the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led offensively with two victories in front of an exciting Tiger Woods, which has so far increased their score at Le Golf National at four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to regain the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated American players who made a lot of mistakes in the morning's fourballs trial and won the 3-1 series.
The US opposed a more serious resistance to the foursome test, where it won two matches, but could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from the 12 simple Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European news that wins four points in turn, and along with Molinari, a pair named "Mollwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair that wins four of the four opening matches in the entire history of the Cupe Ryder.
After they smashed Woods and Patrick Reed into a fourballs test, they superlatively supported themselves to defeat the downfall of Woods and the American newsmen Bryson Dechambe with an even clearer score, 5-4.
Woods, who had problems in the two matches on Saturday, had occasional genius sculptures, but so far lost 19 of the 29 matches at fourballs and foursomes, seven of which were successive clashes.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's fourballs session, returned with partner Henrik Stenson to the foursome test and confronted Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, one and three positions in the world.
Europe did not, however, have a course without obstacles on this pleasant and refreshing day in south-west Paris.
Jordan Spieth, triple winner of major tournaments, and Justin Thomas became the benchmark for Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They managed to win with 2-1 a match against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a fourball test, then returned later and confronted Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 to 3 in a foursome test, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Cup Ryder has managed a team to recover a deficit of four points in simple trials, although, because they are the current owners of the trophy, Furyk players only need an equal result.
However, after they were in place for the second two days in a row, a Sunday contraction seems unlikely.
North Korea declares that there is no "no chance" of unilateral disarming as long as there is no confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister said on Saturday to the United Nations that the extension of sanctions will deepen confidence in the United States and that it is impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the Global Council that in North Korea "significant measures have been implemented to prove their faith" last year, such as the stopping of nuclear tests and the testing of rockets, the dismantling of the nuclear testing site and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any appropriate response from the US," he said.
"If we cannot trust the US, we will not trust our national security capabilities and, in such circumstances, we cannot disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's family's objections to Washington's opposition to a "sampled" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps, his statement seemed significant because it did not directly reject unilateral denuclearization, as the Phenian did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump in a summit between a US president and North Korea leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim undertook to make progress towards a "declaration of the Korean peninsula", while Trump provided security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea has been looking for an official end to the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has stated that the Phenian must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington has not made requests for the release of the hard international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists on the option "first denuclearisation" and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose in a coercive way, even objecting to the "war final declaration"," Ri said.
"The impression that the sanctions can be passed on to us is an illusion that only people who do not know us.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our lack of confidence."
He did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader referred to in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the President of South Korea, for the past five months, adding: "If the problem of denuclearisation had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse."
Even under these conditions, Ri's tone of speech was very different from that of last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the US territory with rockets from North Korea after "Mr. Malefic" Trump called Kim a "ho-rocket" in a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which threatened North Korea last year with "total destruction", praised Kim for his courage to launch the disarmament process, but stated that work was only beginning and that sanctions would remain valid until North Korea is denuclearized.
Wednesday, Trump said there is no time planned for this and added: "It does not matter whether it takes two or three months or five months."
China and Russia say the Phenian should be compensated by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council: "The application of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue in force and without interruption until we obtain complete, final and confirmed denuclearisation."
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to block the funds for nuclear programmes and the ballistic missiles of the Phenian.
Pompeo met with Ri on the colours of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit the Phenian again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not have too good results.
When he left Phenian in July, he said that progress had been made, but only a few hours later, North Korea denounced the fact that it had made " gangsterous threats".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has undertaken to demonstrate a missile launch ramp and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "relevant measures".
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump promised to Singapore and that he wanted to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses on how to rest enough
A new course from Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the growing culture of Macho that makes these people subject to learning sessions "all night", energized with a lot of caffeine.
A scientist has discovered that, often, students of the most prestigious universities in the world do not even master the basic concepts of how they should care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of this type in the US.
It was inspired to create the course after holding a conference on the impact of sleeplessness on the ability to learn.
"At last, a girl came and said to me, "Why is this just said to me now, in the last year?"
She told me she was never talking to her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, introduced in the premiere this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance, as well as general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The course that takes an hour may involve a series of interactive tasks.
A section presents a picture of a home room, and students can click on coffee houses, losses, sports pants and books to tell them what are the effects of coffee and light and how athletic performance is affected by the lack of sleep, but also about the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily program.
“We know we can’t change the student behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know what the effects of smoking on health are," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that makes students proud that they have learned all night still exists, says it, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure imposed on students have turned sleep deprivation into a growing problem.
Sleep enough, of a good quality, should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain think that the body is hungry, which makes the students feel hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the course, after participating in one of his first courses at Harvard.
She said the course opened her eyes and inspired her to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all post-university students to complete a similar study programme before joining this institution where the competition is at stake.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students schedule an alarm to know when it is time to sleep, as well as for waking hours, and to know what the harmful effects of the "blue light" are from electronic screens and LEDs, which may disturb the circadian rhythm and cause difficulties when they try to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to capture Gerrard's team
Rangers suffer from another case of displacement depression because Dolly Menga's beating condemned Steven Gerrard's inconvenient team to a 1-0 assault on Livingstone.
Ibrox's team wanted to win the first victory in the 4-1 win from the winner in February against St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team managed to run Gerrard's second round of 18 games as coach, which puts Rangers with eight points behind Hearts, the authorial leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga wrote seven minutes before the break and uninspired players from Rangers didn't seem at any point able to equalize.
Rangers fell so in the sixth position in the ranking, while Livingston went up the third, behind Hibernate, to a difference of one goal.
And Rangers could also face other problems, because the Calum Spence cough arbitrator had to be treated for a head injury after an object was, it seems, thrown over the bench of the visiting team fans.
Gerrard changed eight players from the lottery that won easily against Air in the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players from Livingstone who managed to get an equal to Hearts last week and has all the reasons to be proud of the way his well-trained lot has suffocated his opponents during the game.
Even if Rangers had a superior possession, Livingston used the mines they had more efficiently.
It should have been only two minutes after the start of the game, when Menga's first step moved Scott Pittman to the protective gate of Allan McGregor, but the middle house missed a very good opportunity.
A deep-seated hit by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, sent it to the bar.
Rangers took control, but left the impression that more hope than trust in their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos thought that he should have received a penalty when he was playing with Steven Lawless in the 15th minute of the game, but Arbitrary Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian request.
Rangers managed only two hits on the front door in the first round, but the former porter on Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was not at all disturbed by Lassana Coulibally's head or Ovie Ejaria's weak blow.
Although the 34 minute gap of the Livingstones did not respect the trend of the game, no one can deny that it was worth it, even for the effort put forward.
Again, Rangers failed to prevent Jacobs' deep center.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent Scott Robinson's ball, which kept calm and passed on to Menga, who ended up with a simple blow.
Gerrard acted on the break when he changed Ryan Kent with Coulibally; this move almost gave way immediately when the extreme focused Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of the shoes to block him.
However, Livingstone continued to attract visitors to exactly the same type of match she prefers, with Lithgov and Halkett who intercepted the center after the center.
Holt's team could have extended the advantage in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs' strike, then Lithgow sent a head on the side of the corner.
Glenn Middleton, reserve at Rangers, asked for a penalty at the end of the game, when he was hit by Jacobs, but again Thomson did not agree.
Almanah: inventor of Geiger's office
And now, a page from our Sunday Sunday Sunday: September 30, 1882, with 136 years ago (and CONTINUE count...), is the day that was born in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as Geiger counter.
An essential device for science since then, the Geiger County has become essential for pop culture, as was the case in the film "Clopotes of San Coronado" (1950), in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played the role of a cowboy with unlikely scientific inclination:
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear these boxes, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted from radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Yes, I hear a lot of applause!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before he was 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells and destroy them
As part of treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, their alteration in a laboratory
They can "detect" a common protein of many cancers and then are re-injected
A test vaccine offers promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
Ovarian cancer of a woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise harmful cells has been missing for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can "detect" a common protein of many cancers, called HER2, then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Oncology Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "determins the increase in several types of cancer", including breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, to take immune cells from patients and to "learn them" to target cancer cells, also worked for the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held a Trump's support diaries, while wearing a MAGA hat, after the appearance of SNL.
It didn't come out too well.
Kanye West was shot in the studio during Saturday Night Live's show after a show in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he intended to run for the 2020 elections.
After playing the third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat Make America Great, the artist resigned in a speech against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
"Many times when I'm talking to a white person, I'm asked, "How can you like Trump? He's racist"
Well, if I had been worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a scene where Matt Damon played, in which Hollywood star took over Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee on the charges of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the movie with West's Diabetes was loaded on social media by Comandian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock is trying to get over West with this post.
In addition, the West complained to the public that he had problems in the hives because of his bosses.
"They tried to scare me into the clumsies.
They told me, "Don't go out wearing this hat."
I was attacked!
They've told me I've come down a lot," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how low I am?" then he said "I'm going to take over Superman because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to evolve?
Try with love."
His comments attracted audiences at least twice, and SNL team members seemed to be standing, Variety reported; a member of this team said to the publication: "A full silence has been reached in the studio."
West was invited as a last-hour replacement for the soloist Ariana Grande, whose beloved rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West raised many cracks when he played song I Love it dressed as a glass of Perrier.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "For one of the bravest spirits of us: I'M GLOATED."
Karen Hunter, the owner of a talk show, wrote on Twitter that West simply "was himself and that is wonderful".
"While I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "art") about whom I think he embraces and expresses a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, announcing that from now on he is "the person officially known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name; the West treads on Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former legend of music, Prince, changed his name into a symbol and then into "the earlier known artist as Prince".
A charge of attempted murder for an injection into a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant on the east side of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defence lawyer was expected to stand before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The allegations will be examined by the Public Prosecutor.
Kit Harington, the star of the thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for the role of Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series The Thrones Urzeala, produced by HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of macho hero, saying that presenting these roles on the screen makes the boys think they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something wrong has happened" and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity can be managed in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his colleague in the Thrones Bridge, Rose Leslie, who is 31 years old, admitted that it is "very determined" to talk about this problem.
"Personally, I am very determined to talk about it now: where did I fail with masculinity?" he asked.
"What have we taught men about how to be adults, given the problem we are facing now?"
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through very male characters.
He continued: “What is born again, and what is taught?
What do young boys learn from TV and from the street, what makes them think they have to be a certain type of man?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time: how can we change this?
Because it's clear that something wrong with the young has happened."
In an interview, he admitted that he would not play in any series based on the Throne Urzela after the series ends in the summer of next year, saying that he "ended with the battlefields and horses".
In November, Kit will play in a new production of the True West play by Sam Shepard, who presents the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a star.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened to him because of the series of the Thrones is that he met his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife when I did this show, so she assured me the future of my family and my life from now on," Kit said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, Jon Snow's girlfriend, the character played by Kit in the winning fantasy series of several Emmy awards.
The couple got married in June 2018, on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this disease in China, officials say.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, unlike those of the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced close to zero, Chinese health officials say at a conference in Yunnan province.
From one year to the next, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually get married to a woman.
Many of the cases of transmission of diseases stem from inadequate measures of sexual protection in such relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to medicines against HIV as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has disclosed the data of senators of the Republican Party, talks about "dangerous minions" and "conspiracy theories"
Representative Maxine Waters filed a statement on Saturday that a member of his team provided personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the accusations were made by analysts and websites of "extreme right".
"Minions, lies and other miserable lies," Waters said in a Twitter post.
The information disclosed included the personal address and phone numbers of the senators. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information appeared online Tuesday, posted by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a hearing in the Senate on allegations of improper sexual behaviour against Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as a judge at the Supreme Court.
The leak of information took place shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservation sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and presented the information of a member of the Waters team, reported Hill.
"These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of the team, whose identity, personal and security information was compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie."
Waters' statements were criticised online shortly after they were made, including the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that he does not have the temperature needed to be a member of the Congress.
When someone's accused of something they didn't do, he doesn't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be challenging.
The defendant's motive must not be undermined.
It must be calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to that of Judge Kavanaugh, criticised by Democrats, who said he seemed a little too angry during the Tuesday hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican who is running against Waters in the mid-term elections, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
"I don't care if it's true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said her office warned “the appropriate legal authorities and entities regarding these false accusations.
"We will ensure that the artists will be discovered," she continued, "and that they will be responsible in front of the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of my team members."
Review Johnny English hits again: the flagless parody of spy movies, with Rowan Atkinson in the main role
It has become a tradition to search for Brexit's associated meanings in any new British film, but this also does not apply to the new film series of action films that has it as the main character of Johnny English, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English.
Will this ephemeral satire of how strange we are to become the new export opportunity of the nation?
Anyway, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with blind eyes and rubber face, was renewed to the second time the license to destroy everything. The name of the character means, firstly, that it is a general comical creation for the cinematographic audience in English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, a sloppy secret agent who, despite his claims at luxury and extravagance, has a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr. Bean and a knife tip from that guy who contributed with a single note to the chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
The character is based on the explorer and the mysterious man without the country that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's TV ads, which left a mess behind.
This last adventure of the JE has one or two nice moments.
I liked it when Johnny English got close to an helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the wheels of the rotor hit his carpet easily.
The gift Atkinson has for physical comedy is highlighted, but humor is quite weak and strangely superfluous, especially because the "serious" movies, such as those in the 007 series or impossible Mission, offer comic moments as an ingredient with confidence.
Death seems to address more children than adults and, for me, Johnny English's adventures are not as inventive and intelligent as Atkinson's dumb film gangs when playing in Bean's role.
As usual, the assumption is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber hacker infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies and revealed the identities of British agents undercover, towards the disbanding of the service agent, a pitiful role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister who is already suffering a serious crisis because of a decline in political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything he can with his like Theresei May character, but the scenario does not give him a chance to shine.
Its secret information advisors inform her that all active spies have been compromised, so that an agent in reserve must be activated.
This is Johnny English's uncle himself, now working as a teacher in a high school, but giving lessons about how to be an undercover agent. Here are some nice cages, because English conducts a school-style spy academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall, for an emergency meeting, then met with his time partner, Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a bit annoying.
So these Batman and Robin of the creation of interferences in the Secret Service of His Majesty return to action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletin, interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the spell of a charismatic billionaire of the technology industry that claims he can solve the UK's IT problems: the Jason Volta puzzle, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start in an odise of storm adventures: worn out in waiters, giving fire to a French-style restaurant, creates chaos when it slams on the board of Volta's luxury boat, then English launches anarchy in pure form when trying to use a set of glasses for virtual reality to familiarize itself with the inside of Volta's house.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but, as much as the movie is nice and colorful, it looks like a television production for children.
A pretty mediocre movie.
Like the other movies with Johnny English, I can't stop asking myself: can't the British cinema industry even give Rowan Atkinson a role as his talent?
The labs deny that they have plans for British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would have a radical plan, according to which the British would only work four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
It seems that the party wants the company's bosses to benefit from the potential savings due to the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) giving the employees another day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the salary would not be changed.
The sources say that the idea would be "consistent" with the party's economic programme, which wants to promote balance in favour of workers.
The shift to work week of four days is supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way that workers can benefit from changing the economy.
A source of leadership from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: “The announcement of a policy review is expected before the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight, but a work week of four days is a proper aspiration to approach the economic recovery party in favour of the worker, as well as the general strategy of the industrial party."
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day working week was one of the Green Party's 2017 campaign promises for general elections.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A spokesperson of the Labour Party said: "The week of work for four days is not a party policy and is not included in the party calculation."
The shadow cabinet's Chancellor, John McDonnell, took advantage of the Labourers' conference last week to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said it is determined to take back the power of "no-faced directors" and "professors" from utility companies.
The plans of the Chancellor of the shadow cabinet also refer to the fact that the current action of the water-supply regions could not recover its entire action, because the Labour Government could experience "deductions" due to established offences.
It also confirmed plans to appoint employees in company management councils and to create property funds by giving up 10% of the equity of private sector firms to employees, who will receive such annual dividends of up to about 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal in the "60 Minutes" show if Kavanaugh's investigation by the FBI would make him reconsider.
The FBI's investigation of the charges brought by Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed his final vote on his candidacy as a judge in the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised the question whether the Republican senators could be convinced that he would no longer support him because of the FBI's findings.
In a broadcast Sunday interview, the correspondent "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make him reconsider.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do this than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said this from the beginning of the hearings; I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when that happened, when the charges came up, and I asked him, "Are you guilty?"
The answer was decided, quickly, without mistake."
Graham's vote, however, seems to be buried in a rock.
"I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so some explosive charges would be needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that: Brett strongly rejects the accusations," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the persons named by her have confirmed the report.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt something's going to change."
What is the Festival of Global Citizens and has it managed to do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Global Citizens, an annual musical event that will be attended by an impressive group of stars, with an equally impressive mission: eradicating world poverty.
Until the seventh edition, the Festival of Global Citizens will attract tens of thousands of people on the Central Park Square, not only to track artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Festival of Global Citizens, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of lawyers who hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (except where they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers had to buy a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to world leaders, making phone calls or other significant things that help raise awareness of the goal of eliminating global poverty.
But what was the success of the Global Citizens' Festival when I'm only 12 years old to reach the goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act or is it just another case so-called "clickivism", a concept that refers to people who feel they have done something by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizens, since 2011 more than 19 million "actions" have been recorded by its supporters, who have promoted different objectives.
The organisation says that these actions have prompted world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group spoke of 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, in which at least 10 billion dollars were already spent or strained.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership with the UK headquarters of investors and intermediaries who have committed to "help children grow up to their full potential", which promised to offer Rwanda 35 million dollars to contribute to the eradication of malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4700 Twitter messages from global citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens as well as you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition to become just a footnote in the history book," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador The Power of Nutrition, in front of the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions have been taken in Britain to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it will finance the The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most frequent questions on their website: "What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult path, sometimes we will fall and make mistakes.
But like the great movements for civil rights or anti-apartheid that took place before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists who will sing at the event this year in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the naval forces for a "block" to exacerbate Russia's energy exports, says the Internal Secretary
Washington may, "if necessary", appeal to the naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including in the Middle East, has revealed the US Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's commitment to Syria, in particular, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why I am in the Middle East is that I want to mediate energy sales, as I do in Eastern Europe and southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and methods to manage the situation.
"The United States has the capacity, through our naval forces, to ensure that the sea routes are open and, if necessary, to create a barrier, so that energy does not come into the market," he said.
Zinke is addressed to participants at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that declares "the voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
It continued by comparing the way Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is practically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of fuels," he said, saying about Russia that "knows one thing" because of the fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The declarations come at a time when Trump administration is trying to increase natural gas exports to Europe, to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, Trump's administration representatives, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would turn Berlin into a Moscow "prisoner".
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion project of Nord Stream 2, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin said the US's fierce opposition to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we look at things the same way: energy cannot be an instrument by which to put pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Aleksandr Novak, the minister of energy in Russia, after a meeting with Rick Perry, U.S. Secretary of Energy in Moscow, in September.
The US position attracted criticism from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main industrial organisation in Germany, the Federation of Industries in Germany (BDI), asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with the fact that a third state is involved in our energy issues," said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is "serious" to run for the 2020 presidential elections, says Senator of Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, said on Saturday that he must "think seriously" if he is to run for presidential elections after the mid-term elections.
During the meeting at the primacy of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidacy.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and repair our strict government, and that's why a strong woman is needed," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will think seriously if I run for presidential elections."
Warren also had something to say about President Donald Trump during the first meeting, saying that he "directed the country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was a very vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a message posted on Friday, Warren said "normally we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll published Thursday showed that no majority of Warren's electors do believe it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" vote in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such an application.
The poll showed more support for a former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy: 38% of respondents support a potential candidate and 48% oppose it.
Other names of well-known democracies that could run in 2020 are those of Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
Biden said he'd decide officially by January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the posttraumatic stress syndrome that Track Palin suffers at a Donald Trump meeting
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after falling into September.
Monday night, he was arrested and accused in a case of domestic violence
"The ills through which my own son passed, through which he came back... can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of the posttraumatic stress syndrome and the consequences of the injuries that our soldiers are returning with," said the assembled audience at a meeting to support Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant of the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "will return a little different, harder, wondering whether there is more respect for what they and their soldiers in the army and the air forces, as well as all the other members of the Army, have done for the country".
It was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of a domestic violence and holding a firearm in a state of drunkenness, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Colombia contest a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support a legal challenge to the new US policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims who are trying to escape from the violence caused by the host or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and District have completed a friendly request for care Friday, in Washington, to support a policy challenge on asylum seekers, NBC News reports.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions process, which the American Civil Liberties Union organisation initiated in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent sons, members of a guest", abused her, but US officials refused her asylum on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
The state attorney who represents Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produced a large number of asylum seekers in the US, as nations facing a generalized problem with domestic violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy annulled a 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Council which allowed immigrants without acts trying to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Colombia, Karl Racine, said Friday that the new policy "is ignoring the decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"The federal law says that all asylum applications must be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a restriction violates this principle," writes friend curiae.
In addition, lawyers argue that the policy that refuses the entry of immigrants affects the US economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "furnish the necessary labour force".
Jeff Sessions, U.S. Attorney General, ordered judges in June for immigration cases to no longer grant asylum to victims who were trying to escape the abuse and violence of the guests.
"The asylum is granted to those who leave their country driven by persecution or fear because of discrimination based on race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or because of a political opinion," Sessions said on June 11, when politics announced.
The role of asylum was never to solve all the problems people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Rescue operations desperate in Palu, where the number of deaths doubled, in a chronometer race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become more and more serious.
"The situation seems very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who relieves her baby suffering from fever at an evacuation centre in the destroyed town of Palu.
"The ambulatory brings troops all the time.
Drinking water is not enough."
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their flood-free goods, trying to save everything that could be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale, were overstated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures at the spine and shoulder, rest outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients are treated freely due to strong and continuous replicas.
She has eyes full of tears when she remembers how she felt the violent earthquake shaking the hotel room from the 5th floor that she shared with her wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was caught in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, then just shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope I'm safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of "absorbing" of "propaganda claims"
A week after an official newspaper from China published a four-page advertisement in a daily U.S. of praise for the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using American press to distribute propaganda materials.
US President Donald Trump referred Wednesday to the supplement paid by China in Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of mixing in the November 6 elections for Congress, an accusation that China rejects.
The charge that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections marked what US officials said to Reuters is a new phase in a escalating campaign in Washington to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are now blocked in a growing trade war, which entails price increases for imports.
Prices imposed by China as a revenge, at the beginning of the trade war, were created to affect exporters from countries like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, experts from China and the US said.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former governor in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijingul injured American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In a Sunday editorial published in Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China "continues to abuse this by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press".
"When propaganda spreads through the publication of a advertisement in Des Moines Register, the Chinese government does not respect the tradition of freedom of expression and free press in America," Branstad writes.
"In return, you will find a few voices of dissidents on the street from Beijing and you will not see any real reflection of the divergent opinions that Chinese citizens have about China's worrying economic journey, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say what newspaper it is about.
Republicans draw women's votes before the mid-term elections because of the Kavanaugh scandal, analysts warn
As many of the top republics support and protect Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, several charges of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a counter-reaction, especially on the part of women, during future elections from the mid-term.
The emotions created by this scandal have been extremely strong, and the majority of the Republicans who have discussed it publicly intend to continue the vote.
"Such reactions will not be forgotten," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, for The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he has doubts that the recent initiative of Senator Jeff Flake (the representative of Arizona) on an FBI investigation will calm the angry electorate.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow, and they will not forget in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and spokesperson of the National Progressive Group, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors called for "Come November!" while demonstrating on the Senate halls when the Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee chose to continue the Kavanaugh nomination process despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be very great," said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst for the news site.
"People say they were already very big and that's true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among female indecisive voters from the suburbs and the young electorate, between 18 and 29 years of age, who, although they do not attack the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he detailed charges of sexual abuse brought to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that it could be a counter-reaction if the Republicans continued the confirmation process.
"This has turned into an obstacle for Republicans," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Republican Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote or the possibility that Kavanaugh would be confirmed, but also how the Republicans treated this situation and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities, an electoral support group for the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be relatively divided with regard to the party that they should believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh: a little more seems to believe it afterwards.
A new survey carried out by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents believe in bullies or believe that Ford's testimony is likely to be true, while 35% said it believed in bullies or that Kavanaugh's testimony is likely to be true.
In addition, 38% said that Kavanaugh probably lied or certainly, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least another person, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford swore under oath before the Senate Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh abused her, in a state of drunkenness, at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nomination to the Supreme Court exposed the genital organs to her when she attended a party while they were students at Yale in 1980.
The World Wide Web inventor plans to set up a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend in the field of technology, Inrupt, is a solid-based company, Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt is "global domination".
"Now we have to do it," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data archives" or PODs.
It may contain contact lists, programs, calendars, music libraries or other personal and professional instruments.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would be all available in one browser, all of them from time to time.
What is unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has full control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this "personal consolidation through data".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea is that Inrupt contributes with adequate resources, processes and skills, so as to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of developers working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely over-done from time to time.
"We do not ask permission for them."
In a post published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even after the Inrupt launch, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the clergyman who won the Crucea Victoria in World War I is celebrated
The only cleric of the Anglican Church who won a medal Crucea Victoria as a fighter in the First World War was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918 at Bellengliese and Lehaucourt.
It was killed by a lunetist four days later and never knew that the highest military honor of the Great Britain had been given.
A memorial stone was set up on Saturday by his two nephews during the Rushden parade, Northamptonshire.
One of the nephews, Michael Vann, said it was "beautiful of symbolic" that the stone would be developed exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal of Saint-Quentin "by a very beautiful glass and under the intense fire of artillery and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the front line and, with "a fantastic bravure", opened the way for the soldiers, then attacked alone a artillery cube and managed to eliminate three of the weapons of detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German lunetist on October 4, 1918, just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said his grandfather's actions were "a thing I know I will never be equal to him, but it makes me feel bad".
This, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also filed a crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said that "it is very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people give it".
The MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but received animated drawings with Peppa Pig, in exchange
Imagine that you stayed up all night following Bellator 206, an event with many stars, just so you can't follow the main event.
The San Jose event programme contained 13 fights, including six on the main panel, and had to be broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock, exactly when Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, British viewers were amazed when the transmission was replaced with a Peppa Pig episode.
Some were not thankful at all because they stayed three nights to see the struggle.
A fan described on Twitter the transition to animated drawing for children as "a kind of bad joke".
"Governmental regulations say that this content is not suitable for 6 o'clock in the morning, so they had to change to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Senior President of Bellator for marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa pig, yes."
Scott Coker, president of the Bellator company, said that in the future, they will program their events in such a way that they can be tracked by viewers from the UK.
"When I'm thinking about rewinding, I think we could probably solve it," Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday here and we won't be able to do that until Sunday, our time, or months, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, I thought it was a technical disturbance.
But it wasn't about that, it was about a government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We're going to sum up five fights instead of six, as we usually do.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low" because of sexuality
Olympic sculptor Tom Daley says he's grown up feeling that he's inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this has motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he only realized when he got to school that "not everyone is like me".
Invited to the first Desert Island Discs show presented by Lauren Laverne, on Radio 4, he said he talks about the rights of gay people to give them another "hope".
The athlete also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the usual presentation of the traditional show, will miss a few months due to a disease.
Invited to the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that when he was a child, he felt "downside" others because "I didn't think it was socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "So far, these feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt different, were the real things that gave me the strength and resistance to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that it was "someone," he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympic Games became a renowned supporter of the LGBT campaigns and took advantage of the appearance at the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to ask several countries to decriminate homosexuality.
She said she decided to speak because she felt fortunate that she could live free, without a trace, and because she wanted to give the other "hope".
The triple world champion said "was taken by surprise" because he fell in love with a man, American cinematist Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married Oscar's winning filmmaker last year, who is 20 years older than he, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a fraggot age" - he participated in the first Olympics when he was only 14 years old, and his father died of cancer after three years - he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who's been through the same good and bad times.
In June, both became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, says Daley, changed his "whole perspective".
"If I were asked last year, I wouldn't be interested in anything but winning a gold medal," she said.
“You know what? There are more important things than gold medals at the Olympic Games.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears his father's name, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted to find out if he got tickets for the 2012 London Olympic Games, because he wanted to be first.
"I couldn't tell him "you couldn't be first, Dad," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and barely after he stopped breathing and died I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that I had dreamed of a whole life, going out in front of the spectators of my country at the Olympic Games, there is no more beautiful feeling," he said.
This also inspired him in selected music, Proud of Heather Small, a song that encouraged him before the Olympic Games and still excited him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15.
Mickelson, out of shape, went to the reserve bank on Saturday, in Cupa Ryder.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday, when he plays in the forty-seven games of Cupa Ryder, but he will have to go back to a good form so that this is not an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, who plays in the binary event for the twelfth time, another record, has been on Captain Jim Furyk's reserve bank for fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as it has been many times for the United States team, the winner of major tournaments divided the day between being major for the teamers and practicing the beats, hoping that he will correct what was wrong.
The 48-year-old player has never had the right drives, not even in the best period of his career, so it's not the best choice for the narrow terrain at Le Golf National, where long rough areas often punish the wrong hits.
And if the ground isn't a big enough challenge, in Sunday's 9th match, Mikkelson will face Francesco Molinari, the British Open's mythical champion, who joined with the newsmen Tommy Fleetwood and won all four matches of the week.
Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial to Americans, led by four points into the 12 simple matches, which must begin in force at this stage.
Furyk has expressed confidence in his player's ability, but he couldn't have said anything else anyway.
"He fully understood the role he had today, beat me on his shoulder, hugged me and told me he would be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams last week and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play in two matches.
I imagined more, but this happened and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to play, like everyone else."
Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's memory for the most games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which was no longer raised at the level of his personal memory.
Mickelson has 18 matches won, 20 lost and seven half, although Furyk said his presence has brought untold advantages to the team.
"It's funny, it's sarcastic, smart, it likes to joke with players, it's a great guy in the team's wardrobe," he explained.
"I think young players are having fun with him, it was fun to see him doing this during the week.
His role is more important, it's not just about the game."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that considerable progress could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of the simple trials in Cupa Ryder can easily be turned into an uncomfortable journey.
Denmark started in the 1997 Valderram game, when the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros led the Americans with five points, but only if he managed to overcome them with a minimum difference of 141⁄2 to 1311⁄2.
"I remember having a considerable advance in Valderrama; I had a big advance in Brooklyn, where I lost, and in Valderrama, where I could barely win," said Bjorn (in picture) after following as the 2018 team, who won with 5-3, both Friday and yesterday, and now runs with 10-6 on Le Golf National.
"So history shows me, me and my team, that it's not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play for the best.
Let's get out of the field and do everything perfect.
The game is not ready until the points have passed on the table.
We have a goal and this is to win this trophy, it must remain objective.
I always said, we have to focus on the 12 players in our team, but we know and what awaits us on the other side: the best players in the world."
Glad to see how his players handled a difficult field, Bjorn added: “I am not quick to reach conclusions.
Tomorrow's with everything else.
Individual performances are important tomorrow, and this is different.
It's great to be on the ground with a partner when things go well, but when you're on your own, then you're tested to the maximum, as a golfer.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, that it must be in the best form tomorrow.
Now leave their partner behind and have to play as well as I can."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opposing team, hopes that his players will play better at the simple test than they did with their partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such a return the last day: he was in the winning Brooklyn team, then in the losing when Europe succeeded the "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every word," he answered when asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, managed to encourage players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow and we would like to start with some quick victories, like at Brooklyn, like at Medina.
When the inertia develops in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle-aged matches.
We created the right lot and ordered the players as we wanted, you know, we're trying to create a little magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of leading the fight: he will face Rory McIlroy in the main match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the program.
"I have chosen this group of players, in this order, because I think it covers all subjects," Bjorn said about the lot for a simple test.
The new German warship, again delayed
Germany's newest naval forces should have been operational in 2014 in order to replace the warships of the Cold War, but this will only happen year after year, due to defective systems and rising costs, local press reported.
The entry into service of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ ship, the standard ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg fleet, was now delayed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, which quotes a military speaker.
The vessel should have been introduced into the maritime forces in 2014, but problems arising after delivery have affected this ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the Military Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
They are supposed to be provided with a strong tone, with a range of anti-aircraft and anti-vas rockets, as well as with stealth technologies, which provide a radar, infrared and low-acoustic print.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; new frieds should be possible to go to missions for two years without returning to the original port.
However, the ongoing delays mean that these last-generation warships, which are said to increase Germany's maritime strength, will already be old-fashioned before entering service, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 Fried Ghinionist was discussed in the press last year, when Germany's Military Navy officially refused to take the vessel and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
There is not much information available about the reasons for the refusal, but the German media quoted a number of critical "software and hardware defects" that would have made the warship useless in a battle mission.
The software defects were especially important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the teams of the older crew of the Bremen class.
In addition, it was proved that the vessel had a very large weight, which reduced its performance and limited the ability of the Military Navy to add future equipment.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton vessel "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as the German vessels used in World War II.
Alongside the faulty mechanisms, and the cost of the whole project, including the training of the team, has become a cause for concern.
It is said to have reached a floating figure of €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from the initial price of €2.2 billion.
The problems of the newest frigates are of particular importance in view of the latest warnings that say the maritime power of Germany is falling.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Military Navy "started to remain without vessels that could be sent to missions".
The officer said that the problem has grown steadily over time, because old vessels have been removed without being replaced with new ones.
It noted that none of the baden-Werttemberg crews did not enter into service within the Military Marine.
National Trust spys on the secret life of the lily
Our research that is carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands wants to reveal how the lilys use the surrounding environment to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that discoveries will reveal new things about the behavior of these unpublished flying mammals and will help future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will examine the common petals and petals, as well as the eardrums and water petals in the Inverewe Gardens of Western Ross.
Special recording equipment will be located in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the auctions during the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also carry out mobile studies using manual detectors.
The specialized audio analysis of all recordings will assess the frequency of the sounds made by the lilys and what species emits certain sounds.
They will be produced and a map of the habitat and a report to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a Nature Conservation Consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal what habitat areas are most important for pets and how they are used in each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of the area, and which is the best way to maintain forest pastures for pets and other associated species.
The lily populations in Scotland and throughout Britain have fallen considerably in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the cubes, but also by loss of habitat.
And the wind turbines and the public lighting are risks, as are the mosquito traps and some chemical treatments for building materials, but also the attacks of domestic cats.
In fact, lilys are not blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching the guard.
They use sophisticated echoing techniques to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is very serious about lilys.
They have ten trained experts, who carry out periodic studies, control the cubes and sometimes perform rescue missions.
The organization created even the first and only reservation of lilys in Scotland, on the Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, where there are eight of the ten lily species in Scotland.
Mose's manager, David Thompson, says that this is the ideal territory for pets.
"Here, in Thrave, the area is wonderful for the little ones," he says.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there are many things we don't know about little girls, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need to multiply."
It underlines the importance of seeking lilacs before carrying out maintenance work on the property, as simple unintended destruction of a maternal cube could kill up to 400 women and chickens, which can destroy the entire local population.
Lilies are protected, and killing, mapping or disturbing them, as well as destroying their cubs, are prohibited actions.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official in the Battle Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help him.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about the bats and we do not know how the populations evolve for many of our species.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers prepare to give the German magazine a trial
Cristiano Ronaldo said the charges against him are "face news" and that some people "will make a claim" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to refer to the German journal Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The attack by Portugal and the Juventus team was accused of violating a woman in America, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported Friday that the footballer paid her $375.000 to not talk about the incident.
A few hours after the charges were published, in a video posted on Instagram Live for the 142 million followers of his, Ronaldo, aged 33, said they are "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the golden balloon winner in front of the video camera.
"I want him to make his ad using my name.
It's normal.
They want to make it through my name, but I'm used to it.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to refer Der Spiegel to the court on the basis of these charges, which they called "an unacceptable report of suspicions of private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player will apply for compensation for "a sum equivalent to an appropriate amount for the seriousness of the act, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009, in an apartment at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he violated an anal, according to documents submitted to the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that, after an incident, Ronaldo fell into her knees and told her that she was "a good boy" in proportion to "99%", and that she was betrayed by "a percentage".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual relations with the accused, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga claims that she addressed the police and that the photographs of her injuries were taken to the hospital, but later she accepted an understanding outside the courtroom because she was "defeated by the possibility of revenge" and was concerned that "it would be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman is now looking to cancel that understanding because she continues to be traumatized by an accident.
At the time of the charge, Ronaldo was about to transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to the Italian youth giant, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK "and regret forever" car manufacturers' loss
Britain "will regret forever" if it loses world leader in car production after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
It added that it is "anxious" that Toyota UK has told the BBC that, if Britain comes out of the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese auto producer said that the impact of delays on the border in the case of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where the brands Auris and Avensis of Toyota are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, the production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, said they are afraid of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the Oxford factory where the Mini model is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what producers call risks associated with the supply chain in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line operates on the basis of the "fix-to-time" principle: for control-made machines, the pieces reach 37-minute intervals from British and EU suppliers.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems at the border could arise which, according to industrial producers, could cause delays and a lack of play.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more of the inventory for a day at his factory in Derbyshire, the company says, so the production would be stopped.
Clark said the Theresa May Chequers plan for future EU relations is "calibrated precisely to avoid these delays at the border".
"There must be an agreement. We want to have the best agreement, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the present, but also to benefit from this opportunity," he told the BBC Radio Today.
"The evidence from not only from Toyota, but also from other producers, shows that we must be able to continue using what was a very successful supply chain set."
Toyota could not specify how long production would have to be stopped, but warned that large prices could reduce the competitive capacity of the long-term factory and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is responsible for the United Union at the factory, said that members are increasingly concerned: "The experience has taught me that, after the loss, these jobs are no longer coming back."
A spokesperson of the government said: "I have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "a further week" because the fight for Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court, continues, said the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's electoral interference, the links between Trump's and Russia's assistance and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
The rumors about the possibility of Trump giving up the Deputy Attorney General, thus endangering Mueller's independence, circled around Washington for months.
At the beginning of the month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through Amendment 25 to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein rejected this report.
But last month he went to the White House, and the reports say he was about to resign.
Instead, it was announced for Thursday a meeting with Trump, which was then at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would prefer not" to grant Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's legal commission hearing, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
Friday, Trump requested a week's FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which again delayed the Senate's vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared at Fox News on Sunday.
Asking about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It may be this week or a week, taking into account all the other things that are happening now in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press up."
Some reporters would question this claim: Sanders no longer had a press briefing at the White House on September 10th.
Mr. Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that reducing the number of briefings was not caused by antipathy to TV reporters, who liked to be shown, although he added: "I don't deny that they like to be shown."
Then, he suggested he would increase direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president participates in several questions and answers sessions than all previous presidents," she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: "I have analyzed the figures."
"I'll have some more briefings," Sanders said, but "it's much better for the press to have the opportunity to address the President's questions directly, not me.
We're trying to do this most often and you've noticed that I've done this many times in the last few weeks, and discussions with the presidents of the United States will replace press briefings when it's available."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open sessions or press conferences with his visitors.
The press conferences granted exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this is happening, with an improvised appearance, on bizarre slogans, in front of the assembled reporters.
A Secretary of State of the Ministry of Health addressed in a letter to EU employees from the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland on Brexit-related issues
The Secretary of State wrote to EU employees working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express their gratitude for the country and their desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Parliament of Scotland, has sent the letter under the conditions of less than six months until the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to bear the costs of requests for permanent residence status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, waiting for decisions to be taken this autumn.
However, the UK government has begun to prepare itself more and more for a different scenario, in which there would be no agreement for leaving the EU.
I know it's a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate my appreciation for each employee's contribution, regardless of nationality.
Members of the European Union, but also outside it, have valuable experience and skills that enhance and improve the health service activity and also benefit the patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie is undergoing an emergency surgery after he has suffered a headache
The Tennessee State Tigers Foundation, Christian Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after he suffered a blow on Saturday, in the match his team lost in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores team, with a score of 31-27, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Senior Coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the strike took place shortly before the break.
"He reached the pipe line and simply collapsed," Reed said.
Abercrombie has put the oxygen mask by physical and medical professionals on the line before placing it on a plate and transporting it from the ground for a detailed assessment.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had come out of the operation he was subjected to at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are not yet any details of the type/extension of the accident" and that Tennessee State is trying to understand when it happened.
Abercrombie, a student in year 2, is in his first season at Tennessee State after he moved from Illinois.
On Saturday, it managed to make five plates in total before leaving the game, reaching a number of 18 plates throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will receive a higher court fee for buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will pay a higher court fee on the purchase of a property in the United Kingdom, following that additional money will be used to help homeless people, according to the new plans of the Conservative Party
This change will neutralize Corbyn's efforts to attract young people with the right to vote
Jurisdictional tax will apply to persons who are not paying taxes and taxes in the United Kingdom
The treasure store is expected to reach 120 million pounds a year for the help of homeless people
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher rate of stamp tax on the purchase of property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, as theresa May is to be announced today.
The exchange will be considered an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young people with the right to vote, promising houses with more favourable prices and visiting people with high incomes.
The higher judicial fee will be applied to natural and legal persons who are not taxpayers of taxes and taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money thus obtained will be used to support the Government's efforts to help homeless persons.
Suprataxa, which adds to the current court fee, including the levels raised two years ago for the second property and the properties purchased for rent, could reach a value of 3%.
The treasury expects this change to bring up to 120 million pounds per year.
About 13% of the new properties built in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for those who want to buy their first house.
More prosperous areas in the country, especially capital, have become "fantsome" due to the high number of foreign buyers spending a large part of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the tax on stamps to help young people buy their first house.
It accused large construction firms of maintaining high property prices as a result of the acquisition of land without using them and asked Theresei May to give up tax on affordable houses in order to solve the "house problem" in the UK.
Corbyn announced a series of attractive property reform proposals, including rent control and the cessation of unfavourable evacuations.
He also wants to offer the councils greater power in building new houses.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate myself to the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
And that means remedying existing problems on the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies with offices abroad, to be able to buy homes as easily as British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of holding a house has become a very far away one, and living under insanity is too real."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to be the manager of Scotland's national team"
Jack Ross, the Sunderland football team manager, said that "the ultimate goal" was to become, at a given time, Scotland's national team manager.
The Scottish, 42-year-old, enjoys the challenge of "rehabilitating" the North-Estonian club, which is currently on the 3rd place in the First League, with a three-point difference to the first place.
He moved to the team at the Luminian Stadium this summer after he managed last season to return to the St. Mirren football team in the first Scottish Premiership division.
"I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
I'm on national team B and so on," Ross told the BBC Sports Sound.
"But I spent a lot of my childhood chasing Scottish matches at Hampden with my father and I always wanted to come back.
But I will have this opportunity only if I succeed as the club manager."
Among Ross' predecessors, as Sunderland club managers, are Dick Moyes, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of the Alloa Athletic club said he had no emotion to be the successor of such a dedicated name and to a club so important, after refusing offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The only thing that worries me and that could affect my success is the question "Can I help this team get back to the Premier League?"
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities in this club allow it to be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to make it there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel a successful man is to contribute to the club's return to the Premier League."
Ross has only three years' experience in driving, after a period when he was assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of Hearts training staff.
Then she helped the club Alloa come back after she got back to Division C and managed to save St. Mirren from the retrograde, helping the team win the championship title next season.
Ross said he's feeling better now than his entire career player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was a crucial moment," he said about taking over the leader of the Alloa club.
“I even thought that I was more suited to the manager’s role than the player.
Maybe it sounds weird, because I had a good time, I won well and I had a few successful moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them weekly.
I'm dealing with situations similar to the manager, in terms of stress and pressure, but I feel that it's the right role for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now, that I can do this, I feel it's the best thing I've ever had in my adult life."

The ideal time to drink a bottle of beer is Saturday at 17:30, according to a poll
The heat wave this summer led to an increase in revenue in the British pubs, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
According to the figures, pubs and bars recorded an increase of 2.7% in July, while restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a representative of the CGA company providing business consulting services and carrying out the survey, said: “The constant heat and participation of England in the World Cup for a longer period than the proposed one contributed to a type in July, similar to that of the previous month, when the pubs recorded up to 2.8% more customers, while the restaurants had a worse period.
The number of customers with 1.8% in the restaurant industry in June has decreased even more in July.
Pubs and bars serving only drinks recorded a much larger profit than restaurants.
And the pubs that serve food recorded losses caused by heat, but not as large as restaurants.
Looks like people went out into town just to consume drinks.
Drink sales at the level of all bars and pubs increased by 6.6% this month, and food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, a representative of the RSM company that provides services in the hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we have observed since the end of April.
Meteorological conditions and the impact of sporting and social events remain among the most important factors contributing to the sales associated with the OOH advertising market.
It is no wonder that restaurants continue to record losses, although the decrease in sales by 4.8% year will add to current cost pressures.
The summer summer can't come at a worse time for food industry operators and only time will decide whether the moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news."
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including the new ones opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the small number of new locations launched.
The company that monitors sales of pubs, bars and restaurants in the United Kingdom, Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyzes the performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of over 9 billion pounds, being the official industry standard.
One of the five children has a secret account on a socialization network hidden by parents
According to a survey, one of five children, some even up to 11 years of age, has a secret account on a socialization network hidden by parents and teachers
A survey conducted at the level of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in Insta's false accounts
Awareness has increased concerns about sexual content posts
20% of students said they have a "principal" account showing their parents
One of five children, some even up to 11 years of age, creates an account on a socialization network that keeps him hidden from adults.
A survey conducted on a number of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in Insta's false accounts, referring to the Instagram photo sharing platform.
The knowledge increased the fears about sexual content posts.
20% of students said that they have a "main" and "clean" account that they show their parents, but that they also have other private accounts.
A mother, who mistakenly discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, observed the position of a teenager who asked to be "violated".
According to research conducted by the Digital Awareness Company of the United Kingdom and the Association of Directors (HMC – Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference) of independent schools, 40% of young people between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, and half of them have acknowledged that they have secret accounts.
HMC Association Director Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers do not have access."
Elind Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Commission
Elid Doyle was elected as Director, without executive power, of the Scottish Athletics Commission, at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated field and track athlete in Scotland, and Ian Beattie, president, described the change as a great opportunity for those who make decisions about sports activities to benefit from the vast experience it has gained at international level over the past decade.
"Eilid enjoys respect for the entire community of athletes in Scotland, the UK, as well as the whole world and we are sure that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits with its inclusion in the commission," Beattie said.
Doyle also said: "I am glad that I can represent athletes and hope to have a real contribution and be able to help the way sports activities take place in Scotland."
The American Nationality athlete, who won 200 and 400 meters of evidence at the 1996 Atlanta Games, along with the four gold medals won at the Olympic Games, is now a frequent commentator at the BBC, remains invalid after he suffered a transitional ischemic attack.
It says on Twitter: “After a month, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would decide whether I would recover or to what extent.
It was a Titanic job, but I recovered completely, I learned to go again, and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
A breast pump advertisement that compares women with cows divides public opinion online
A health-supply company has caused the division of public opinion in the online environment with an ad that compares mothers who breast-feed with cow breeding.
To mark the launch of a pump that wants to be "the first silent and portable breast pump in the world", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ironic advertisement, inspired by a music video clip, to present the freedom the new pump offers to nursing mothers.
Four real moms dance in a cowhouse full of cows on a melody that includes verses such as: "Yes, I'm soft, but I don't have a tail" and "if you haven't noticed, they're not ugly, they're my tits."
The report goes on to say: "I'm pumping, pumping, breast-feeding, pumping, pumping, milking from girls."
However, the claim, published on the company's Facebook page, has raised controversy in the online environment.
With 77,000 visualizations and hundreds of comments, the video was aimed at mixed reactions from those who saw it, many of them stating that it takes out the "ororor" of the dairy industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must remain pregnant and be born to produce milk, except that they are stolen from their children only a few days from birth," one person wrote.
Elvie breast pump fits discreetly in a breast support (Elvie/mamma)
Another commented: “It is understandable how traumatic it is for both mother and child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "An extremely inappropriate advertising."
Other people defended the claim, one person claiming that it seemed to him as a "hilar."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought one if I was still breast-feeding.
The pump really made me feel like a witch.
The claim is a bit inappropriate, but I took it as such.
But the product is great," wrote one person.
Another person commented: “It’s a fun advertisement targeting mothers who use the pump (desiring at work or in the toilet) and who feel like “students”.
It's not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women's group reveals that they danced with discreet pumps introduced into the support.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use breast pump say they feel like neighbors.
But Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and is discreetly fit in a breast support, offering women freedom of movement, the possibility of holding children in their arms and even getting out of town while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, partner, consultant and developer in design at Mother commented: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and challenging launch.
Comparing mothers who milk cows and milk cows, we wanted to highlight what the use of a breast pump and the challenges in this regard, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump will give.
It's not the first time Elvie's pump gets on the first page.
During the presentation of the fashion designer Marta Jakubowski at the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were transferred to hiding in a refugee camp at the border with Texas
The number of migrant children detained has increased, although the number of people who have crossed the border each month has remained relatively the same, largely because the rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by Trump administration have led to the acceleration of the child placement procedure in sponsors.
Many sponsors are usually themselves immigrants without documents and are afraid that they will be in danger of staying in the country if they ask to take children.
The risks increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, should register their prints and that their data will be communicated to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Customs and Immigration Authority, told Congress that the agency had arrested ten people who had requested the sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
"Approximately 80% of those who are sponsors or members of the sponsor's family live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign offenders.
Which means we will continue to look for those individuals," Albence said.
In order to accelerate the process in the child system, the authorities have introduced new rules according to which children must be present in court at a month of detention, and not at 60 days as provided for by the previous standard, according to the shelter employees.
Many will plead for the case through a video call, not personally in front of an immigration judge, to request the status of legal resident.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they can become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or escape attempts, according to the system’s shelters and reports in recent months.
Lawyers have said that these concerns are accentuated to a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility that signs indicating that a child has problems are not observed due to the size of the unit.
They added that the transfer of children to refugee camps without providing them enough time for emotional preparation or to take advantage of friends could cause them trauma, many of which are already suffering.
Syria calls for US, French and Turkish military forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouleem asked Syrian refugees to return home, although Syria is in war for eight years.
Mouleem, who is also the interim prime minister, said that foreign military forces are illegally located in a Syrian territory under the pretext of the fight against terrorism and that "the situation will be adequately managed".
"This must be withdrawn immediately and without any condition," he said at the meeting.
Moualem stressed that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011, and millions of people were displaced from their homes.
It further stated that Damascus will continue "this sacred battle until we remove terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories".
There are about 2,000 military troops in Syria in the United States, which are particularly involved in training and advising the Kurdish and arable forces in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
There are also more than 1,000 French military troops in the war-split country.
With regard to the refugee problem, Moualem stated that there are conditions for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "dissemination of Iraqi fears", which led refugees to keep the distance.
It added: "I have asked for the support of the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return."
"Political influences are brought into a problem that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the war-end opposition.
United Nations diplomats say that a recently concluded agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to remove the last group of rebels has created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has helped to prevent a large-scale assault by the Syrian forces, supported by the Russians, on the province in which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadline" and expressed hope that the military action will target the jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, which have links to the Al-Qaeda network and which will "be eradicated".
The staff of Mistura, the United Nations envoy, hopes to meet soon at the first meeting of a new committee formed by members of the government and opposition to the drafting of a post-war constitution for Syria and to prepare the field for elections.
Moualem presented the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the activities of the committee should be limited to "revision of the current constitution" and issued an intervention warning.
Why will Trump win the second term
If we were to take this logic, Trump would be real in 2020, unless the dismissal procedure or scandals would end his term of president earlier, which much of the liberal audience hopes to happen.
In this case, it would no doubt be "the most dramatic end of a presidential term of all time!"
Until now, it seems that the audience is still interested in the subject.
Since 2014, first-time audits have doubled to CNN, reaching 1.05 million and nearly tripled to MSNBC, reaching 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, in the early days, the TV post Fox News has been monitored, on average, by 2.4 million people, over the past four years when it was followed by 1.7 million, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" from MSNBC has recorded an audience record, with 3.5 million people who have followed it in the series in which important news was broadcast.
"This is a subject that attracts the public, because we cannot understand it," said Neal Baer, the producer of the ABC's dramatic series "Chairman of Reserve", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with a wide experience in the field and the car of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snaging Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She recalls a taxi trip through Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote with Trump.
Why did she ask.
"He said, 'For making me laugh,' said Scovell.
In chaos, entertainment is being valued.
Of course, unlike anything else broadcast on TV, the action being taken in Washington could determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, whether the immigrant families can be whole and about the state of the global economy.
Exchange of position is a luxury that can only be allowed by the privileged public.
However, you are not only an informed citizen when you arrive at the sixth hour of the debate by a committee of experts how Bob Woodward uses deep background sources for his book, Fair, about Paul Manafort's $15,000-skin jacket (a "opulent clothing object", according to The Washington Post) and the implications of the shocking performance of Stormy Daniels on Trump's "anatomical parts".
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario in the same way.
"A large part of what makes you feel like watching a reality show and feeding you with subjects every night," said Brent Montgomery, the executive director of the Media Group Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the "Ashii Amanet," about the constantly changing distribution and the daily disturbances caused by Trump (the launch of a fight with the American professional football league, the praise given to Kim Jong-Un).
Don't let yourself lose an episode, because you'll feel you're behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week in his home from the northern part of the Kauai island, there were 27 degrees outside and there was sun, and he was sitting inside looking at MSNBC and recording from the CNN.
It could not be disbanded in front of the television, especially while Brett Kavanaugh was going to face the Senate's legal commission and was going to decide on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember doing some shows out of the past, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they seemed to be right."

Complementary external financial resources for the closest intermediation elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a realisation of electoral districts, which resulted in two mandate holders in an electoral course for the same function, it is not surprising that the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania enjoys comprehensive financial resources.
Thus, the new suburb of Pittsburgh has brought in Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won, in another district, the special elections last spring.
Lamb is running against another mandate holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the 12th electoral district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps significantly with the 17th.
Election cards were reconfigured after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were not constitutional and that the boundaries of the districts were manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The 17th New Electoral District race launched a competition in funding campaigns between major party funding agencies, the Congress Committee for the Campaign of Democrats (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election, which took place in March for the 18th electoral district of the state of Pennsylvania.
For over a decade the function was occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won this district with a 20-point difference.
According to political commentators, democracies enjoy an easy advantage.
The United States took into account the penalisation of El Salvador because of its understanding with China, but then abandoned
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with the President of the Republic of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the Trump Steering Team.
The State Department officials decided to call the US heads of the diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," said Heather Nauert, the spokesman of the department in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions against the state of El Salvador were considered, which received US aid worth approximately US$ 140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in financial assistance and visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and the high rate of unemployment and its crimes.
As internal meetings have progressed, North American and Central American officials have delayed a high-level conference, focused on security and economic prosperity, to continue a similar meeting last year, considering a step forward in preventing migrants from being directed to the United States.
But by the mid-September, officials in front of the administration made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively finishing any examination of the sanctions for El Salvador.
It is now planned that Vice-President Mike Pence address the conference, scheduled in mid-October, to highlight the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats have declared.
And the three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving new messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman of the White House for John Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if they were kept anonymous.
Their reports were co-ordinated by an external analyst, who is a close to the administration and who also spoke on condition that the anonymity is kept.
History study
The next thing that could happen is the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, about which there are now strong public evidence.
It also appears that Mueller is directing his investigation and investigation into the existence of a conspiracy between Trump and Russia regarding the attack on the US elections.
If the Congress changes, Trump will face the appropriate responsibility within the body, even when he is prepared to present himself before the electors and, if possible, a jury formed by his colleagues.
There are many possible situations and I do not want to suggest that Trump's "fall" is inevitable, and it is also valid for its homologies in Europe.
There are elections that we all have to make on the one hand and on the other of the Atlantic that will decide the duration of the investigation.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to give a coup against Hitler, only if the West had opposed and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
I failed and lost such an opportunity to avoid the massacre years that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans face a few such critical moments right now.
What will we do if Trump resigns Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since he reported in this newspaper last year that he suggested the President's secret registration and speculated about his incompatibility with the role of president.
Rosenstein said the report of the Times was incorrect.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Research Office regarding Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if it is confirmed at the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the middle of the election for a Congress that will take him to the task of Trump?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, after the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew of Czechoslovakian origin who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence.
He survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, he sent me to light up Saturday's candles on the table with the bells.

Player Graham Dorrans from the Rangers team is optimistic about the game with Rapid Vienna
Thursday, Rangers will be the host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that the victory in the match with the Austrians, after Spain's impressive equality against the Villareal team from the beginning of the month, will put it in a strong position to qualify as a Group G of the European League.
An accident on the knees did not allow middleman Graham Dorrans to play in this season until 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers team can use this result in its advantage to achieve better performance.
"It was a good point for us, given that Villarreal is a good team," said the player at the age of 31.
"We started the game thinking we'd get a good result and we won a point.
I probably could've written it down at the end, but, in total, I think the equation was a correct result.
I think they were better at first replay, and we noticed better at the second.
Thursday, it will be an important evening for Europe again.
With little luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they have had a good result in the last game played. However, with the support of the supporters, we will certainly feel and more motivated and we will have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, taking into account my accidents and changes from the club, but the situation is better at the moment.
The team is good and the boys really like to be here; training also goes well.
Let's hope we're going to endure, we're going to leave the past season behind, and we're going to have good results."
Women have insomnia due to pension economies
Despite the fact that the survey participants knew clearly how to be concerned, a few people talked to family members about this.
About half of those who participated in the study conducted by the Nationwide company said that they discussed the long-term cost of care with their spouse.
Only 10% of them said they talked to their children about this subject.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but do not initiate this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Company.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to give you the care you need if you do not know your wishes from time to time.
You work with the consultant and the family to discuss the place and how you will get the care, as these choices could be a significant factor for determining costs.
Involve the financial adviser: and the financial adviser can be a real help with regard to the payment of these expenditures.
Your long-term funding choices can include a standard long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy in cash, to help you cover these expenses or you can ensure your own well-being – to the extent that you have the money.
Put your legal documents to the fore: you are in the midst of legal problems.
Get confirmation of medical decisions, to designate a trusted person who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals in the field respect your wishes if you cannot communicate with them.
Consider, too, the implementation of a mandate on your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that you have the facts, if you do not have the capacity to do so.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that a parent of yours with an advanced age has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Note these details in a written plan to be prepared.
"And it's not all just about the financial side. Can you tell who the doctors are taking care of it?" asked Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who will take care of his dog?
Draw up a plan on all these things."

A man was shot several times with a compressed air rifle while going home after a night in the city.
The victim, at the age of 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the incident, which took place at 02:30, as "accidental shootings".
The victim couldn't see his attacker.
Pains don't put his life in danger, and the police have called on witnesses to make statements.
Storms and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died from a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, according to the authorities, and the number of deaths is expected to rise.
Due to the interruption of communications networks, the disaster management authorities were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of the city of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key information about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of the centre of the island of Sulawesi, which is at the end of a narrow golf course on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated 40 years of existence when it was hit by tsunamis and earthquakes.
Dongala is a region on a coast with a area of more than 300 km north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, an administrative region located below a province, has a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture activities are the central point of the economy of the province of the centre of the island of Sulawesi, in particular of the coastal region of Dongala.
Mining activities for the extraction of nickel are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused death to more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
Also in 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of the Dongala Regency, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Circle, an area with intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the disasters and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of the island of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half being from Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes struck the west coast of the island of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias, along the coast of the island of Sumatra.
2006: a 6.8-degree earthquake on the Richter scale struck south of the most populous Indonesian islands, Java, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: a 7.6-degree earthquake on the Richter scale took place near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Sumatra de West.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: a 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale struck one of the islands of Mentawai, along the coast of the island of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami with a height of up to 10 meters, which destroyed ten villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: a low-intensity earthquake occurred in the Pidie Jaya kingdom of Aceh, causing damage and panic, as people remembered the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004, which fought with a large number of deaths.
This time a tsunami didn't start, but more than 100 people died because of broken buildings.
2018: several strong storms took place on the tourist island Lombok, causing the death of more than 500 people, most on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists temporarily blocked under damage.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested following allegations of violence.
Palin, aged 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under the suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a domestic violence claim and in opposition to arrest, according to a report published by the police in Alaska on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a knowledge of this female woman tried to call the police to claim the alleged crimes, she picked up her phone.
Palin is in the custody of the police, at the Mat-Su unit, awaiting the trial, and is held on the basis of a depositless bank, worth $500, according to the KTUU.
It was presented on Saturday in court, where "100% innocent" was declared when the petition was made, according to the network.
Palin faces three charges of Class A offences, which means he could be imprisoned for a period of up to a year and fined $250,000.
They have also been charged with a class B offence, which is punishable by a day in prison and an amendment of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin's been charged with such charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to announce alleged aggression.
The case is being brought before the Alaska Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, involving a claim for domestic violence and possession of a weapon while in a state of drunkenness in connection with an incident.
According to his lover's statement, she gave him a punch.
Sarah Palin was criticized by the veteran groups in 2016 after her son’s violent behavior was associated with the post-traumatic stress syndrome he suffered after being part of the military forces in Iraq.
Storms and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of dead people
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are broken down and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake occurred along the central province of Sulawesi, located in the north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On socialization networks, video clips are circulating that present the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
The federal prosecution wants a capital punishment for the suspected terrorist attack in New York City
The New York Federal Prosecutor wants a capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City after which eight people were killed, a rare sentence that was no longer applied in the state for a 1953 federal offence.
It seems that Saipov, at the age of 30, used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a West Side motorway, from the Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on his trip, in October.
In order to justify capital punishment, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov has "intendedly killed" the eight victims and caused "intendedly" serious bodily injuries, according to the intentional opinion on the request for capital punishment, filed in the South District of New York.
Both defendants may receive a capital sentence, according to the court's document.
In a few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury accused Saipov of 22 counts of charges involving eight counts of crime in support of organised crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as a charge of violence and the destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required a "substantial planning and premedication", the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov acted as "hate, cruel and devious".
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, suffering and loss to families and friends of the following: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the opinion of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the last trial of a case of capital punishment in the South District of New York.
The priest, Khalid Barnes, was accused of murdering two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last capital punishment applied in a New York federal case took place in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after being convicted of conspiracy in the conspiracy commission for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Rosenberg's wives were executed on the electric seat on 19 June 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no regret in the days and months following the attack.
He testified to the investigators that he liked what he did, according to the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to execute the attack after looking at the video clips of the ISIS group on his phone, according to the applicant.
Also, according to the police, he asked to tree the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He pretended innocent with respect to the 22 counts of charges.
David Patton, one of the defenders in the office who represented Saipov, said they are "evidently disappointed" of the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply the capital penalty, instead of accepting a life imprisonment plea, without any possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all the persons involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team previously asked the prosecutors not to apply the capital punishment.
A member of Parliament who is a member of the Conservative Party argues that NIGEL FARAGE must be at the forefront of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today that he would "mobilize the civilian army", during a protest at the Conservative Party's conference.
Ukip's former leader stated that politicians must "sympathize" with Eurosceptics, following the statement of a member of Parliament Therese May who suggested that it should be in the face of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative Party, said at a demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be out" until now if Farage was secretary in the Brexit campaign.
But the challenge that May faces in terms of the extremely divided camps was stressed by the members of the Conservative Party who joined another protest, against the European Union's departures organised in the city.
The Prime Minister seeks to ensure that his compromise plan, called the Chequers plan, is properly carried out, facing the attacks of those who support the withdrawal of the European Union, those who want to remain in it and the European Union.
The alliances stressed that it will continue to try to conclude an agreement with Brussels, regardless of the consequences, and will force the Eurosceptics and the Labourist Party to choose between its offer and its 'chaos'.
Bone said in the event of the pro-Brexit move "Leave Means Leave" in Solihull that she wants "refused to the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and be given the responsibility associated with the negotiations with Brussels.
"If things were led by him, I was no longer in the European Union," he said.
The Conservative Member of Parliament, the representative of the Wellingborough constituency, added: "I support Brexit, but we must give up the Chequers plan."
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: "I have not fought in world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the suggestions for changing public opinion to the 2016 vote: "It is not true that the British have changed their mind and want to remain in the Union."
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party that supports Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: "I just want to say so: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the voices of people.
"The public does not agree with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party does not agree with it and neither our activists who go out and support us, first and foremost, in elections.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message aimed at Theresa May, she added: "The prime ministers who keep their function are those who respect their promises."
During the meeting, Nigel Farage said politicians should be put in a position to "sympathize the pressure" if they are about to give up the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It's a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"He's starting to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them that "we won't let them do this."
In a message sent to the enthusiastic thanks, he added: “You want to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
"We mobilize the civilian army of the country that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-government and proud UK."
Meanwhile, those who support the stay in the European Union marched through Birmingham two hours before a meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists raised a ban on "The Conservative Party is against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at the members of the Conservative Party and the security problems they faced in the party's application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can implement IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for digitising customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a farce.
Brexit doesn't bring any benefits," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously about running for the presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the United States said he would seriously consider running for the presidency after the November elections.
According to the Boston Globe newspaper, the democratic senator of Massachusetts spoke on Saturday about her future during a meeting of the primacy in the West of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for the November elections against Geoff Diehl, a member of the Chamber of Representatives of the Republican Party, who was co-chaired by Donald Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It was in the centre of speculation which could defeat Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was a meeting with the number 36 with citizens with the right to vote using the format of the primacy since Trump took over the presidency.
One participant asked her if she was going to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come for "women to reach Washington to solve the problems of our seriously affected government, and this included finding a woman in his face."
A suspect was arrested in the event of a death caused by the player Sims from the LSU team
The Baton Rouge police, Los Angeles, announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the event of a death that caused the death of LSU's Wayde Sims basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They published a video material at the time of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man in the pictures.
Sims, at the age of 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death," said police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday for 247 sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the spot, that he was in possession of a gun, but also that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was taken into police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a junior player, with a height of 1.98 m, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 matches, being 10 times in the original batch in the last season and playing on average 17.4 minutes with 5.6 points and 2.9 matches.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after the team helps him win in front of Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the time that Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders given by the Mercedes team will play an essential role in the process.
Based on the first position in the ranking, Bottas had a good start and nearly defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two tours and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop the box and leave Hamilton at the group's tail, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped at the box later and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to proceed after a few schemes that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the interior free, after making a double move to defend himself on the third row.
Max Verstappen started the race on the back of the wagon and was in the seventh place near the end of the first tour, even on the day he was 21 years old.
Then he stood in the front for a large part of the race, looking at a quick finish and trying to beat Kimi Raikkonen and take the fourth place.
Finally, he stopped at the 44th tour box, but he couldn't make a big move in the last eight tours, Raikkonen remaining in place four.
“It was a difficult day. Valtteri did an exceptional job all weekend and acted like a true gentleman, letting me go in front.
And the team did an excellent job to get the victory in front of the Ferraris and to achieve this double," Hamilton said.
A Terrible Body Language
President Donald Trump ironied Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday, as part of a meeting on his insistences, as she did not facilitate Christine Blasey Ford's letters, which accused Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court, of sexual aggression.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are "living, immoral and lying".
"The only thing that could happen is the beautiful thing that happens in the last days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and angry and immoral and lying," he said.
"When you see that they published and published information and then say they didn't.
They're not the responsible ones.
Do you remember?
When did I ask Diane Feinstein if she made it easier to "get out" the document?
Do you remember her answer?
Uh... no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
No, I didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent to the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was "suffered" in September, but Feinstein denied that "suffering" occurred in her office.
"I didn't hide the accusations about Ford and I'm not the one that made it easier to "get away" her relationship," Feinstein told the commission, according to Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep the confidentiality and that's exactly what I did."
However, her denial does not seem to have been well spoken to the president, who commented during the Saturday’s meeting: “If I am honest, it was a terrible body language.
Maybe she didn't, but she was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continually defending the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that democracies use accusations to achieve their own ends.
“They are determined to take power in any possible way.
Notice the evil, the immorality, they don't care who they hurt and who they have to destroy to get power and control," the president said, according to the Mediate website.
Elite League: Team Stars in Dundee wins with 5-3 in front of Giants in Belfast
Patrick Dwyer wrote two goals for Giants against the Dundee team
The Dundee Stars team paid for losing Fridays in the Elite League, winning before the giants in Belfast in the back game on Saturday, with a score of 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants team had an advance of two goals, the hits being executed by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equaled the score before Dwyer brought Giants back to the side of the side team.
Francois Bouchard equaled the score for Dundee before two goals marked by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen to ensure their victory.
It was the third defeat of the elite League of this season for the players of Adam Keefe, who recovers the ground by winning the team from Dundee on 2-1 Friday night.
It was the fourth season meeting between the two teams, Giants winning the last three matches.
Dwyer's opening performance was launched in the fourth minute, 3:35, from a Kendall McFaul pass, then David Rutherford passed decisively to Beauvillier who doubled the team's advantage four minutes later.
In a game that started so dynamic, Sullivan set up the host team in 13:10, before Matt Marquardt offered Cownie the opportunity to record for an equal score in 15:16.
Dwyer secured the advantage of the Giants team before the first break, when he entered his second goal at the end of the first break.
The host team regrouped and Bouchard re-equipped with an impressive goal at 27:37.
Later, in the second replay, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen gain an advantage for Dundee for the first time in that match, thus ensuring that the team went to 5th place in the class, at half the last replay.
The Giants team, who has now lost four of the last five matches, will be, Friday, host to Milton Keynes in their next match.
An air traffic controller died after ensuring the decommissioning of a plane with hundreds of passengers during a crash
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero, dying after he secured the decommissioning of a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after a strong earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There have been several powerful replicas in the area and many people are trapped under the rest of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, Antonius Gunavan Agung, at the age of 21, refused to leave his post from the tour of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu, which was awakened.
It remained in place to ensure that flight 6321 of the Batik Air company, which was on the track at that time, would derail safely.
Then he jumped out of the air control tower when he noticed that he was about to crash.
He died at the hospital later.
The spokesperson for Indonesia's air navigation service provider said it is possible that the decision would have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
We have prepared an helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, it died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We are suffering from this news," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, the national disaster management agency stating that access is limited in the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong.
"We believe that the number will increase, as many victims are still in ruins and we have not had access to many of them," said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves with a height of up to six meters devastated the city of Palu, on Sunday following a joint burial.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings victims.
It's almost impossible to find drinking water.
All the minimarkets are stolen."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told the CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is speeding up to offer help to survivors, but we do not know what they will find on the spot.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: "Please work day and night to carry out all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?", announced CNN.
Indonesia was shaken at the beginning of this year's earthquake in Lombok, which fought with more than 550 deaths.
Avian accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a person is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon
The airline holding the plane that crashed into a Pacific Ocean in Micronesia has now declared that a person is missing, after previously declared that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in a press release that a male passenger is missing from the afternoon of Saturday.
It also mentioned that it is trying to find a man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to recover the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Friday, the authorities said that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and exact order of the events.
The airline and the United States Naval Forces said the plane missed the landing track and arrived at a lake next to it.
Some witnesses think the plane was over the end of the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane reached a very small distance from the ground.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes also said that he and other passengers managed to cross the water, which reached the bridge, and reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the shipowners panicked and yelled and that he had suffered a minor injury to his head.
The Naval Forces of the United States said that the mariners who were working close to the refurbishment of a shipyard jumped in aid, using a flammable boat to transport people to the shore before the plane sinks to 30 metres below the water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people died in accidents by air companies registered in PNG over the last two decades, but none of them included an Air Niugini aircraft.
An analyst presents the night chronology in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution closed its plea concerning the resumption of the trial for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the United States Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in the information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used the mobile phone records to put Quinton Tellis' actions to head, at the age of 29, as well as those of his victim Jessica Chambers, at the age of 19, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night he was killed, this being in contradiction with his previous statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
The moment the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called in the witness box and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "had lied, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone records indicate that they were known for a week.
Rowlett said that, shortly after Chambers died, Tellis deleted the text messages, calls and contact details of Chambers from his phone.
"Deleted her from his life," Hale said.
According to the schedule, the defense will begin its final prayer Sunday.
The judge said he suggested that the jury would decide at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is the hip-hop conscious?
A trio that sings hip-hop music wants to change the negative way that this kind of music is seen, with the help of positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, argues that the hip-hop has stopped transmitting political messages and addressing social problems, as it did initially.
They want to return to the origins and make the hip-hop conscious to be popular again.
A recent rebirth of artists such as The Fugees and Commons in the United Kingdom was observed through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another color person?
A New Yorker judges a couple for having fired her after she received a "racist" text message.
A New York judge gives a couple for the award for discriminatory reasons after she has received a text message from her mother, complaining that it was "a person of color".
The couple denied that they were racist, claiming that she had been tried for "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her dismay when she found out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was colorful when she presented herself on the first day of work in 2016.
"NUUUUUUUU! IN A PERSON OF COLOURS," Plasco-Flaxman wrote his husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After she realized that she felt embarrassed, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that her uncle, who is an African-American, had not fulfilled his duties properly and that he was expected to receive a gift of Philippine nationality, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for the day of work and sent home with Uber.
Now, she judges the couple to pay compensation for the concession and asks for the amount of $350 per day for six months, the period during which they were to live with them and carry out their activities, despite the fact that this was done without a contract concluded.
"I want to show them that they don't do things like that," she said on Friday for the Post newspaper, adding "I know it's discrimination".
The couple denied the claims about being racist, saying it was a normal thing to fire Maurice, because they were afraid they could no longer trust her after they insulted her.
"My sister sent her a wrong message.
She's not a racist person.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco, his husband, for the Post newspaper.
"But would you leave your children on the hands of a person you have made a mistake about, even if it was wrong?
The newborn child?
Let's be serious."
Considering the process as an "extortion" action, Plasco said that his wife will be born in two months and that she is in a "very difficult situation".
“ Do you really want to avenge a person in such circumstances?
It doesn't do that," the bank investor added.
While the process is ongoing, the public opinion has accused the couple of socialization networks, judging them for the behavior and logic they have proved.
The editors of Paddington's stories feared that readers would not be able to identify themselves with a bear speaking, according to a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said about the letter: “It’s hard to get into the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It's very funny now, after I saw that Paddington had a huge success."
It further stated that his father, who was a cameraman for BBC before being inspired by a toy bear to write the book for children, would be optimistic about his rejection of his work, adding that the anniversary of the 60-year anniversary of the publication of books was a "sweet-sweet" after he died last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father had a discreet pride in the success she later enjoyed.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he didn't like to praise himself," she said.
"But, because Paddington was so real to him, it was like he had a child who had a success: you are proud of him, though it is not your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always used to give Paddington credit."
My daughter was dying and I had to take my phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was quickly transported to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life in the Zadar.
"No one often calls to tell me that it's very serious and that he doesn't think he'll survive," Ednan-Laperous said.
"Then I received a call from Nad telling me that he'll die in the next two minutes and that I have to take the rest of it.
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, "Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medications to keep her heart pumping blood began to decrease and get out of her body.
Dead a little while ago, and the organs began to fail.
I was forced to stay there and wait, aware of everything that's going on.
I couldn't scream or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I should've been in control."
Finally, Ednan-Laperous, being in mourning after his daughter's death, boarded the plane, along with other passengers, who did not know what he was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
“I held my head down and the tears did not stop running.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I had a overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
I realized he needed love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Two pregnant women place different messages on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost their loved ones because they killed themselves trying to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place various messages on a bridge in Gali Country, many of them being motivated and including phone numbers that people can call to get support.
Sharon Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45 years old, lives in Lydney and says that his son was going to be a promising cook with a soothing smile.
"Everyone appreciates his smile.
They always said his smile would change your mood."
However, he gave up his job before he died, because he arrived at a very unfortunate moment in his life.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother after he took his life.
Davis said: "I still think you will have a domino effect."
It created the messages “to tell people that I can call someone or even talk to someone, even with a friend.
Exterior yourself, you need to talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, Davies' friend for many years, lost Mark, the life partner he had for 15 years, at little time since his mother's death.
"He didn't tell me he's not feeling well or he's depressed," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, I noticed that she had changed her attitude.
She was in a deplorable state on Christmas, when the children made their presents and didn't even look into her eyes."
She said that her death was a terrible trauma to them, but she had to overcome it: “She caused a terrible pain within the family.
We're devastated.
But we have to go further and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake, as a result of the start of the investigation by the Federal Research Office
"I thought that if I could get something similar to what he asked – an investigation into a limited period of time and a reduced extent – I could have a little unity," Jeff Flake said Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the commission was about to "disintegrate", on the basis of a partial blocking.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is entirely due to the temporal factor.
There are only five weeks before the November 6 elections - if, as suggested, the Republicans have bad results, their attempts to place the one they want the winner of the elections for the highest court in the country will be significantly weak.
George W. Bush kept calling the senators to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI finalizes the report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently present.
It is not yet clear if Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to make the difference in the case of equality and confirm it at the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees falls under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came into power seven years ago, a South Korean MP said.
Byeong-seug Park, quoting data from the South Korea unification ministry, said last year they fled the country about 1,127 people, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were more stringent border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates perceived by those who transport illegal persons across the border.
The Phenian didn't make any public comments.
A large majority of North refugees are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seul officials declare that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the illegal border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of the refugees across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strong protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers refugees rather illegal migrants than refugees and often repatriates them.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still practically in war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met with Phenian for a few discussions on the negotiations on denuclearisation.
This took place after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-one in Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to cooperate for a Korean nuclear-weapon-free peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US sanctions of lack of progress since then.
"If we cannot trust the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security and, in such situations, we will in no case be the first to be unilaterally disappointed," Ri said in a speech addressed to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "steric", stating that he is unable to serve at the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the democratic minority in the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court as "steric" and said that his temper was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made comments on Saturday during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't think of the fact that if there was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared "historic," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate's legal commission, which took place on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the charges that Christine Blasey Ford was sexually assaulted when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screamed and lost his voice because of his emotions, while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the Commission, calling charges against him "a grotesque and coordinated murder", organised by the angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said it is of the opinion that Kavanaugh's testimony has shown that he cannot serve at the Supreme Court, because he has shown that he is a partisan against the Democrats.
"I think it is decalating with those statements and the way he attacked Clinton's family and democracies," she said.
Pelosi turned from the subject when he was asked if he would try to suspend Kavanaugh if it was confirmed and whether the Democrats would win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I just want to say this: if he does not tell the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then it is not appropriate, not only for the Supreme Court, but not for the court in which he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Appeal of the District of Colombia.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, he is concerned about the possible decisions of Kavanaugh against the Law which is accessible to care or Roe versus Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be reversed.
"It's not the right time to go to court and wait for us to say "woe! what a wonderful!" said Pelosi.
And women must be able to handle it.
It's a justified diagnosis, it's months and years of rage accumulated and it can't talk without crying out.
"We cry when we get angry," Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, right?"
She continued: “I received significant help from a woman who took on an executive role, who told me that she was crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique that, when she got angry and started to cry, she told the person she was talking to: “You might think I’m sad because you see me crying.
I'm nervous."
And then go on.
I thought it was a great thing."
The tears are allowed for the externalization of anger, partly because they are fundamentally wrong.
One of the clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, where I began to cry because of an unexpressable rage, is that I was caught by the head of an older woman, a cold director to whom I always felt a bit afraid, and took me to the house of the stairs.
"She must never see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
I think you're sad and they'll be glad they caused you this feeling."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat in Congress in the state of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at the presidential elections.
In 1987, when Hart was arrested for having an extra-marriage relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought he had no reason not to run for the presidency.
"It wasn't a very well thought-out decision," she says laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone referred to the situation as "White as White and the seven little ones".
Because the campaign was at the end, she was behind the fundraising and swore she wouldn't go into the race unless she managed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
He found that some of her supporters who gave the men $1,000, they only gave them $250.
"Do they think I'm getting reductions?" she asked.
During the speech he announced that he would not officially launch a company, it was so affected by emotions – as a result of recognition for the people who supported it, the frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, but also the anger caused by gender discrimination – that he lost his voice because of the emotions.
"You would have said I have a nervous crisis," Schroeder recalls about the press reactions to her.
"You would have said one of my sponsors is Kleinex."
I remember thinking about what they're going to write on my funeral rock.
"A cry?"
How can the commercial war between the United States and China be beneficial for Beijing?
Savings that announced the beginning of the trade war between the United States and China were absurd and, although there seems to be a long way to end it, disputes between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, first issued a warning early this year by imposing taxes on key imports from China, including solar, steel and aluminium panels.
The most important escalation took place this week with new taxes, which affected products worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds of sterling), effectively applying half of all goods in China that reach the United States.
Beijing has been remunerated every time, most recently imposing a fee of between $5 and 10% for American products worth $60 billion.
China has warned that it will respond to every hit from the United States and is unlikely to make the world's second largest economy a step back in the near future.
In order for Washington to withdraw, China must agree with its demands, but public surrender to the United States would be too humiliating for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing is playing its books well, the US trade war pressure could support China in a positive way in the long term, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would in fact be more dangerous than what has been suggested so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a group of experts.
Syria is ready to return refugees, Foreign Minister states
Syria claims that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by a war that lasts better than seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's situation is improving.
"Today, the conditions on the spot are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made to combat terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists so that things get back to normal.
The existing conditions allow the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country in 2011, when the war broke out.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mouleem said the Syrian regime would be pleased to receive help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsored by insurgents would not be accepted.
European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder 2018 Cup after winning the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National from the edge of the city of Paris, France.
The United States now recorded the sixth consecutive victory in Europe and no longer won the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe returned first after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team got 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who put incredible efforts in most of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial water blow to the wall 3 at the 16th of the gate, giving Francesco Molinari's match.
The Italian golfer Molinari has had an incredible performance in all the rewinds, becoming one of the four players with a result of 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was released in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5 and 4 holes in front of the player from the last place in the ranking of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen in Denmark.
The first player in the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost at Gates 2 and 1 in front of Ian Poulter in England, which is probably his last match from the Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, who participated in eight editions, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the European player with most victories, recording an average of 25.5 points throughout his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It was a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm extremely happy that I could win the cup again.
It's a team job and I'm glad I could be of help," said Garcia, excitedly after the European victory.
It teaches the sthafeth to his consonant John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at holes 2 and 1, at the individual game Sunday.
"I'm very proud I beat Tiger Woods. I used to chase the games when I was a kid," Rahm, 23 years old, said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 at the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 important titles, being only surpassed by Jack Nicklus.
All weekend, the American team put a real effort into the golf course, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played extraordinaryly throughout the tournament.
The captain of the American team, Jim Furyk, said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of them, they’ve done their best.
This morning, there were a few moments when I put pressure on the European team.
I went to a red fight.
Down the hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
I will work with the PGA of America and our Committee for the Ryder Cup and we will go further.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We must give them due respect.
They played better than us."
