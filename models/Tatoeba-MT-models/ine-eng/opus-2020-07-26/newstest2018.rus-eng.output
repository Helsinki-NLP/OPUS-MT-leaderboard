The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, signed the law on administrative liability for the violation of the time and order of payment of goods (work, services) in the conduct of procurement for public and municipal needs.
This law is designed to address the very acute problem of non-compliance with its obligations by contracting authorities in the implementation of public and municipal procurement.
Another two years ago, the situation where entrepreneurs were unable to receive remuneration under already implemented public and municipal contracts was widespread.
At that time, the President of Russia instructed the General Prosecutor ' s Office to take over the issue of special control.
Because businessmen themselves were unable to deal with unfavourable customers who had entered into unencumbered contracts, they were all trying to avoid paid obligations and included illegal terms in contracts.
The problem was systemic in general in the country.
Since 2015, 9.7,000 submissions have been made to protect the rights of entrepreneurs to receive public procurement orders by the Public Prosecutor's Office, with 4.5 thousand disciplinary officials being brought to the administrative office, 533, and 75 documents have been submitted to the investigating bodies for the purposes of conducting the investigations, 46 of which have been criminalized.
As a result, more than 66 billion rubles were committed in front of entrepreneurs.
Since these huge amounts have been accumulated far from the result of the non-payment of the multibillion-dollar contracts.
Baseline debt has resulted in numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs, where smaller amounts have been made.
This is a typical case.
The manager of the small company won a multi-million rubles social services competition.
Man has invested all his working resources, has fully fulfilled his obligations, but has not received the money in time.
The result is an increase in the financial debt of wages, taxes, loans that would lead to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur did not seek assistance from the prosecutor's office.
The problem has now been tackled as much as possible in a number of regions.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total debt for public and municipal contracts identified by the prosecutors of the Russian Federation amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt rates continue to reach critical values, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office is working under a hand-held anti-crisis management system.
The Attorney-General shall personally hold meetings with representatives of the local authority, which shall be substantively understood by all public prosecutors of violations and measures to remove them immediately.
Such operational meetings have already been held in Yaroslav and Ekaterinburg this year.
Quality improvements in public procurement will enable the implementation of Federal Law No. 189-FZ " On changes to the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation in the establishment of administrative responsibility of the contracting authority for the violation of the time and order of payment of goods (work, services) in procurement for public and municipal needs", which was signed by the President of Russia last week.
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economics of Russia on the initiative of the Office of the Secretary-General.
The new law will be supplemented by the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation, which provides for a fine of 30,000 to 50,000 rubles for a violation by an official of the time and order of payment of goods, works and services in public and municipal procurement.
And if the official has already been subject to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he is expected to be disqualified for one year to two years.
All the prosecutors of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure that these legislative novels are applied in practice.
The Civil Rights Protection Group announced a warning to move to Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of the Progress of the Coloured Population has issued a warning to the colouring people travelling to Missouri because of the State's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: “Providing the advance of the colouring population to travel to the National Association, effective 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travellers, guests and citizens of the State of Missouri to be particularly careful and to exercise increased caution in travel by the State in connection with a number of suspicious incidents on a racist basis recently occurring throughout the territory of the state and brought here”.
According to the National Association for the Promotion of the Progress of the Colouring Population, a recent legislation in Missouri called for the prevention of movement, which made it more difficult for people to win claims related to discrimination, as well as the fact that state law enforcement authorities are often disproportionately elected by their minority representatives.
“You people are being violated by human rights.
They are left on the streets because of the color of the skin, they are killed and killed," said the Kansas City Star newspaper Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colour People of Missouri.
“We hear complaints often, as never before.”
This is the first kind of warning announced by the organization against the United States.
The group referred to incidents such as the humiliation of black students on a racial basis at the University of Missouri and the death of twenty-eight-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he had finished gas during his trip to the state, and the state police arrested him without charge.
The warning also mentions the recent report by the Attorney-General ' s Office of the State of Missouri that the likelihood of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 per cent higher than for whites.
“The aim is to warn people about the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People must be prepared in a way or in a way, whether they will take the money for a bet or tell their relatives what they are travelling in the territory of the state.”
According to the FBI's latest hate crimes report, there were 100 hate crimes registered in Missouri in 2015, which makes the state sixteenth of the State in view of such violations.
The prevention of movement is also a response to the new state law of Missouri, after which it will be more difficult to initiate a case against a legal person in connection with housing or employment discrimination.
The American Union for the Protection of Civil Liberties (ACLU) had previously announced warnings to travellers in Texas and Arizona after these states had adopted new immigration control laws, under which local law enforcement authorities were ordered to arrest people for violations of immigration laws, which, in the opinion of ACLU, had to increase the number of checks on racial grounds.
Movement warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recent public organizations have resorted to this in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people were killed as a result of a police patrol shot in Egypt
The unknown were shot by a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, Reuters reports with reference to the Ministry of the Interior of Egypt.
At the time of the shooting, two people, including one police officer, were killed and three were injured.
All wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, police stopped the car and two armed men were then fired by firemen.
One of the criminals was arrested, the other managed to hide.
Rustourism supports the law on the abolition of free baggage for return flights
The Head of Rusturism Oleg Safonov stated in an interview with the RBK telechannel that "positive" refers to the adoption of the law on the abolition of free luggage in non-return aircraft.
"It is necessary to create conditions in which a person with no luggage can buy cheap tickets rather than a person with a luggage," he stressed (TASS quote).
Mr. Safonov noted, however, that despite the fears of the citizens, there would be no need to pay for the carriage of the top-of-the-line clothes and mobile phones in the handcuffs.
"It would be right to calm down all our citizens and tourists and say that it's to the top of our clothes, to the zontics, to the mobile phone, to the iPad or even to some computer to have no relationship," said Rusturism's head.
Former President Vladimir Putin of Russia signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the rule on the free movement of luggage from the return aircraft.
The point is that airlines can themselves determine the number of seats and the weight of the baggage included in the non-reversible tariff.
Vladimir Putin ordered the elimination of Baikal pollution
President Vladimir Putin of Russia at the Baikala Protection Meeting reported that significant areas of the lake have been contaminated in recent years.
He had been instructed to identify sources of funding, plans and executives for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also ordered the full recovery of the contaminated territories.
“It is also necessary to deal with the facilities that continue to work here, most of them have been cleared,” quoted the President's RIA News.
He also added that the Russian Attorney General ' s Office should carry out an environmental check.
According to him, there were problems in the lake area related to the occurrence of natural debris and a number of environmental violations by recreational organizers.
"I want to emphasize this: it is not all right to check, here too the measure needs to be known, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and appropriate measures," he stressed.
In the past, the Gen procuratorate reported a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed an increase in the number of facilities under environmental supervision.
Recall that on 15 June, Vladimir Putin, during the direct line, stated the need to amend legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of the special security regime.
He was informed of the problems of business activities by the inhabitants of the island of Olhon, which is part of the Baikalic Natural Territory.
The Principality of Minority Sergei Donski has immediately proposed to address the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baykala water protection zone, but the Government of Burma has recalled that such a change is not sufficient, as restrictions are linked to a number of regulatory acts.
In Minéconomy, it had previously been proposed to address the problem by amending the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
A new temple will appear in the South
In the village of Sosova, members of the community of the indigenous small peoples of the North Rachtinja, together with the inhabitants of the Berzev region, participate in the construction of the Orthodox temple in honour of the saint Nikolai Chudovartz.
Its location is the river bank, the temple will be well seen from far away, so it will serve as a way for the fishermen.
According to community representatives, the construction work will be completed this year, now the dome has been established, with church circles available.
The Games REB of the fleet provided transport.
The temple is named after Saint Nicholas the Wizard because it is regarded as the Orthodox Church as the patron of passengers, including fishermen.
The fishing industry in Sosus provides the settlers with work, feeding them.
Local residents are waiting when the temple opens its doors, and children are even writing about it in school essays as a matter of local dignity.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why do the laws apply in Singapore?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in an open air breakfast.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, the packs contain exactly the iron box attached to him from the office.
After the interview, the businessman is sent to the nearest hour - a hundred meters - and takes the bull out there.
The penalty for bribery in the public place is $500 local, says Chang.
You know, since I was a kid, I've just had a reflex: you can't just throw a freak out of the confectionery on the bridge, you know, right now.
And now it's all over the video camera.
And indeed, Singapore's sidewalks in the center of the city are clean, as it were in the museum.
Chang relates: Three months ago, his 18-year-old son was excavating the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to death.
What?
Imagine yourself.
He had ten strikes of a wooden stick on his cattle and spent a week in prison.
We don't have a lot of body punishment.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and incredibly strict laws, the AIF observer was considered on the spot.
No one's thinking about canceling the death penalty here, explains lawyer Victor Li Hong.
Both the European Union and the United States have long held the view.
If a person carries a large amount of drugs or trades them, he has a habit.
In 2002, a 22-year-old citizen of Australia was detained at Changi Airport, with 400 g of cocaine.
The Australian Prime Minister spoke for him, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the pope of Rome.
However, the guy was still hanging.
After that, our country's drug addicts are running hard on the side.
The case is this: Singapore states that the laws are required to comply with the UNCCD in an orderly manner, not only with the poor and the poor.
No matter who you are, a millionaire, a vice-premier, a famous artist or a resident of the Euro Union.
The variant in this case is one: if you get half the cocaine, you'll be hanged.
When you're going to Singapore and you're meeting a bunch of warning dogs everywhere, you're just wondering how many bans there are in this city.
For example, the chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies and can be bought strictly by a doctor.
The tourist will not take the pick-up, but it's worth adding a "cut-off" to the subway, a fine of $1,000.
In four days, I met two people with white plates on my neck, "I fucked up."
Besides the fine, the U.S.U. is often awarded a "reference in the yard" - a week to clean up the parks and beaches.
6 thousand rub. pays a "criminal" who forgets to clean up water in the public toilet, and when attempting to meet the need for the elevator of the home, a special detector is being built - the doors are blocked and the signal is sent to the police.
Among all exotic laws are bans on the feeding of pigeons on the street, public performance of songs, and even excessive use of the room plant (!): it is considered that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
In order to avoid the fires of smokers, the lighters cannot be passed to the subway, otherwise they will be fined to 5,000 Singaporen basses.
In general, the idea is: whatever you try, you must be violating something.
It's not like that, but it's trying to convince me that Muhammad Kabir-Qajariya, the owner of the local tour agency.
In particular, fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last twenty years, I haven't seen anyone get involved in their violation.
Why are they staying?
So that the citizens don't relax.
The basic rules are closely followed.
Let's say if the minor is sold in a cigarette, they'll be punished in a chain: the store owner will pay a huge amount, the offender himself will get hits with the "back" stick, and the seller will also be appointed and put in prison.
It is because of the very strict laws of the offence in Singapore that are very rare.
Is that true?
As early as the 1970 ’ s, we had road chaos, automobiles ignoring light lights, driving like hotels, and driving drunks.
After the fines were introduced, everything calmed down a year.
Now the driver, drinking a glass of whiskey, knows: if they stop, the police will not allow for a bribe, pay a fine to the value of the apartment and leave for years.
Many foreigners in South-East Asia seem to be a variety of cities.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Dishneland with the death penalty" - the guests from the U.S. threatened the entire population's wealth, "fearing clean airport" and "ocultural nature".
The board, such things are unnatural, they look artificial, and they shouldn't be like that in principle.
The first days in Singapore, and you're really afraid to throw a paper on the sidewalk, you'll agree if it gets in the subway with the frozen.
But then you come to the Small India area, and the other is the pattern breaking: the bus stops are filled with plastic bottles.
"How's that?" You're surprised.
That's right, the Singaporeans are smiling.
It's all happening.
Not for every such crime, but you must know, if they count you, you will not be expelled, for you have violated the law.
Most of all, it's enough for a person to be normal.
Of course, Singapore's power is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnam, I moved very cautiously - motorcyclists often come out of the hands of tourists by smartphones and cameras.
In the centre of Paris, full of dirty bombs and demand.
They're not all trying to throw garbage in the urn on our streets either.
Singapore, on the other hand, has become the most peaceful, clean and safe city on earth, thanks to the collection of draconian fines and the ruthless (including the death penalty).
You're thinking.
Such a human nature: remember, and in Russia, no one has been a part of the movement until they are punished.
Although the main thing is not a fine in Singapore, it is the voluntary observance of the laws.
And we should think that people in Russia would also be happy with the clean streets, the lack of a garbage in the subway, and welcome the arrest of those who walk the elevator with a public toilet.
There's body punishment, thank you, no need.
In the rest of Singapore's laws, at least there is a need to look at them.
Nothing sacred?
Now the White House of Trump aimed at the Statue of Freedom.
The most reliable sign of the regime's change is when it starts fighting statues.
The Americans do not understand this worse than all others - from here on the stage of Saddam Hussain's statue on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologies of the Trump Government, no doubt knew what he had done when he took a symbolic emphasis on the Status of Freedom during a heated dispute with CNN journalist Jim Ostensus on the President's proposals for a dramatic reduction in legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try on his own.
The officers of the owners of the sailing ships and artists representing the Statue of Freedom would have been tempted to do so if he had tried to do so.
But he tried to make sense of it, and especially of the meaning that she was assigned in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when the text of Emma Lazarus was added to the pedestal.
As Miller pointed out to Acosta, "I don't want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Freedom is a symbol of American freedom, which is a symbol of peace.
The relief you are talking about has been added later and is not part of the original Freedom Statute."
Miller put the facts right, but as he said himself, it's really not about history.
This is about the current sound of the devastating words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the State invites not all immigrants, but the poorest: "Your dead, your poor, / your crowds dreaming to breathe freely, / The unhappy discharges of your vast shores."
"unlucky discharges" have never been seen on our screens.
Miller didn't do literature - he made it clear that these people are not waiting in America's Trump.
The issue of the meaning of the statue is part of the broader political and cultural war: it is indeed the issue of the meaning of America.
Lazarus and her friends, who fought to place her words on the statue after her death, were very well aware that they were doing a very political act.
The sculpture was designed to form a link between the French and American republics by means of the banal classic figure of the Women ' s Picture of Freedom.
Lazarus changed her mind: The woman’s figure is no longer abstract, and she has a voice.
And she's got a completely different name: Mother of the Disfellowshiped.
The combination of poetry and image was a brilliant feminist movement and a destructive attack on American nativity.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right to change it back.
The thunderous Rash Limbo, of his kind John the Baptist, who brought about the arrival of Trump in 2010, argued that Freedom does not invite anyone; rather, it is an early neoconservator carrying the fire of America in the darkness of peace: "Freedom is moving forward.
It is a facilitator of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
Fakel doesn't need to light the way to the U.S.."
Limbo's habit really got in the way.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she would have been tempted, unhappy, but full of hope on board ships after a long and often heavy voyage.
This literally means looking at the world with the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue is in response to the words of hope and hospitality that they dream of hearing.
And, of course, it's not the prospect that Miller and Trump will ever want to admit.
Their jaws need not light up the way, but burn up hatred, which is the only source of their strength.
2017 World Championship: Neil Blake commends Scottish members of the United Kingdom Assembly.
Elid Doyle remembers the time when there were only two Scottishs in the United Kingdom.
Neil Blake, the director of the Federation's games with the light athletes of the United Kingdom, said that a 16-person Scottish party to the World Championship would make a "significant contribution to the team's game".
The record number of Scottish light athletes was selected for the 2017 London Championship starting on Friday.
Blake believes that in Scotland “something special is born” and the Federation should take this into account by the light athletes of the United Kingdom.
"We know that and we're trying to understand and support as long as they have the potential," Blake said.
"I spoke to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it's about what they did.
The Scottish Federation of Light Athletics thinks that what they did should work.
The British Federation of Light Athletics: what they did must work.
And people on the street think the same thing.
I don't know why things have happened that way, but it's so brighter."
Some of the Scottish light athletes claim medals, including Laura Moore and Andrew Bachert, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at 5,000 metres; and Elid Doyle has chosen his captain.
"Alid is modest.
Her Captain's speech was wonderful," Blake says.
"Many light athletes, regardless of whether they are or not, and where they live or are trained, have left this room feeling proud and eager to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Elid had put in her were remarkable."
The owner of the Silver Medal of the Commonwealth Championship, which, on its fifth World Championship, runs 400 m away with obstacles, says that 16 Scottishs in the British assembly are "incredibly".
The previous record of the number of Scottishs at the World Championship was equal to seven in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Muhr, who has been in the middle of the race and has had five and two European records last year.
She's going to run 1500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Her, who will take part in the 1500 m strike, is another Scottish man who has to pay attention to: behind him is a successful season in which there have been victories at the British competitions and annual competitions.
Doyle remembers his first world championship, when besides her, the only Scottish team in the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says she's "incredibly proud" of the fact that so many of her fellow citizens have not only entered the assembly, but in some cases they will claim medals and fight for the final.
"The captain of the team elects other members of the team, so it was a great honor in any case, but knowing that your friends voted for you and chose you -- it's a very special thing to me," she added.
"Finally, I'm very proud of all the Scottish people who went into the gathering.
This shows how much we have accomplished.
And they're all holding the light-airs, trying to get to the pedesters.
What about my Captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was okay.
I just drew attention to the fact that we were very happy to take the World Cup home.
So it's just about how it's important to get support from the sick and take advantage of what we're going to do at the Olympic Stadium again.
I've got another chance to go to his arena and participate in the competitions, and the atmosphere will be just amazing."
Blocking criticisms on Facebook: You don't have to go public unless you're ready to hear criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood that such a critical press was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but this did not prevent them from criticizing him for everything from domestic policy to his political principles.
The criticism of him, of course, upset him.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said: "It is possible to take away the freedom of speech and us, the deaf and the lame, will walk like sheep to the battle."
Now I'm going to go to Governor Maryland Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
The Hogans have blocked and killed at least 450 people who have expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Union for the Protection of Civil Liberties has put him in court for this.
The subordinate governors called this claim nothing, and the commentary on the internet was written in a spirit of "well and what".
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But that's also important.
And that's especially important when it comes to Hogan's guy.
He is an amazingly popular Republican governor in the democratic favour of the state.
He is second in the country's 50 governors' approval rating.
Hogan's not a stubborn reaction.
He demonstrated a firm hand in government and commitment to his principles.
He also uses Facebook as the primary means of communicating with his voters and with jokes shows on his page his lips after head chemotherapy.
Therefore, to block people who come to the Governor's page, which is declared as an official public forum and is conducted by the administration for taxpayers' money, is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In the Washington Post interview, Press Secretary Amelia Ches defended the Governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments was simply their moderation.
But it's too easy to use the images of trolleys, spamers and hackers that are evil on the Internet.
"Post" spoke to some of the real people who blocked Hogan.
And these are real people, not trolls, teachers, businessmen, pastors who turn to their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, meaningful and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible by appealing to Hogan as a Catholic.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Raman of Bowi, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about crimes on the ground of hatred.
"I have written a strong comment that I am disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the commentary section on the post article.
"I also don't like the idea that when many people leave comments on the same subject, some immediately say it's a so-called riot instead of admitting that they have a lot of people who are unhappy."
What subordinate governors call "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call "an active living position".
In Facebook's era, it's easy to edit your image simply by blocking criticism or making negative comments.
It's much less dusty work than before when it was necessary to send people, collect and burn newspapers with critical propellers or arrest and mouth-to-mouth protests.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just in the numerator.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other neighbors.
President Trampu has been sued by Twitter users who have been imprisoned in his Twitter account.
One of the first, reverse decisions on this topic was taken this week in Virginia.
According to a U.S. district judge from Alexandria, James K. Cashheris, the chairman of the county council of the county of Laudon violated the First Amendment, including the voter in his Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bevin made claims to the American Union to protect civil liberties for his behaviour on Facebook and Twitter.
It's not that hard.
In Washington, D.C., the cost of mail was about the same as today's Internet.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers increased fourfold, and authors of anonymous letters greatly violated its authority.
And even then Washington was dealing with anonymous controls.
People under the alias "Uricola", "Valerius", "Belzarius" and "Porcius" wrote letters in the newspaper that mocked Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected from the George Washington Papers online, his office was seized by petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation.
But he didn't try to keep them quiet.
Freedom of speech, inconsistencies and statements is the very basis of our State.
And true leadership means agreement.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home facilities at the Renaissance Club
The former European champion, Ronan Rafferti, is looking forward to home comforts for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Latvia will host the twenty-fifth open-ended Scottish golf tournament for older athletes.
The native of Northern Ireland, who was leading a nearby Archerfield Links club, moved to the final round last year until he lost Paul Ilsa, joined the new place and played the role of a tour representative on behalf of the founder and director of the Jerry Saravadi club.
“I saw the Renaissance club built, and we see how it is successful with this event,” said Rafferty.
“The players will see this field at its best moment, it is in a magnificent state.
Jerry's done a great job of setting this place up.
He's angry with the commitment of this game and proud of his achievements here.
This is a great demonstration for this field."
English Ills is looking forward to the opportunity to stand for the championship for the first time, despite the fact that he won his 32-year career in the European Tour and in the European Challenge Tour.
"It's really a special feeling," said a player from Southport.
“I was unable to try to win “Extremadura Open” again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
Returning to this corner of peace is magical.
It's a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories are coming back, and for me and my wife, Sharon, it was a very special impression to win last year.
It was truly a special time, and we will always remember him."
Returns to the struggle of Gary Orr, who joined the European Tournament for the elderly after his 50th birthday this year.
This event will be the first public event in Scotland in 2013 at the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
"When you play at home, it's always more important," said the resident of Helensboro Orr.
"You want to do well, but you feel this extra burden."
I was very happy to play again, and I showed a bad golf course.
I'm happy with how much I've still got."
The three will be joined by the former winner of the Masters tournament Ien Wusnem and the champions for the old athletes Paul Brodherst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Captain Ryder Cup Sam Torrence is two of the six Scottish people on the field; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Steven Macalister, Bill Longmuier and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free of charge, and the park costs 5 pounds an hour if one person is in the car, and 10 pounds if the person is two or more.
All revenues go to the British Prostate Cancer Fund.
British Roads to Overcome Harmful Emissions
Similar tunnels on highways capable of absorbing carbon dioxide emitted by cars are already being tested on the streets of Britain.
The country ' s transport agency, according to Autocar, reported positive results of the 100-metre tunnel tests established on one of the sixes in the north of the country.
The 6-metre tunnel is built from some of the latest polymer materials that can absorb harmful substances contained in road outlets.
However, the establishment of a network of such tunnels is only part of the vast measure that the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel networks, English are going to expand the charging station network for electric cars, implement a number of road traffic reduction activities, increase the use of commercial transport on the electricity line, and modernize heavy-duty truck parks.
According to official statistics, four of all air pollutants are transportable, and the unsatisfying quality of air is the cause of up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgorsud changed the punishment of the disabled Mamaevu to a fine
Mosgorsud changed the punishment of invalid Anton Mamayov, sentenced to four and a half years in a colony, to a fine of 200 thousand.
That's what TACS reports.
Earlier, the Prosecutor's Office asked the court to replace the term for parole by explaining its request that Mamaeva's disease "in prison conditions prevent him from being found".
The 28-year-old Anton Mamayev was sentenced to four and a half years in prison with the execution of a sentence in the general regime for the murder of which he was the ex-fiancist.
On 19 July, the Court of Justice, at a meeting in the CISO, released the man from custody.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian “Golden Land”
Ready lunch, Bardina Degei doesn't use the plate.
She doesn't even use it in a bad way.
In his wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Pania County, in the Indonesian province of Papua, the housekeeper usually carries a sweet potato, which is called a note, right in front of the eye.
After half an hour, the beads reach and eat with unscrupulous, unwashed hands.
Degei is sitting on the ground floor – she has no furniture – and this is where she does her homework at home, like a strip of dirty water from a nearby mud.
The air is served in the room without a roof.
She was the youngest of four wives to her husband, so she was not assigned to work in the field.
Multiplicity here is widespread.
Of course, working late may be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many are drunk, and there are still soldiers.
"No one decides to go through the village after five dinners," she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at daily life in the high mountain of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which had joined Indonesia in 1969 after a questionable referendum, when only 1026 elders had to vote publicly before the occupying forces.
The current movement of independence from the Netherlands has quickly turned its anger against the Government of Jakarta, which maintains strict control over the region without allowing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua and the independent State of Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enorthalia is a city as far away as abandoned; the road here includes a half-hour drive from Jaapura, the administrative center of the province, in Nabira, and then a five-hour drive to the hire car.
There's no public transport here.
The city with a population of about 19,000 is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; the roofs are decorated with rust in various reddish shades.
Few of the Indonesians came here, no longer talking about journalists, and almost none of the foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the popes worshipped a god named Ugh Tamea.
There have been other changes.
“It was unusual for us to wear this dress,” says Degei, showing his bright, hundreds of hand turbans, dark yuba and a bright shirt.
“We used to wear only sheets.”
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, 28 per cent of its population lives in poverty, while children's mortality and literacy are among the worst in Asia.
But it's still Indonesian gold.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, belonging to the Phoenix Freeport McMoran company, is located in just 60 miles from Pania, a high-rise province with approximately 153,000 people living in New Jersey.
Only in 2015 did Freeport acquire gold and media here for about $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua can be welcomed by stocks of forests valued at $78 billion.
These riches, however, bring one misfortune to the popes, guaranteeing that the powerful Indonesian armed forces remain here in awe.
According to a New York Times survey in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local soldiers and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands for greater autonomy by the popes are threatening the existence of this gold house and are unforgivably suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, more than 500,000 popes have been killed by the Indonesian military since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and deprived of liberty.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killings in the indigenous peoples of the high mountains of Papua can be considered genocide in the 1970s.
Only last year did the Indonesian police arrest over 3,900 peaceful protestors in the region.
“We are losing everything”, a report published in 2016 by the Brisbane Fair contains testimony of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as fines without a court, torture – especially parts, as claimed in another report, rape and defeat by electric current – and the cruel repression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims because accidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harrisono, who is studying in Indonesia for the Human Rights Watch.
The Haitians have been delayed because the resources of Papua New Guinea have attracted the influx of displaced people from other parts of Indonesia.
The 3.5 million population of the province is 83 per cent of Christians, but population rates change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulavesi.
Javan lovers, varungi, sell a hot chicken and a mixture of gado-gado vegetables, which is supplied with peanut sauce.
Locals are trying to maintain competition.
“The migrants began selling chicken and vegetables cheaply on the traditional market than the indigenous people of Papua,” explains Abbot Jou, a 20-year-old native of Pania, moving to Jaapur, the administrative centre of the province, for work.
“Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua – the mother of Papua (Women) – lost their market.”
The president of Indonesia, Joco Vidodo, known in the people as Jokovi, vowed to deal with inequality and violations of the rights of Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former fleet was supported by 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Pania.
But there's almost nothing changed in Papua, and the locals feel loyal.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokova, waiting for him to meet our hopes for a restoration of justice," Jou said.
In fact, only two months after the October inauguration of Jocove Pania survived the tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street and sang Christmas hymns in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers were thrown out of the darkness on motorcycles.
Fearful children told them that they should include the lights.
As local pastor Javed Tebay reported, one of the soldiers struck their tone and came back with four soldiers for a while.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, soldiers who were drunk, chased children and were examples of gunshots.
Then one of the soldiers shot the children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julianus Amy, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a nearby government building of the electoral commission, and the situation accelerated the next day.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered at the football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They brought with them the ritual hunters of the bow and filled the wind, the dance of the Pago Pago tribe — running around and depicting the bird’s pen.
Some Protestants began to turn stones into police and military bases.
When the situation began, internal radio forces were ordered: “If the crowd is going to resist more than three times, shoot them,” he said, as stated in the official paper that saw the correspondents of the TIME magazine, but which was not published in local media.
Fifty - six - year - old Jeremias Kayame, head of Quego Coto region in Enarotali, felt a sense of danger and called for peace, asking the crowd to come to their homes.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I came back, I suddenly got a bullet in my left wrist,” he told the magazine TIME, standing on the wing of his brightly decorated wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot, but he says the bullet flew by the soldiers gathered.
"There was a crowd, there was a lot of shooting," he adds.
In the local village of Alfius Joua, he fell three times, as his twin brother, who witnessed the shooting, told him.
“I ran to him and looked at his body to make sure he was there,” said the magazine “Timee” Johannes, which, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
General Yotje Mende, Chief Inspector of the Papuan Police, told reporters that his officers were only "protecting" their base because it was under attack.
"We must protect ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Commissioner Pujo Sulistio, police representative of Papua New Guinea in 2015.
“This is the question of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young Protestants were killed and much more wounded.
News of the murders reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jacobi spoke in Jaapura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and swearing to address the historical abuses of power in Papua.
"I want this situation to be solved immediately so that it will never be repeated again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security, Viranto, said that he would establish an indictable organization to put an end to the historical violations of human rights.
But we almost got the answers right away.
“Most of the violations have occurred a long time ago.
Some of them were in the nineties or at the beginning of the zeros.
It is a matter of course that we want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be followed," he said.
Viranto then refused to speak with the magazine “Time” on 5 June in Jakarta, and said that he did not plan to establish an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Rather, he said, ‘All things will be decided by a judgement.’
Viranto, who was accused of “crime against humanity” by the United Nations in connection with the death of more than 1,000 people during the bloody vote on East Timor’s independence in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been committed in Papua, including an incident in Panama.
The families of the victims from Pania met with such statements with a dark distrust.
“For the last three years, I have been questioned four times, but there has been no change,” says Johannes.
"I'm tired."
He says years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid the soldiers will arrest me, I'm afraid they'll shoot me."
His brother James also expressed the view that the inhabitants of Pania were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by soldiers after he helped to bury four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the soldiers came after me," he says.
Shooting's not over.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighborhood of Pania District Deiya.
During the clash between the forest residents and the construction company manager, who refused to help a man who was unconscious, in the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
A man, twenty-four-year-old Ravenus Doww, who drowned while fishing in a drifting river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested at the construction site office of the company.
According to the police, the villagers were throwing stones at officers who had responded to the warning shots.
But the locals claim that the mobile brigade (indonesian witch) started shooting at the crowd and killed one man.
“We were in such a panic, we were afraid of revenge,” he reported to the twenty-nine-year-old Domingg Badia, who lived near the hospital and saw them deliver the wounded.
"I hid at home for two days."
Parliament demanded that the officers involved in the incident be called upon to respond and that the mobile police brigade be withdrawn from the region.
Pania has always been a painful place for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of significant development is due to the dissatisfaction of the tribes of mine, monkeys, data and dams scattered throughout the territory covered by the greenery of the central high mountains of Papua.
Many joined the Movement for the Free Papua (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of the popes by establishing a radical attack and inflaming with the kidnapping of the people of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of OPM come from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Cogoya.
As a response in recent years, thousands of people have been arrested and disproportionately detained by the military under the pretext of “protection of national independence”.
Some didn't come back.
Among the people of Papua Pania is considered a “poor, forgotten place”.
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
The small proportion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
The same kind of bread is not available.
People here grow everything they eat: mostly notes, as well as some fruits and leaves.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can take four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, and the rest are sold locally.
Ten club notes are made up of 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequality between indigenous popuas and new migrants has increased, following the introduction of new aircraft at Nabire Airport.
Few existing vacancies are usually provided to more educated and sustainable migrants.
Popes rarely have the money or the skills needed to run their own competitive business.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there is neither work nor money here," says John Gobai, president of the Pania National Council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
Moreover, restrictions on the work of international media remain harsh.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Eskudi and Basil Lonshan were deported from Papua for “adequate coherence with relevant organizations” despite having been granted rare videoconferencing permits.
According to Felima China, the Asia Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises made during the pre-election campaign of Jokova to remove media restrictions in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
“Now foreign journalists trying to keep reports from the neighbouring eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua are facing new dangers: refusal of a visa and entry into a black list,” he said in a statement.
The lack of press attention means that the international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited by the direct neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States -- Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands -- requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “diversity and widespread violations” in Papua New Guinea, including shooting in Panama.
The same countries in the past supported OPM.
The representative of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Armanata Nasir withdrew from the group statement, informing reporters in Jakarta that “In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide the evidence of episodes of human rights violations”.
Locals want more foreign Governments to focus on the situation.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Dutch human rights ambassador, Keiss Van Baaram, visited Jaipur on 4 May, locals violated the silence, saying, “We want freedom”, as the source also claimed to be present at the meeting, but wished to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, new presidential elections will take place in 2019, but the popes say that they will hardly vote again for Jokova.
“Jokovi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in shooting in Pania,” says Gobai, president of the tribal council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the people of Pania, in addition to the fact that they live in the shadow of the threat by the greedy army, are in poverty, and that education and health are in a pitiful state.
Gobai says that the people of Pania, as well as other popes, consider their vote to be a debt that must be paid to Jacob.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in Pania have carried out the last symbolic act of innocence: they have buried one of the victims on the ground against the police and the military.
Knowing that justice is probably never realized, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
"They killed a member of our family," says James, not raising his head.
"What else did we have to do?"
A second fire covers the Dubai Neboscrebhn "Fakel"
The fire caught up with one of the world's tallest skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to quickly leave the 70-year-old construction at 337 metres high.
This is the second fire that has been in the upper building, which is called Fakel, by coincidence, in two years.
The building had been evacuated, the victims had not been reported, and there was no operational news about the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woke up from the fire alarm and screams of people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor," Reuters reported to a non-scrupulous person named George.
According to the Dubai City Civil Defence Administration, fires fired fire at approximately 4:00 a.m. local time (00:00 a.m. on Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working on the provision of asylum to victims.
The event can return to the agenda the security issues of materials used in the exterior of high buildings around the world.
During the investigation by the Fakela Administration after the fire, it was found that the most affected was the poster – external panels used to form and isolate.
In the United Kingdom, the police stated that they believed that the isolation system and the planks of the Granfell Tower building in London could speed up the spread of the fire that took place there in June, resulting in the deaths of some 80 people.
The growth of the tourist stream in Ida Virumaa in June has been minimal
According to the data received by the correspondent of the Rus.err.ee portal in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017, hotel services in North-East were used in a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists, with 125 people or 0.6 per cent more than in the same period earlier.
The number of local tourists has decreased, and the number of foreigners has grown.
In June, the outflow increased by 7.3 per cent (544 people) to 7994 tourists.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2 per cent from 12,944 to 12,525.
The number of Russian tourists in the region increased by 8.9 per cent or 318 compared to June 2016.
In June 2017, 3885 guests from the RF stayed at Ida Virumaa hotels.
Andrei Malahov gave the idea to worshipers who are guilty of his care
Andrei Malahov has forced his worshipers to Instagram, who are guilty of his departure from the First Channel.
So far, he has not commented on any of the hearings, but today he has placed a fragment of the newspaper "Advertising" on 1 August.
The photo of Malahov has signed the "boss milkcoss."
An article on how to prevent and address the worker ' s "outbreak " .
If you recall a number of reports that the leader was unable to find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who was able to reform “Let’s Speak”, it becomes clear what he has so clearly intruded, writes “CP”.
It was reported that Andrei Malahov was currently on vacation and did not sign a statement of dismissal from the First Channel.
The situation of dismissal can be clarified in the next few days.
Five soldiers were killed in an explosion in Afghanistan
At least five soldiers were killed in an explosion in the province of Gilmand in Afghanistan, reports the RIA News.
According to the police, an abandoned car was blown up by the military station in Girishk before evening.
It's about 20 dead.
On Friday morning in Girishke, a new CP occurred.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
Reshoot between attackers and security forces continues.
Diver took a video of the shark trying his camera.
Diver and researcher Greg Scomal sealed on a video shark that tried his ex-camera GoPro.
Rólik posted on Facebook the US Maritime Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, whose staff is Scomal.
The incident occurred on 2 August at the Cape-Cod peninsula shores in the north-east of the United States, detailing the Necn portal.
The man tried to remove the shark from the camera, which he held on a special bat.
When a man noticed that the animal was more than three feet [3 m] long, he sank to it.
The shark had agreed to bite the camera, but it did not try to attack the scientist.
Scomal explained that the thief did so in order to determine whether the boyfriend was compatible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that such behavior of the marine animal was for scientists in the news.
A known cause of the mass battle at the Ural Military Center
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District to investigate the circumstances of the incident came to the Elan Training Centre, where a massive dragon occurred.
Some details of this plague have already become known.
According to the Mash public, on the "Vkontakte" page, the contractants of the Ural military section number 31612 were severely injured because of uninhabited beds.
It all started with the fact that a series on behalf of Sayan had been demonstrably ignored by the officer ' s order to inflict a beating on the plaintiff.
The officer's men of the sixth year stood on the side of the officer.
Saina supported the first mouth.
At about 140 young men were smashed into a bed and closet, and glass was taken out.
More than ten people were killed in the mass battle.
In the CWC, the information on footing was rejected.
The study showed that at least one fifth of the passengers in the United States are carrying prohibited items on an aircraft.
The study showed that more than 20 per cent of aircraft passengers had deliberately or accidentally carried on board the aircraft through the U.S. Transport Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 per cent had been installed in the aircraft, without having any prohibited knives or other sharps.
Almost 1 per cent reported that they later discovered that they had accidentally had firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., and involving more than 1,000 people, also showed that young passengers are more inclined to violate the rules.
Of the respondents who acknowledged that they were consciously trying to fly from something forbidden to ATB, 19.7 per cent were millionaires compared to less than 15 per cent of the X-generation.
ATA staff are consciously fed and watered most of the time.
More than 3 per cent were recognized as having undergone a special examination of sharp objects, and 2.2 per cent of respondents and 3.7 per cent of respondents had recognized that they had deliberately carried prohibited medications into the aircraft.
The company stated that it had studied passengers throughout the country to find out how many of them had accidentally smuggled through airport inspection and how well they had done it.
We expect the most - conscious or unconscious - smuggling by checking those who fly the most.
As the company points out, the ATB rules are rather complex and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what fluids they can carry and how much.
It is not surprising, therefore, that most of what the ATB chooses is forbidden fluids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATB could consider books prohibited.
Liquids are permitted on domestic voyages, but not on international voyages.
EPA Pruitt's head rejects the intention to postpone the implementation of the emission reduction rules adopted by Obama
The next day, following the request of 15 States, the head of the Environment Agency withdrew his decision to postpone the implementation of the rules adopted by Obama to reduce emissions of air pollutants and power-generating substances.
The Pruitt explained its decision that its agency was now more than in previous administrations to the needs of environmental regulators of individual states.
He did not mention an appeal against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The campaign was launched around 1 October, to which states were required to comply with the 2015 Earth-level ozone standards.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone their compliance for one year to give his department more time to study the plan and to avoid “incompatibilities to local decisions or obstacles to economic growth”.
Pruitt, which had long been known as a consistent opponent of the strengthening of environmental norms before President Trampov was appointed as the Attorney General of Oklahoma.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or postponed the introduction of regulations that were opposed by the chemical or gas-oil industry.
The unexpected change in the course on the Wednesday was the regular legal defeat of the course taken by the Poett to return to the previous rules.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the head of EPA had exceeded its mandate in order to postpone the implementation by Obama of a rule that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakages.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that, following a sharp change in the course of the ozone standards, he was simply obliged to cooperate with the states in an integrated process of timely implementation of the new standards.
“EPA’s previous administrations often could not be placed within the deadlines set, then expected demands from groups of activists and others and discussed the deadlines during the settlement of the case”, Pruitt said, who filed more than a dozen claims against EPA at his previous post.
"We do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings, and we are serious about the deadlines set.
We are also serious about our constitution and the authority that he gives us."
However, the EPA statement said that the Pruitt might at some point re-use its “powers to defer and other powers given by law” to ensure that the rules “jcyjdfys in a clear and accessible manner”.
The Republicans of Congress insist on a broader revision of the ozone regulations.
A bill approved by the House of Representatives last month seeks to postpone implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this matter.
The Attorney General of New York, Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that filed a complaint against the EPA this week, said that the group was planning to continue its legal pressure.
"The change in the EPA course - following our demands - is an important victory in the fight against health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the power to cover their cities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as Colombia.
The ground-level ozone occurs when conventional pollutants from machinery, power plants, petroleum and chemical plants and other sources enter the atmosphere in sunlight.
The triggering of this can cause serious breathing problems in people who are sensitive to it, leading to thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health defenders and environmental defenders welcomed the unexpected change in the Pruitt course.
"It's a shame to think about how much pressure it took to achieve this perfectly logical step from a person to protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Trump administration and the protection of those who pollute the air and their special interests."
The IAAF Congress extended the removal of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics
The Congress of the International Association of Light-Athletic Federations (IAAF) voted in favour of the extension of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics (WFLA).
The Congress therefore supported the IAAF Council for the Recovery of WFLA, which issued a report Monday, in which it recommended that the withdrawal be allowed.
For the extension of the removal, 166 persons voted against 21 against the TASS.
The report of the IAAF Board said that WFLA had made significant progress in achieving the terms set out by the Council for the Restoration of Membership, but these conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of WFLA at the London World Championship, Russian light athletes were forced to act under a neutral flag.
There were 19 persons admitted to the IAAF team.
WFLA was subject to an indefinite disqualification by the IAF in 2015.
At that time, the report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Fraud Agency (WADA) Dick Pounda was published, which dealt with numerous violations of the WADA regulation, accepted by Russian officials and sportsmen.
For more details on the last report of the IAAF Board, read "U" "IAAF has extended sanctions against WFLA".
Offensive defeat
As part of the 3rd tour of the Russian Fonbeth-PfL team, the New-Mossian "Chimik" was taking a stand against the Kaluga FC.
More than 10 days ago, rivals played together in a Russian cube, but this time the game was completely different.
The chemical has nothing to do with the opponent, but the second relaxation on the base of the match has led to the insulting goal and fiasco.
After the recent defeat of the Collegiates with a 0:3 account, many had previously foretold a slight victory of the owners.
However, from the start of the meeting, the New Yorkers have been forced to consider themselves and act against the defence, but from a position of strength.
In the 1st time, the turkeys were more developed and benefited from the control of the ball.
A very high quality match was conducted by Alexie Sirotin, who had repeatedly experienced dangerous hits and given confidence to his partners by his actions.
Regrettably, in the chemical attack, there was no effort and no connection to put the Kalugi defense in a dump and kill the first target on the way out.
After the game was interrupted, it began to take place in meeting courses.
The Novomoscians were more active in the attack.
The alarming bells for our team have become defensive errors that have allowed the students to create a number of sharp moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the chemical meeting, he took over the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experiences of the students played their part - they were more literally and coldly finished, spending their time taking the doors.
After the dangerous attack, the chemical was transferred to the corner, whose owner's field was turned into a door without resistance.
The author of the goal was Yury Dubrovin.
At the chemical report meeting, he showed a good game, but suffered a humiliating defeat.
Our team is looking forward to another tour - 11 August at 19 hours in Moscow at the Torpedo Stadium called Eduardo Strzellzov's New Yorkers will meet with the favorite "Centr" FK "Ararat" group, composed of Roman Pavlukenko, Marat Izmailov, Igori Lebedenko, Alexie Rebko.
Come back to support "Chemick!"
Location and time of the meeting of the New Yorkers - 18.30 a.m. next to Magnolia (East, D.2, corp.
Chemical composition: Sirotin, Manochin (k), Romance, Shayunov, Homutov, Gogia (Oreskin), Dudatit, Rizov, Saints, Belanin (Adoevs), Andreichenko (Ligin)

According to published phone conversations, Trump pressed Mexico on the fee of the wall at the border
The Washington Post published a phone-decrypted conversation between the president of the United States of America, Donald Trump, and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, during a telephone conversation with Mexico President Enrique Peñay Njetya Trump, he insisted that he stop publicly claiming that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The president of the United States complained that he was publicly speaking against the wall and said, according to the information, “You cannot say this press.”
Trump began his pre-election campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and swore that he would make Mexico pay for the project.
His first telephone conversation with Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Ternbull, also published, also revealed a hot redundancy.
Trump told Ternbull that the agreement that the United States should accept refugees sent to Australia was “Laughter”, “rejective” and “tupoe”, and insisted that because of the agreement concluded by Obama's administration, he would look like an idiot, as he intended to stop moving refugees to the United States.
Trump finished the conversation, he said to Ternbull that “it was the most unpleasant conversation of all day.”
The bodies of the dead in Abkhazia sent the tourists on a plane from Sochi to Petersburg
A plane belonging to Russia, which is on board the bodies of the Russians who have died in Abkhazia, flew from Sochi in St. Petersburg at 20:15, in Moscow.
At the end of the survey, the board will meet with the staff of the ritual agency, as well as with the city mayors, and told reporters the Deputy Minister for Curtains and Tourism of Abkhazia, Astamir Ahba.
In the past, representatives of the Republic of PMS stated that all costs related to the return of the body to Russia had been borne by the Abkhazia Government.
In addition, the official Suhum intends to pay compensation to the families of the deceased in the amount of 500 thousand rubles.
According to Ahba, the Abkhazia leadership was willing to pay relatives who had been killed as a result of the explosions of travel and residence in the Republic, but the family only sent confidence in the right to the local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On 2 August, at around 16:20 in Moscow, two explosions began to detonate large-caliber shells and other munitions in Primordsky Gudaut, the Ministry of Defence.
As a result, the storage space has been burned, which has caused uncontrolled explosions of shells of different modifications.
As a result, two Russian citizens - Elena Polakowa - were killed in 1970 and Elena Timofheeva in 1962, who were on vacation near a sero-indigenous source.
64 persons, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 Abkhazia, were brought to the medical institutions of the Republic with various injuries.
At present, there are seven people in the station, the others are registered.
A study of the Russian influence on the American elections is taking on a large jury
The Special Prosecutor for Russia Robert Muller convened a large jury in Washington, D.C., to study Russia's influence on the election of the President of the United States in 2016, reports The Wall Street Journal and the Reuters Agency.
The majority of the jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The collected material will be examined by the Special Prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient to be charged.
Assembling a large jury, the Müller has additional authority to collect witnesses.
One of these investigations by the jury, which began a few weeks ago, will be the details of the son's meeting with Russian jurist Natalie Veselnik, then still a candidate in President Donald Trump.
To verify the details of this meeting, held in June 2016, he promised to do so himself.
They've already been studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, Donald Trump was reported to have expanded the status of his lawyers.
The Trump-younger had earlier said that he was expecting a compromise at the head of a candidate from the Hillary Clinton Demoparty, but no disclosing documents had been presented, and that was the result of the adoption.
At the beginning of August, a number of media reported that the Trampa Younger's statement about a meeting with the Vestelnik had been literally addressed to the old Trampo.
In the White House, it was explained that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, which any father would do.
Deputy Mayor Pensa was detained at work.
The deputy head of the Penz Irina Shirshin administration is detained for 48 hours under the mandate of the Investigation Committee at its workplace, reports the RIA News.
Official communications from the law enforcement authorities have not yet been received, but the press service of the SSC assured them that they will soon follow up.
There's no comment on what's going on in Penza's Mary.
Irina Chirshin is one of five deputy heads of the Penz administration.
She has been smoking urban issues and land relations since April 2015.
She had worked for a long time as head of the Gosjilstørtehn Inspectorate of the Penzen Region.
Irina Chirshin has raised three minor children, and she has repeatedly become a mother a year ago, has given up her retirement and has returned to work.
Of course, there's no spacecraft or rockets in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the establishment of Jury Gagarin's bust is a tribute to the first person in space.
Unlike the memories of the Soviet period, which are carried in some countries, the memories of Gagarin, on the contrary, are “walking on the planet”.
In 2012, the monument was established in Houston, U.S.A., near the former NASA headquarters.
In London, a memory on the territory of the Royal Observatory was set in honour of the 50th flight to space.
There is a memory of Gagarin in Germany in the town of Erfut, where our cosmonaut lived in 1963.
The memory in Karlovowe Varach (Czech Republic) escaped a public protest in 1992 and was transferred from the city centre to the area before the local airport.
A 70-year-old Gagarina appeared in Riga as a memorial of Yurius Gagarins.
So the name and surname of the first cosmonaut sound more Latvian, and it looks like he's 70 years old.
Mors Ford's murder: Activists lose Linch's courts on the scene to call for justice
"Ford Mercuri" in 1948 passed past the viewers in the village of Monroe in the state of Georgia, and with a look at the small bridge of Morse Ford.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver drove to the bridge, a group of white men with roses crossed her path.
The main man in the middle of the suit in the thin coat was hanging a cigarette and looking through the windshield.
Sitting inside was scared.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" cried the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
The damp coals broke the silence when the young black man was pushed out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which took place on 22 July, was just a stage.
But when Roger's neck was rubbed, almost all the audiences and they really were breathing.
Since 2005, activists have returned to the Mors Ford Bridge to play again that night when two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey, were chained in 1946.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It is obvious that no one has been arrested for all these years - even though we see them near us; though we know who they are," says Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the order.
"It's five in our history and it's a rock in our souls."
A 71-year-old Brooks, former member of the Georgia Congress, who has been fighting for human rights for his entire life.
For him, the show is a dramatic appeal for action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has not been corrected.
"We want investigations, we want completion, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he says.
"We can't go to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
The coroner covers the plain body of one of Mors Ford's lynching victims on July 27, 1946.
According to information received by the FBI, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of being involved in lynching.
But no one was charged with this.
Although the decades were beyond doubt, human rights defenders say that the city has always been well - known for two related reasons: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court's ruling for the first time allowed black citizens to vote for the premieres to be held that summer.
For example, during the same elections, according to the FBI, black user Roger Malcolm hit the dragon with the knife of Barnett Hester, a white landowner - apparently because of women.
Brooks says that Hester slept with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the child she had to be born was not of a husband.
According to the FBI, on 25 July 1946 Loy Harrison, the great white landowner, paid $600 to release Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins, May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they left the prison and went to the Morse Ford Bridge, a crowd of linguists surrounded the car.
"It is clear that he has organized and ordered the killings of Harrison," this conclusion is made in one of the FBI reports.
"It is also evident that there has been a conflict between state and city law enforcement authorities, who not only participated in the killings but also destroyed the evidence and hid the witnesses' identity."
Brooks calls it a step.
"It was an attempt on electoral rights," he says.
"They were all killed to send a black signal to the city: if you register and vote, it will be the same with you."
For almost ten years, Cassandra Green has been running an annual show that has been playing the tapestry at the Mors Ford Bridge.
Her performance is monitored, it captures the viewer and refers to the deep racism which, as many would think, is no longer in America.
It's hard to look at and turn around, but Green thinks it's the main thing.
"We don't want to talk about Linch's courts because they show us our own birthday," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't hear me or hear what I've been through."
This year’s show shows began in June, and on the first day of almost 30 white actors, the rest of the black people, gathered in the room and listened to the play review.
Wade Marbo was a director with Green.
He played the lead member of the clan for several years, but he said that the role had not become easier.
"I don't think I'm mad because it's not the man I am," says Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to come back at the time."
In the room of actress Darryus Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The spectacle begins with Malcolm, when he cries and pushes his wife, Hester sleeps with Dorothy.
"I said, scissors, get out of my house!"
He screams Rascon in response.
There's a blow going on.
And at the same time, all (at least, all black actors) are chochocho.
Green laughs louder than everyone else.
"What's that?" Asks Ascona.
He's worried and upset.
Am I playing again?
"No," says Green through a laugh.
"I just don't think the whites said 'negga' at the time."
"Yes," he laughs at one of the black performers.
"You have to say 'r'."
Also, energy changes in the room: discomfort changes in the sense of society.
All must do the right thing, not only for the play, but also for the memory of the four killed.
The scene begins first.
This time, when Rascona says the word "n", it gets clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
The show ends in a harsh and fast way.
Screams, shoots, and then shut up.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands over the bodies of the actors and plays a sad song by Billy Holliday "Strong Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by a word.
In a hundred yards of it, hundreds of viewers are tearing out tears and sweat.
Among the audiences is almost the same number of black and whites.
One couple came from Itaki, New York, to see the presentation; many live nearby.
They had been suffering for almost eight hours for the heavy spirit of Georgia while Brooks led them to the morgues of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until now, the murder has only remained history, but now that they're standing in the same place where people were being drawn, their ghosts seem to be in the air here.
When the last note of the song is silenced, Green invites people to come closer and look at the bodies.
The children are drawn to their heads, attached to the beauty of the blood, and the bodies of the dead, and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," said one little boy, as if to remind himself of it.
A few minutes later Green thanks the audience, and it's over.
Actors remove ropes from their necks and remove tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbo, the man in the suit who played the main doll.
Nick Ruscona embraces two other actors, and he weeps, falls into their arms: the emotional load of the show finally fell on him.
"All right," whispers one of the women.
"We know that your heart is good.
You had a reason for this."
Later, spectators will have dinner with actors.
On one table, a white couple from Atlanta are livelyly discussing a show with a black couple they just met.
Denise Dapplinski is hard to find words to describe how she feels after the show.
"It's hard to hear these horrible, ugly words and actions... people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think the tapes are still going on," she adds, "it's just now called that the police are shooting."
In the other corner, Tyron Brooks took the lead in the room, which is remembered for his work as a human rights defender.
He said that he had already begun planning a presentation next year.
"The stop is encouraging to us because it not only describes not only the horror of what we have survived, but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history and who do not know their own history are doomed to repeat it."
Court of Ostrafoval for Violations of the “Agitation Subbotnik”
The Moscow court fined Aleksey Navalov for 300 thousand rubles for violating the order of the meeting.
The opposition was found guilty of the administrative offence provided for in article 20.2 of the FMF Co-AP "Recommendation of the organization of the meeting".
Former judge of the Simonov Court of Moscow, Hizir Mussakaev, concluded his consideration of the administrative case against Leonida Volkova, head of the opposition headquarters of Alexey Navalov, who was brought to justice under the same article as Navalov.
The wolves were found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300 thousand rubles.
In that amount, Judge Mussakaev assessed the distribution of the leaflets to the “agitation subbotnik”, which was carried out by the supporters of Avalowa in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
In the light of the agitt materials that followed the participants of the Saturday, the police thought that the organizers had deliberately concealed its true essence of public action (to which prior authorization must be sought by the capital authorities).
Leonid Wolkov and his lawyers Ivan Zdanov and Alexander Pomazuj have applied for a cessation of administrative proceedings in the absence of an offence and have indicated that the police have allowed certain gaps in the drafting of the protocol.
The Volkwa was not detained in the “agitation sub-station” itself, but he received an agenda that required him to appear at the police station to report on the event held during his active participation.
The same arrangements were made by Navala and another opponent, Nikolai Lyaskin.
In Mordovia, a shooting bride and three wedding guests were arrested
The court in Mordovia arrested a local man who shot four people at a wedding, including a bride.
This was reported in the Republican administration of the Investigation Committee.
The incident occurred on 29 July at night.
During the siege, a 42-year-old resident of Saranska shot several times at the guests who came to the village for redemption.
Three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case has been brought under article 213 (a), article 30 (e), article 30 (e), article 105 (e), article 105 (e), article 105 (e), article 105 (e), article 213, paragraph 1, and article 213, paragraph 1, paragraph 1, of the RF, paragraph 3, of the RF, paragraph 2, of the RF.
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man had opened fire because of the fact that the wedding guests had decided to redeem themselves and had passed his site to the water.
The miner will step up the requirements for turbine suppliers for power stations
The Ministry of Energy will update the rules for providing information to suppliers of critical equipment, in particular turbines for power stations.
At the start of gas turbines, gas turbines, gas pipelines, oil pipelines and oil supplies, equipment suppliers will be required to share access data with the Minergo and the Federal Technical and Export Control Service.
The draft Government decision is already ready and open to public discussion.
The new requirements will apply only to “critically important energy equipment” provided to Russia.
Potential threats are identified in the document as information and access to foreign services management, criminal elements and structures, non-profit partners and hackers.
The European Union has extended anti-corruption sanctions due to Siemens
The Euro Union Press Service stated on 4 August that anti-rision sanctions had been extended due to the scandal surrounding the supply of Siemens turbines in Crimea.
The Week Arguments have been reported earlier.
The EU Council Press Service stated that sanctions against the FP have been extended due to the Siemens production turbine scandals that were allegedly delivered to Crimea in the course of sanctions.
The Council of Europe today examines all possible complaints and proposals by Member States for the extension of anti-trust sanctions.
It was previously announced that the final decision would be taken by the end of the current day, and that decision had been taken, sanctions against Russia had been extended.
Person reduces another 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to return business to life
On Friday, the British education group of Pierson announced that it would reduce another 3,000 jobs and reduce the amount of early dividends by 72 per cent in connection with the start of the regular restructuring programme aimed at combating the problems faced by their businesses.
These reductions in jobs, which, according to John Fellona's head, will largely occur at the end of 2018 and in early 2019, will be added to 4,000 jobs reduced by previous restructuring.
Person announced that he was planning to reduce expenditure by another $300 million (US$394 million) in May during the third cost reduction programme to try to return to a business that had hit a fast transition to digital learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its share in the edition of the Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsman, said that its forecasts for the year remained constant after it announced an increase of 1 per cent in the first half of the year to 2.5 billion pounds.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: Private Nato was killed as a result of the deadly explosion
According to information from official sources, the suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and a translator were wounded, as NATO reported.
According to unverified local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of an accident in the city of Karabah.
This explosion was the last of Afghanistan’s bloodsheds this month: more than 30 people died on Tuesday as a result of an explosion in the mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people next to the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, an explosion that took place on Thursday evening occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked by a “carried person of a separate explosive device”.
According to the report, all wounded are in stable condition and are treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IG) in Karabakh is a major source of concern to NATO forces located near Bama.
In the first half of 2017, the United Nations reported that there were at least 1662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan, and about 20 per cent of them in the capital.
At the end of July, the suicide bomber on the car killed at least 30 people in the area of Shia in Kabul.
The Taliban claimed that they had made an attack.
On 31 May, as a result of a powerful explosion in the city centre, more than 150 people were killed — the most serious of human casualties in the country since the United States-led army removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence emphasizes the unsurpassed situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump assesses the need to increase the number of United States military forces assisting troops and police in the country.
According to the correspondents, the attacks in Kabul that have occurred in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the Government, its conduct, and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Gani.
The Agency for the Protection of the Environment, following judicial proceedings, annuls the decision to defer the adoption of the Air Pollution Act
The United States Environment Agency rejected the decision to postpone the Obama era law, whereby states should limit emissions of air pollutants within the day after 15 states were brought to court because of this step.
On Wednesday evening, the Environment Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called “zone measurement 2015”, stressing that this step shows the Agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
"We believe in dialogue with our partners in the states and responsiveness to them," said the head of the Environment Agency Scott Pruitt.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to postpone ozone measurements where existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced in order to meet stricter air purity standards for one year until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, together with the Federal District of Colombia, filed a complaint claiming that the intention was illegal.
The Administration of President Donald Trampa is trying to reverse the broad range of environmental protection orders introduced by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader programme aimed at improving economic growth, according to Trampa.
But action in this regard has been called for the resistance of democracies and environmental organizations concerned about the potential impact of large emissions on public health.
The Agency for Environmental Protection stated that the use of ozone-containing air could “decrease the function of light and increase respiratory symptoms”, such as asthma.
European Business Association has voiced against new anti-racial sanctions
The European Business Association disagreed with US economic sanctions against the RF.
In the opinion of AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
The AEB statement states that business is an important link between countries and people, so the principles of free trade cannot be restricted.
The European business brings together more than 500 companies from the countries of the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the Heads of State or Government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would enable business to be separated from politics and to find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and agreement.
Members ask the police to limit the movement on the coast in Pskova

It turns out that the capital repairs and well-being are done.
Sports and children ' s playgrounds are becoming uncomfortable because of cars.
As the Pskovsk Information Agency notes, the Central Coast Guard patrol officers of the PPS motor patrol and wives are patrolling the night.
They reduce the number of passenger cars, but do not stop moving completely.
Putin asked the investigating authorities not to take out hard disks.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, suggested that the investigative authorities should not be allowed to remove servers and hard disks from business computers.
The Head of State stated that this was the case at a meeting on the Investment Programmes for the Development of the Far East.
According to the President, "it is necessary to exclude the application for investigation of measures leading to the suspension of business activities, including the removal of hard disks from work computers and servers".
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need, “it is enough to remove copies, assure them and use them during the investigation”.
The Head of State added that it was not possible to “set up conditions that would prevent the business from continuing until it was impossible to pay taxes”.

British actor Robert Hardy's death
British actor Robert Hardy, who played the magic minister Cornelius Fajja in screening a series of novels about Harry Potter, died in the 92nd year of his life.
That's what the Independent newspaper reported on Thursday.
His relatives told him about the death of the actor.
According to them, he lived “a great life with success in cinema, theatre and television for 70 years of careers”.
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltenham.
In 1959 at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, he played with Lawrence Olivier in the Tragedy of Coriolan.
Hardy also recalled the repeated role played by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of Agata Christi's screenplays on Ms. Marple.
In order to play the role of Churchill in the Bi-bi-si video "Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years" (1981), he was awarded the British Academy of Cinematic and Television Arts (BAFTA).
Robert Hardy also had to play the role of US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Something went wrong in the Danish State: Prince Henrik, and in fact Henri Marie Jean Andre, Count de Labord, refused to be buried with his venerable wife, Queen Margaret.
This year, there's a "golden" wedding, but on the couple's agenda, it's not a Christmas party, it's a big fight.
His highness was denied the title of the Prince-Consort, and he associated it with the Queen, who never regretted the title of the King-Consort.
Henrik lives in France, although he remains an official queen's wife.
Mid Russia called on Washington to stop Shelmwa Moscow
In mid Russia, Mike Penz, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans, responded.
The relevant statement was circulated by the foreign policy department a while ago.
In his commentary, MIDI indicated that the United States was increasingly using cold war stamps, inadequate contemporary reality.
In addition, the Russian diplomats called on the American authorities to stop the Chelsea RF.
As US Vice-President Mike Pens recently wrote, Moscow accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and organize a failed coup in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasili Lomačenko meet for the first time, talking about the possibility of a decisive individual
Vasili Lomačenko and Mikey Garcia, who, according to all, are constantly moving to make the most exciting boxing match of up to 147 pounds in the near future, first met on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in ESPN's office rooms in Los Angeles, while Garcia, an uncertain champion in the lightweight of the World Boxing Council, did not go on the corridor to welcome Lomačenko, a World Boxing Organization champion in the second half.
Following the unanimous victory of Garcia over the former world champion in four Springs by Erien Broner on Saturday on the showtime channel, both boxers are among five best boxers regardless of the Weights.
Garcia stretched his right hand and said, "What's up, champ?
Good luck with you."
Lomačenko protects his belt in conjunction with Miguel Marriago on Saturday at seven o'clock in the ESPN channel.
When the boxers took the picture, manager Lomačenko Egis Klimas noticed that a potential decisive fight between them would be the same.
"I used to be in the middle of the day," Garcia recalled.
"I'm up for Bronger's category [up to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big anymore.
I'm a kid for 140.
I'd like to go down to bed.
And he's gonna have to get up to $135, and then we're gonna set up a unit.
That's what sick people want.
Let's make this work for them."
Lomakenko agreed.
"The box needs this unit."
Klimas asked whether the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service, as part of a strategy that he was required to carry out his first battle in the year 135 later this year, to appoint a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 nocouts) next summer, which was also interested in dealing with the winner of the single game between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the title of the World Cup in the lightweight Arena “Forum” on 23 September.
“Boy may be on the PPV because all the patients asked for it,” Garcia said, expressing a willingness to meet the channel that would offer the best financial conditions.
“We are the main names.
No other name will be of such interest.
As soon as they are ready.
Garcia said that he considered Lomačenko a "stimulating boxer" and might visit his Saturday unit.
But Lomačenko didn't start praising Garcia right away, and he said he thought the three-weight champion from Riverside looked "a bit slow, I'm sorry, Mikey... you're asking for a knockout."
Garcia said he was focused on showing the power of the strike, and then on the box.
They both said that they felt the tension in front of their own individual.
“This fight must take place.
None of the other battles are of such interest and conversation.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomačenko said, "I was expecting someone from the football boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
That will be a great struggle.
On several central streets, Moscow will move to the exits
In these exits, 5 and 6 August, the movement will be restricted to the capital at the Tverska Street of Nastasinsk, from the Nastasinsk Square to the Triumphal Square, as well as the 1st Tverska-Jamska Street.
In addition, the trip will be closed on the Leningrad Prospect, from the Third Transport Ring to the 1st Tver-Jam Street.
In all areas, the cover will operate on both sides, as reported by the Information Centre of the Department of Transport of Moscow.
The streets will reach from midnight on 5 August to 5 a.m. on 7 August due to their well-being.
The exits will also be closed to the Moscow coastal area.
It continues to set up the Záradi Park.
Putin ordered the Genproktor's Office to check the Baikal
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, ordered the Office of the Prosecutor-General of the FP to carry out a verification of the Baykal territory on the subject of illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
"Please check the Baikal territory for illegal and environmentally harmful activities," Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on environmental development in the region.
In addition, the Russian leader requested action if the facts of the violations were identified.
New test results for the assessment of the age of asylum seekers in Sweden have been published
The latest results of the asylum-seekers' tests in Sweden, which have undergone a new medical assessment of age, show that more than 80 per cent of those tested have been assessed as persons over 18 years of age, but not all trust the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Judicial Agency (Rätsmedicinilverket) began to conduct tests earlier this year.
They were designed to assess the age in the asylum process more precisely after the Swedish Migrationsverket was criticised for not being able to determine the present age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 trials, and the Judicial Agency has now published the results of 2,481 trials between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) of those tested were assessed as persons 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases, the judicial agency estimated that the tested “probably 18 years of age or older”.
In the case of 432 cases, the finding stated that the person “probably less than 18”.
Tests shall be carried out only where the age of a person has doubts.
According to Johan Garansson of the Judicial Medicine Agency, the results were consistent with the results of the past months.
“We don’t see much difference with statistics in the past months, numbers are quite appropriate,” he said to the “The Local” portal.
The high proportion of cases in which people were assessed as having reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers lied about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of the 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases “at the earliest, 18-year-olds tested”.
However, after considering 581 published results, the Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases the person openly stated that he was 18 this year.
The method of medical evaluation of the age of X-rays of the teeth of wisdom and tomography of the knee systems and the analysis of them to dentists and X-rays has also caused criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist from the Karolin Institute, Claude Marcus, whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people to determine whether they have been through sexual mutilation sooner or later.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think I should use the methods of measurement that are being used right now.
The biological age is thus defined very incorrectly.
If we can't determine it with confidence, we don't have to look what we can do," he said, "Metro."
However, Garanssen from the Judicial Medical Agency said in favour of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk of taking a child for an adult is mistaken.
We face the greatest risk when a person is about 18, then he's about 10 percent."
I wonder if I'm going to vote for the president's position.
During his work trip to Buryatia Vladimir Putin, who was willing to consider whether he would be elected President of Russia in 2018, the interface was handed over.
This statement was a response to the request of the inhabitants of the village of Ceremuki in the Buryat region.
During a video conference on the elimination of the fire in Burma and the Irkutsk region, the interviewer asked Putin, "Vladimir Vladimirovic, we have a request for you: when the following presidential elections will take place, we all ask you to re-buff this position."
"Okay, I think so, thank you," the President replied.
On 28 July, the President of Russia's Press Secretary Dmitri Peskov commented on the statements by some media that the pre-election headquarters of Vladimir Putin would be headed by the head of the President's administration, F.F. Anton Wayne.
Peskov called these assumptions "no groundless, hypothetical arguments".
"There are no headquarters yet, until the establishment of the headquarters is far away, until the election campaign is far away," said Peskov.
"It's not on the agenda," said Peskov.
The Governor of West Virginia said he was moving to another party
The Governor of West Virginia, the representative of the Democratic Party, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday at a meeting with President Tramp, which is taking place in another party.
"You like it or not, but the democracies are far from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I speak to you with many prayers and many thoughts... today I speak to you, people of West Virginia: I can no longer be of use to you as a Governor-democratic."
The meeting exploded with applause.
"That's why tomorrow I'm going to change my registration to a Republican," added Justice.
"As a coach, I'd tell you that it's time to play the other game."
Earlier, Trump promised that an important statement would be made at the meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won 42 per cent in West Virginia, and Justice did not support a candidate from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, because he inherited the coal business from his father.
It is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the National Committee of the Republican Party issued a statement Thursday night that “The return of Governor Justice to another party is another attack on the Democratic Party, which is more likely to interfere than it is working to make our country a big one again”.
“In view of the 15 governors and the control of the minimum number of state legislative bodies in history, the statement by Governor Justice is just another rejection of a party that does not have leaders above the bottom and is unable to find a positive, uniting message,” reported CBS News, a representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party Ron McDonnell.
Mr. Krasavčik's Kot-Gajaloves called found the house thanks to the soccess.
The Pittsboro Pittsboro, North Carolina, U.S.A., set up a cat named Mr. Krasavčík with a weight of over 14 pounds [14 kg] after he became famous for the Internet.
That's what Mashable says.
At the end of June, a photo of the cat was posted on Facebook in a Pithomb's account, asking him to find his owner, because "he's obviously had someone before him."
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the animal's morgue could become a new memento.
The publication received more than 3.2 thousand clays and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, ten people expressed the desire to accommodate Mr. Krasavčík.

Who praised Russia ' s “seeker” apology for the doping scandal
The international athlete Sebastian Kou commended him on Thursday for calling sincere excuses from Russia for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it was now a bad time to allow the country to participate again in the competitions.
The Russian representative of the Federation of Light Athletics Dmitry Schlachtin reported to the International Association of Light Athletics Federations Congress, which had preceded the World's Light Athletics Championship, that the removal of his country from sports competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized “to all sportsmen who had stolen gold and silver medals at the competitions”.
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Light Air Federations voted in favour of the withdrawal imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) issued a report on the evidence of the State-funded doping.
“I found that today’s response, today’s report was very sincere,” said the reporters to the President of the International Association of the Light-Athletic Federations of Kou.
“All the Council and Congress liked... that the Russian Federation itself recognized that it was experiencing extreme heat of time and is now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the Federation.”
Kou said he had also been “set up”, that Russia had agreed to the criteria for its recovery.
“I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Special Commission, according to which it is not time to restore Russia to rights now,” Kou said.
“For the next few months, we have to do everything we can to deal with this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean sportsmen from the impounded system," he added.
Nine Russian athletes, meeting the strict criteria of the International Association of Light-Athletic Federations, will be under the neutral flag to participate in the Light Athletic World Championship in London on Friday.
The head of the Special Commission of the International Association of Light-Athletic Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements had yet to be met for the reconstruction of Russia.
As he told the reporters in London after the report made on the Board of the International Association of Light-Athletic Federations, drug testing is still not being carried out in sufficient volume, and removed coaches are still quietly doing their work.
The court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of being a hosy
The detainee of the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) is a journalist, Vasili Muravicki, who has been arrested for two months, reports the SBU.
The Internet Poster Journal Zitomir is suspected of public change by posting its publications on Russian sites and affecting Ukraine's territorial integrity.
However, Russia does not support measures by the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering this as a “barbar policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy agreed to a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The Commandant Borsini patrol ship entered Libya's territorial waters to then stop the flow of illegal migrants along with the WIC.
The decision to initiate the operation was taken by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized Government of Libya, which, on the other hand, does not control most of the territory of the country.
The opposition cabinet and the Libyan Parliament based in Tobruk accused Italy of violating the sovereignty of Libya.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Feldmarshal Haftar, gave his command to oppose the Italian ships.
In Rome, however, it was stated that they did not believe these threats and intended to send another military vessel to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the talks of Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the Libyan Cabinet of Faiz Saradza recognised by Europe.
The Italian authorities went to establish a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after statistics on illegal immigrants from Libya were published in July: 95,000 people since the beginning of the year.
The Government stated that the resources for the reception of migrants had been exhausted.

Two leaders of the Ukrainian League on Light Athletics have removed from participation in the CMM
Olga Earthlak and Olese Povh, who are in the short run, have been excluded from the membership of Ukraine for the 2017 World Cup in London.
This is reported on the Federation's easy-to-use athletics site (FLAU).
Such a decision was taken by the team in connection with the launch of the International Association of Light-Athletic Federations (IAAF) of disciplinary proceedings in respect of light-athletics.
Coach Sergey Basenko has also been excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportarena, IAAF suspects sportsmen in the application of doping.
Povh is the bronze knight of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Championship, Europe-2010 champion at 4 to 100 metres, Earth - winner of the 2012 European Championship at 4 to 400 metres.
The World Championship on Light Athletics in London will take place from 4 to 13 August.
How financial rules affect the movement of Neimar to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing the unrestricted costs of European football clubs do not prevent the world record of the transfer of Neimar from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Pari San Germen.
Whatever the consequences may be in the chain, for Pari St. German by the UEFA, a leading body controlling European football, in which the teams are forbidden to participate in the prestigious League of Champions tournament.
According to the Financial Fair-platform Regulations introduced by WEFA in 2011, the GSP will ultimately have to show that Nimara's transfer was funded without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to free Brazil from the contract, and Naaman will receive a claim that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neimar's move to France.
The GSP can certainly be used to hire Neimar and add it to the galaxy of other stars if it takes into account the financing of the team by the rich energy of the Qatari family.
Clubs have the right to spend large amounts on the acquisition of players, but they have to be balanced on the basis of legitimate sources of income in order to achieve a level of profitability in their football business.
The FFP introduced Michel Platini after his election as President of WEFA in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs that were in huge debt in their pursuit of success were essentially, embalming and risking destruction if banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, FFP stopped focusing on the debt of clubs and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model originally used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 – buying a club with good potential and then seriously spending in order to improve the team and create a world brand – has become a difficult plan.
During this three-year evaluation period, which covers 2018, clubs can suffer losses of 30 million euros.
And despite the fact that the Platinum was removed from the presidential post in 2015, his successor to the UEFA Alexander Cheferin is still determined to stop excessive traffic.
“It is understood that FFP is alive, and we are moving forward to tighten the rules,” said Associated Press, Andrea Traverso, who controls FFP at WEFA last week.
Although the PSC will pay the purchase of the Nimara contract at the same time, it may distribute that amount for accounting for the entire duration of its contract.
Naaman signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in the annual accounts as costs of €44.4 million over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, more severe sanctions were applied to PSCs, as well as to Abu Dhabi, Manchester City.
A fine of 60 million euros was imposed for the PSC (the course was 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and it was prescribed to limit the composition of its team to the League of Champions during the 2014-1015 season by 21 players instead of ordinary 25.
WEFA is tracking clubs that may try to intercept their financial inspections by disbursing their income from the company owners.
Although a Qatari company would be able to propose a PSC, but if the amount of funding was considered to exceed the standard market prices, WEFA would not allow it to be considered as a legitimate income.
That is exactly what happened in 2014, when WEFA decided that the amount of funding for SGEI by the Qatar Tourism Office had been distributed.
It was reported that the part of Nimara's salary in the PSC could have been paid by the Organizational Committee of the 2022 Peace Championship in Qatar.
But the PSGs and Qatar-2022 deny that Neimar will be the ambassador of the world champion, and such a maneuver could easily be found by WEFA inspectors.
The previous sanctions imposed on the GSP mean that WEFA will be more careful to monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules.
As reported in Thursday by the people familiar with the situation, WEFA did not hold preliminary discussions with the PSC on the transfer of Neimar.
They contacted the Associated Press agency on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the PWG.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016, the GSP received more than 10 million euros in turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have not yet been published.
The PSC expects the arrival of Nimara to be a favourable ground for sponsoring transactions, sales of attributes and team logos.
At the club, trade is expected to grow by at least 30 per cent as a result of the new game.
Doubtless that one of the best footballers was missing, the Spanish League tried to prevent the transfer of Neimar, claiming that the PSC would violate the financial fair-play.
“This is an obvious case of “financial doping”, with the club and the state,” said the Spanish newspaper “AS” President La Ligi Javier Thebas, meaning that the final owner of “PSW” is Qatar.
Arsenala Coach Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnet, shares his doubts about the financing of the club by the State.
“This is all the consequences of left participation, and this has completely changed the football landscape in the last fifteen years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
"When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It would be very difficult to comply with the financial fair-up, because countries could have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
Order and place of oath shall be determined by the President
Where and as new Russian citizens will swear on the loyalty of the FP, the President - such amendments to the second reading in the relevant law - will be determined by a committee of the Parliament on legislation and reconstruction.
A week ago, the MPs planned to directly determine the order of the oath in the law.
From the birth of a solemn oath, children under the age of 18, as well as disabled, should be exempted from the amended text of the draft law “About the nationality of the FP” (which is under the title “Reports”), which the Committee will consider before the second reading of its meeting on 11 July.
The idea of a sworn entry into the nationality of the FF instead of a formal signature of the documents was supported by President Vladimir Putin on 6 June during a meeting with the speaker, Mr. Vajeslav Volodin.
Members formulated this idea as an amendment to the second reading of the bill to abolish a decision on extradition of nationality to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of terrorist or extremist crimes: for example, for public appeals to terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (art. 2, art. 205.2, CFC RF), as well as for aircraft, travel or water transport, but only in the event of a terrorist act (art. 4 CFC RF).
According to the bill, the logic of the bill was this: by formulating documents for citizenship, a person is under an undertaking to comply with Russian law - he has become on the path of extremism, and he violates that promise.
The bill was introduced in April by the leaders of the Vosdamudum of the political factions Vladimir Vasiliev (the only Russia), Gennady Zuganov (KPRF), Vladimir Girinovski (LDPR), Sergey Mironov (the Justice of Russia) and the speaker, Mr. Vyacheslav Volodin.
On 19 May, the Members adopted it at first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on Construction and Law approved the draft law for second reading, but has now been recast.
It now states that the oath order will be established by the President of the FP.
Earlier, parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the RF Citizenship Act, stating that the ceremony should be held in a solemn setting in front of the State Herb and the flag of Russia in the presence of the representative of the IMF.
However, the text of the bill did not make it clear where such an event should take place - a list of places where the location of the RF station could be regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, cabinets of heads of government of entities, municipal education, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executives, etc.
It could probably be Zags.
Making a solemn oath to obtain the nationality of the RF will be after officials check their documents.
But the Russian passport will only be obtained after the oath is made out of a completed text.
A week ago, the project said that the oath should precede the signing of the order.
The updated text states that the Russians will be sworn for 18 years rather than for 14.
There was still a rule on which the oath would be exempted from being made incapacitated or incapacitated, as well as those who could not express, read or sign the oath itself.
In addition, the President of the FP has the right to exempt from this procedure and “other persons”,
The updated bill also provides for a special procedure for the admission of Russian citizens of Ukraine, who are considered Russian-speaking.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship by making an appropriate statement to the authorised authority of Ukraine for that purpose.
A notary certified copy of the statement will have to be submitted to the Russian officials.
Refusal of “foreign” citizenship, as it is now, will not be required if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is impossible “for reasons other than the person”.
The relevant amendment to the law was proposed by a group of MPs, including the first vice-president of DG Ivan Melniki (CPRF), Natalia Polonski, Pavel Krašininikov and Irat Farrahov (the only Russian).
I think many of you know that getting a deal with Ukraine is not real, it's just impossible.
Accordingly, many people are waiting to decide their fate on the nationality of the RF, as explained earlier by the head of the think committee on the construction and legislation of Pavel Krasheninnikov (ER).
In addition, the text made it clear that restrictions on the employment of certain foreign posts would not apply to those who had given up "other" citizenship in writing and had submitted a former passport to the Russian IMF, but had not ceased to be considered a national of another country “on its own grounds”.
Foreigners are now forbidden to hold municipal posts, be admitted to work on facilities and in organizations related to the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual nationality or a type of residence may not become a Member of the House or a member of the Council of the Federation.
It is planned that the law should enter into force from 1 September 2017 and that the necessary legislation should be prepared by now.
Nostalgia is becoming a ninja in "The Black American Summer" and "The Detective's Tower"
The present iteration of history is nostalgic at the same time as the glorious days of characters in the 1980s; the era of the border in the 1990s (i.e., at a time when the eminent masters David Wayne and Michael Schwalter made a "State" comedy for MTV); and on themselves, that is, the year 2001, before its stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poler and Paul Radd, had gone to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time an increase in our era and its constant reminders from Facebook.
But she looks like an anachronism.
"The first day of the camp" was a great surprise, not just because of the absurdistic humor (including the original story of the talking plant bank, which H. John Benjamin sounded).
The result is double the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have only reached adulthood; this makes it impossible to return to the joke.
"Ten years later," where adults played by adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its periphery is more unsystemic and includes riffs from the 1990s steel films of the "Hungary-Handing Claw."
In one episode, the personage is given Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled role-playing horses and a "house of other things since 1991".
A lot of these steps are the same.
The Good-will Cup (Schoalter), now a writer, has not yet gained a mutual interest in Katie (Margerit Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet given up on virginity.
And there's still a foolish and false conspiracy in which Ronald Reagan (also Showalter) is now instigating George Bush-Old (test parade by Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of the French is the retreat from it.
It's especially fun to see a young Radda singing Matt Dillon's song from "Odinochek", whose character, the former great man Andy now looks old-fashioned.
The success of this French could be random nonsense in the spirit of the recursive series "Seven Up" until it comes to its logical conclusion: "The American Hot Summer: twenty years later", where in the final stage the whole company would be filming at the premiere of the "The American Hot Summer".
The "Deputy Detective" in the Amazon refers to another kind of nostalgia: memories of the Cold War of Americans, Explosive Blonde or even Blesca with its images of the East and West struggle.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Riz Thomas, depicts a telefilm: the Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for the truth, atheism and Marxist-Lenin road.
The main roles -- Gregor's life and the idealist Joseph -- are Florin Piersik-younger and Corneliu Ulic, and their dialogues were sounded in English by Chenning Tatum (the same executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are several visual jokes (polices spend time watching a chess match as Americans could watch football).
The team of well-known votes for the staff -- Jenny Slett, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Seviny -- makes it interesting to play in the "magnificent voice".
But the Detective's director is so concerned with the possibility of an unencumbered propaganda drama -- there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask -- which he often looks like.
Six long episodes are delayed, and the fun is not very often.
If it were to do so slowly, the "Deputy Detective" could better deal with his satire in the spirit of an agit prop; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American Embassy, there are two fat men sitting in the lobby, hugging a bunch of hamburgers.
This image to the imaginary viewer-communist says that Western culture is capable of doing whatever it is possible to do.
The fictional Romanian film authors are not so wrong: we are doing so with our own recent history, and with theirs too.
The Russian Supercoubon Football Championship between Spartacus and Locomotive is about 30 million rubs.
The President of the Russian Football League (RFPL) announced this at the press conference.
According to the RFPL chapter, the winner will receive 70 per cent of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that there were almost no tickets to the match to date.
The Spartacus match will take place on Friday, 14 July, at 21:30.
As TAC notes, Spartak is the current RF champion, and Locomotiv is the owner of Cuba.
Two young hummingbirds cleaned up the furniture for 200 thousand rubles
During the day, a 37-year-old firefighter with a furniture company approached the police.
The man said that he had stolen expensive tools from the shop, which had seriously damaged his production.
The product was made up of nearly 200 thousand rubles — two wires, a perforator, a plumber, a plumber.
The guards began to search for criminals and soon went out to the residents of the Bladevesten region of Bascortostan, friends 23 and 24.
According to the media services of the IMF, the media entered the territory of the enterprise, broke the entrance door and issued tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold stolen the first stolen car service.
They had already been committed to stealing, and the rightholders had been able to return only part of the stolen instruments to the legitimate owner.
Mr. Medvedev commented on the relationship between the FP and the United States
The United States of America and Russia should be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of Mr. Hizer Nawert in response to the words of the Prime Minister of F.R. Dmitria Medvedev on the relationship of two States.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Government stated that, following the adoption of new anti-racial sanctions, the United States had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and had declared the RF a full-fledged trade war.
While commenting on these words, Nawart acknowledged that the Russian-American relations were "low", but noted that "interference areas need to be sought".
"Look at the peace in the south-west of Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," says the RIA diplomat Novosti.
However, the representative of the foreign political agency refused to comment on the statement of the Russian Prime Minister that the sanctions were equivalent to the trade war.
The draft law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the CDR was signed by the President of the United States by Donald Trump in the past.
He acknowledged, however, that the document was unsuccessful and contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior has grown roses from amethysts and quartz
The French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - filled the Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose collections.
There were five new wheels and three wheels on bartender strips.
Rose Dior Pré Catelan has two new rings and balloons from amethysts, pink quartz and brilliants performed in gliptic technique (hand cutting on stone) and respect for 70-year-olds at home.
The head of Dior Joaillerie Victoria de Castellan was inspired by the roses that grew in its place in Granville by Christian Dior, and by the Paris gardens of Baghal and Pre-Catelan.
Trump found guilty of maltreatment with Russia
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, gave a sharp criticism of the members of the Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at a low and dangerous level.
"You can thank the congress, these same people can't even give us medicine," the president wrote on Twitter.
Donald Trump has recently signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the PRC.
In particular, they will affect Russian banks and energy companies.
The White House subsequently circulated the President ' s statement, which indicated that the law would not allow the United States to enter into beneficial transactions and would further close the ranks of RF, China and North Korea.
Belorussian entrepreneur refused to buy the Ukrainian daughter Sberbanka
An entrepreneur from Belarus, Viktor Prokoppenja, withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) an application for the purchase of the subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessmen's decision explained the RBC's intention to "focus on other of our planned investments and projects that we are working on".
According to Mr. Prokopni, such a step would be "better time", despite the investment attractiveness of the Sberbank daughter.
Mr. Prokopenia was the main candidate for the purchase of the Russian Bank in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the NorvikBank consortium's request by Güsselnik and by Said Gucerieva, a Belarusian company.
The Russian banks began to abandon the Ukrainian market after President Petri Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One such financial organization -- apart from WTB and Foreign Economic Bank -- became Sberbank.
Novak called the cause of the crime in Crimea.
In the Ministry of Energy, the RF called the cause of the blackout in Crimea.
The head of the department, Alexander Novak, made an explanation of what had happened.
According to him, the peninsula was powerless due to a road accident in the territory of Krasnodar.
As a result, the loaded truck has switched off the power transmission line and has turned off the Cuban and related Crimean networks.
The electrical failure of major Crimean cities was recorded last week.
Specialists have solved the problems over several hours.
It was initially reported that the cause of the blackout could have been an abnormal fire.
Bank of England will retain interest rates at 0.25%
It is expected that the Bank of England will later announce that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have led to hearings of a possible increase.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain unsustainable and left interest rates unchanged in the face of increasing pressure on family income.
The Bank's Finance Policy Committee (MPC) had voted with a rate of 6 against 2 to 0.25 per cent, while the Committee's fewer members had expressed increased rates this month, as weak economic growth had weakened its support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank limited its forecast to an increase of 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that family income pressure would continue, while still expected inflation to rise to about 3% in autumn.
However, the Bank warned that a higher rate in the next few years would be necessary to control the inflation rate, and stated that loan costs would probably have to be higher than expected in the financial markets.
The members of the Committee also voted in favour of abandoning part of the public package of economic development measures launched a year ago due to the shortness.
As of next February, the bank will close the emergency financing plan that it will provide banks with cheap loans, although it has announced that it will now have to provide up to $15 billion in the plan.
In the rate decision-making protocol, the bank said: “According to the main projections of MPC, the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) remains slow in the near future, while the pressure on real family income continues to influence consumption”.
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that in order to stop inflation, there would be a need for “some increase in financial policies” to be “a little more” than expected by markets.
At this point, markets predict the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases would be “stepping” and “limited”.
The Bank's forecast to increase this year and next year is below the forecast made in May, which was 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank has kept its forecast unchanged at 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After that news, sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound dropped by 0.5 per cent to $1.31 and by 0.4 per cent to €1.11.
The decision not to change the rate was made after the recent slowdown in growth rates was expected to increase; GDP increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter compared to 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, growth will, in general, remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank's latest inflation report gave little reason for the joy of the households, which had been hit by high inflation and a very small increase in wages: the bank said the pressure would be increased before it was reduced.
The Bank added that the financial policy “can’t prevent” the pay gap in the next few years, but expects the salaries “significant” to be restored to the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also geared towards growth as a result of increasing demand for British goods due to the low rate of the pound, which compensates for some of the low consumption costs.
The decision was taken a year after the rate was reduced to 0.25% in the past August following the shocking outcome of the Euro-Union withdrawal referendum.
It is estimated that it will take four years to fully influence prices and economies.
Before the bank made its last decision at the rates, it had grown the noise around the expected increase in the rates, as inflation had increased to and so severe domestic pressure: three in the committee had requested an increase to 0.5 per cent in July.
Last month inflation fell to 2.6 per cent from 2.9% in July, although the Bank reported that it was expected to fall and that it would be recompensated in the coming months.
According to the Bank, a higher rate than planned 2 per cent is entirely due to a low rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco's Mortgage Brokers, said: "If you take into account the recent decline in soup rates, the mortgage market will become even more competitive again, as creditors require business opportunities and look forward to a good year's end.
The market is particularly favourable to those approaching the end of their existing treaties, as refinancing of loans often becomes popular with the absence of a commission, as well as with a low rate."
The Public Health Service will prescribe the HIV-sponsored drug of 10,000 people
As of September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” drug for the prevention of HIV after a battle in the High Court on the financing of the drug from the Public Health Service.
The National Health Service of England announced that pre-exposure prevention of HIV (PRE), a pre-exposure tablet, which has been proven to reduce the risk of infection in people at risk, by an average of 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service for the initial three-year trial period of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal had supported the High Court ' s ruling last year, which claimed that the National Health Service had the opportunity to pay the EPR, despite her statement that it should be funded by local authorities.
This step, announced on Thursday, was called “the most important innovation” by the president of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called it “a turning point”.
Prior to the full launch of the whole of England by April 2018, weenological distributors in London, Briton, Manchester, Liverpool and Cheffield will begin to register, and even more distributors will join the program in October.
Pre-exposure prevention (PRE) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
According to studies, PREP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
At the time of the adoption of the PREP before sex in the human body, a sufficient number of specific drugs are available to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicinal products may be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients entitled to the medicinal product are homosexual and bisexual men, transgenders and people whose HIV partners are positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Distributors will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals whose partners are not aware of whether their HIV status is inhibited by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and prescribed for general practice in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venological dispenser participating in the programme.
The programme will be worth 10 million pounds, and the National Health Service of England signed a drug supply contract this week after the international tendering tender.
The study is designed to assess all possibilities for the PREP to account for the collection of clinical data on who is the target auditor of the product, on its viability and on its wide application.
“This critical innovation must complement and strengthen the broader and more successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone for more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the greatest health threats facing mankind.
Debor Gold, President of NAT, said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PREP, if it is addressed in writing to people in need of assistance and at risk, allows for a change in the situation of the HIV epidemic in England.
As of September, people in the HIV risk group will be given access to a new open-ended resource, without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many lives.
We warmly welcome this news."
Jan Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Fund, said: “The first thing we need to do now is to make sure that the trial is spread quickly throughout the country, and that none of the risk groups on HIV are forgotten.
Now that we are provided with a PREP pilot, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people in the HIV risk zone.”
The TEN Minister of Public Health Sharon Hodgson said: “We very much welcome the start of the PRE test, it has been very late due to months of delays and delays by the Government.”
The data show how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this disease.
This test will bring us closer to the full understanding of the benefits of the EPR.
It is now important that the test be developed as soon as possible throughout the country to protect those at risk of HIV and to move us further towards halting the spread of HIV in society.
The World Tatar Congress adopted a resolution on the support of the Tatarstan and Russia treaty
The Sixth Meeting of the World Tatar Congress (WCT) adopted a resolution highlighting the importance of maintaining the President's post in Tatarstan.
According to the paper, the post is “good for the recommended form of organization of the highest government in the Republic and expressing the national interests of the whole Tatar people”.
In addition, the meeting stressed the importance of a treaty on the separation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan in the resolution.
According to the document, he “played a positive role in the ethnic, socio-economic and social and political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole”.
The treaty between Moscow and Kazan has been concluded for 10 years since 24 July 2007.
On 11 July, Mr. Tatarstan's deputies requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and retain the position of head of the region.
Tatarstan is now the only entity in the Federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose post is called the President.
There have been difficulties in obtaining international driving rights in Russia
IBRD units have a lack of international driving licences (IMUs).
In order to obtain such rights, we have to wait a few weeks, which has become a problem for vacationers who want to go abroad on their car or take it on their way.
It should be noted that the situation with international driving licences remains contradictory.
IPU was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written in the national certificate, as the information is explained in five languages.
Requirements for international rights are recorded in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but Russian rights are recognized in the countries ratifying the Vienna Convention.
However, everything depends on specific police or prosecution offices: some require IMI and some have enough national rights.
In order to ensure that international rights drivers still receive, it should be borne in mind that in non-ratified countries (e.g., the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize national rights or ITUs.
There is a problem with patterns in almost all IDBD units, reports Commersant, carrying out a study in a number of regions.
So, in Moscow, the UGIBDDs simply don't give up, the blanks don't last four months.
You can sign up for the guest service website, but it's already grown in the middle of August.
It is impossible to obtain “for technical reasons” in the Red Sea, but not in detail, in the Samara region, they say that there are no patterns, and the situation is similar in other cities.
The problem has already been faced by many mosquitoes, and the following messages are becoming more and more common:
Irina Burmistrov: "Think, why can't you get international rights in Moscow?"
That's right, because all IDBD offices have completed the blanks.
Elena Podkolzina: "Question of the people who know."
International rights must be acquired very urgently.
In Moscow all the time, far ahead, there are no talents in the place (there are no nails, but the talent can't give).
Some kind of goose-serving portal shows that in Spob time is free to figa.
Did anyone try to get in another town?
Does it work?
As explained in the IMF RF, the requirements for international driving licences have changed, and the Gosavto Inspection Unit is therefore responsible for the delivery of new forms.
This may be related to the deficit, but it is not clear what changes have been made in the past.
Blanky purchases the Special Purpose Centre for Road Traffic Safety (CSNBD) MDF and then supplies it to the IDBD unit.
In recent years, all contracts have been concluded with Goznak OO: in 2014-2015, almost 200 thousand IMU forms have been manufactured, in 2016, 15,000 forms have been purchased, in 2017, 90 thousand, but the last contract has been concluded with the OOO on July 18th with the "First Print Court" for the manufacture of 70,000 forms.
There's a version that the CNC just failed to conduct a tender in time, which is why a deficit has arisen.
On the other hand, there are other versions of the shortage of forms: because of the crisis, many people have become independent not in Europe, but in cheaper Asian countries, China, Thailand and so on.
What rights there are, to the end, is unclear and therefore people are insured, and therefore there is a high demand for international "steps".
It has recently become known that professional drivers will have to pass a test to confirm their qualifications.
Mintrans made such a proposal.
The International Driving Certificate (ILO) of the new model has been in force since 31 May 2011.
Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
Ukrainian Justice Minister Pavel Petrenko said he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
On Friday, August 4, he said in an interview with the Guardian portal.
No respectable international company will even put a bullet or a trigger there, because it risks losing its business in the EU, the US, Japan, in countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia on Crimea.
"That is, in my opinion, there is actually no prospect of this project," Peterenko said.
He added that Russia considered it impossible to implement a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build less large facilities.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, all the stadiums have been destroyed.
"That is why I think that the best instrument in this situation is sanctions against companies that have been so short-sighted to join this project," said the officer.
On 31 July, the builders completed the construction of the tank of the Crimean Bridge.
A massive collection of the Kremian Bridge road ark was completed on the shore of the Church Coast: it will be closed at a height of 45 metres from the base of the construction.
“At the same time, bridge builders have prepared a railway ark to be installed on ferry stations”, reported at the project information centre.
In April, President Vladimir Putin of Russia informed Mintrans Maxim Sokolov that the site was being set up with a timetable.
The Crimean Bridge joins the Crimean Peninsula and the Krasnodar Coast.
In Spain, an officer who had not been at work for 10 years was fired
What angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) did the Spanish official Charles Resio have to have?
The permanence has grown for 10 years.
However, Mr. Resio was fired.
But not his direct boss.
What the bureaucrats don't do in the world.
The inhabitants seem to have been used to all the horrors of the "servants of the people."
And yet, officials are always amazed at those whose taxes are not bad.
This time, the "sensation" was apologizing to Spain.
There the archive officer of Valencia Carles Resio hesitated to go to work for ten years.
As a result, he received a regular complaint.
It's all solid, 50 thousand euros a year.
And here's Mr. Resio's "Wonderful Times" over.
He was dismissed by the Valencia Legislative Assembly.
In the investigation, it was found that the malicious walker came to the office every morning at 07:00 to check in the electronic system.
And he's gone home.
Once again, he appeared at work at 4:00 to re-evaluate the system that he left.
That's 10 years.
It was also known that all the leisure time the walker devoted himself to drawing comics at home.
The members of the Valencian Legislative Assembly now think how to punish Mr. Resio, who could not know how to "work actively" in his workplace.
The Judges propose to protect from the Presidents
The President ' s Human Rights Council (HR) under the direction of Vladimir Putin made proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The SHR proposes that the powers of the Presidents of the courts be limited and that they be elected.
For the Courts of Appeal and the Court of Cassation, the SPS wishes to introduce special districts that will not be linked to the administrative and territorial division in the FP.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals under the presidential mandate.
The SHR has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen Russian justice independence.
This work was carried out by the PSC on behalf of Vladimir Putin of 3 January 2017, which the President, following a meeting with the members of the Council, gave.
The meeting with the members of the Council on 8 December 2016 was discussed, including individual cases of the judiciary, as well as issues of public control at the places of detention (see “U” of 9 December).
The SHR's work has resulted in 25 proposals relating to both the independence of judges and the identification of judicial errors and the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of Crimean human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the Presidents of the courts to enhance the independence of the other judges.
If a candidate for a judge has successfully passed the competition and has received support from the judicial community, the President of the court, in the opinion of the SPC, must submit him for appointment without having the right to refuse as the law now permits.
It is also proposed to deprive the President of the right to allocate cases for trial between judges.
In doing so, experts are allowed to write a special computer program.
The SPS also considers that the President is not entitled “to determine the results of a judge's qualification assessment, to initiate his involvement in disciplinary responsibility, to take decisions on the establishment of additional material payments”.
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to “elect the Presidents of the Courts themselves” and to “give them powers for a relatively short term with binding rotation”.
All the Presidents of the Court (from the Republic to the District) are now appointed for six years by the President of the Supreme Court of the FP.
In order to protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the SHR proposes to reorganize appeals and appeals in courts of general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative and territorial division in the RF.
The SPS states that “it is necessary to ensure that individual courts of appeal and cassation are organized, not at the level of the regional judicial authorities, in the FP entities, but in the districts of the courts.”
The experts are based on the practice of arbitral tribunals.
There are "judgment districts" that do not coincide with the administrative division in the FP, but which guarantee greater independence from regional officials who have difficulty in using "telephone law".
The World Court of Justice of the SHR proposes to strengthen the people's advisers to consider with them certain “civil and administrative categories”.
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, the restoration of work, the protection of honor and dignity, the deprivation of driving rights, etc.
"It's just our proposals," explained the "U" member of the SHR, a judge of the Constitutional Court in the resignation of Tamar Morštakov.
She also recalled that the President ' s mandate was not only for the SPS, but also for the Supreme Court (HR), which had not yet revealed its proposals.
There is still time to carry out the mandate of the HR (with the Executive Office of the Genprocurator and the Human Rights Commissioner in the FP).
To report to Vladimir Putin on the effectiveness of the RF's independence, the Chair of the V.S. Vyacheslav Lebedev should be held until 1 September.
Living a long life: half- and three-way designers have turned this small apartment into an apartment in Earls Court.
Joan Lee, a former real estate repairer, moved from a space house in Nightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of the typical house in the style of Queen Anna, and for the benefit of the new design it says that Joan did not collect her things and moved again.
"I used to live with my ex at Nightsbridge in a much bigger place," says Joan.
“I wanted something comparable to my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were the same high ceilings.
“I fell in love with her, and I offered her the price of that day.”
Since the first inspection of the apartment in 1,000 square feet, it has undergone complete reconstruction.
It was originally an apartment with one bedroom complex – to get into the bedroom, it had to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add space to store things and pools to get the most benefit from the generous height of the floors.
“I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of lights.
Those were my demands," she says.
To this end, she hired Erfana Azadi from the Notting Hill architectural and design studio Duck & Shed, to use 12.5 feet high ground floor and to create a home that would not only be a successful project but would allow Joan to live.
It was not high enough to build two rooms above each other, so the architectural task was to create a pool where full growth could be achieved.
Erphane had to think creatively to deal with the briefing.
“Working with permanent structures is very difficult,” he explains.
“We had to lay the premises so that they were above each other, and we didn’t have to move.
It was not simply necessary to build a simple platform, but to avoid structures so that they could be at the right height and allow the upper and lower spaces to be used.”
This decision allowed Erfan to set up two full-sized rooms above each other in the remote area – and still very interesting.
With a poultage through the windshield light window from “Retrovius” opens a kind of smooth hotel below.
The mirror furniture with a gold-plated section, silver accents and vintage lighting equipment from Serja Muya is a design style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding visibility, space and light.
A short corridor covered with mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror protection panel looks like a window in another room.
The mirror cabinets at the entrance are used to store all Joan's vessels.
In order to create a feeling of more spacious space, the beauty of the hotel can be built into a kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new in the kitchen.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's moving up the door like it's in the garage.
“Technical art has been employed here,” Erfan relates about an armed steel wood-volcanic shield door.
“It’s equipped with resistance, so when you push the door up, it’s very easy.”
Because of the reasonable use of space and storage facilities, Joan received additional 16 square meters, additional bedroom and improved planning.
“At the end of the day, the sex scene is exactly what you’re going to sell, that is, what your real estate is valued for,” Erfan says.
“A real estate agent will, in a harsh way, enter and make bills based on sex.”
They have been able to increase the area of sex by using quality materials that add shine to the area.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection to the home,” says Erfan.
“No one falls in love with the electric conductor in the walls.
It's important, but it doesn't touch the strings of our hearts."
This is evidence that, for a good design and an increased meter of accommodation, something usually turns out to be amazing.
Actually, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
Government approved the establishment of a commission on cultural policy
The Government of Russia approved the establishment of a State Cultural Policy Commission.
The order was published on the Government ' s website.
According to the document, the Commission's main task will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to cultural policy.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, clarify tasks and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The Chief Commission shall be appointed Vice-President of the Government of the FP.
The composition of the Commission will be adopted separately.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved a plan for the implementation of the public cultural policy strategy by 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and measures to increase the influence of Russian culture in other countries, preserve a single cultural space and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to creating conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries has decreased to a minimum of eight years
Consumer prices in the G20 countries have decreased to a minimum of eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, referring to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
The OECD estimates that inflation rates in June 2016 were 2 per cent lower in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7 per cent.
Earlier, Rosstat reported a decline in Russia's consumer price index of 0.1 per cent.
The department therefore recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The rate of inflation in Russia, according to Minfin, is 4.1 per cent.
Mineconomies, however, believe that the target value has already been achieved, according to the department, is 4 per cent.
Putin warned against the illegal cutting of the Baikal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned of the illegal destruction of forests during the meeting on environmental development in the Bicalian Natural Territory.
In the process, the Minister of Natural Resources Sergei Donski noted that the bill had been prepared earlier.
It allows the forest to be cut off while the fires are being extinguished, and the Government plans to adopt it in the autumn.
In turn, the President said that the project should be monitored to ensure that the cut-off process “does not cut all the gear”.
Donsky noted that the draft law implied control by the PMS and the oversight agencies.
Media: VSU fighters secretly negotiate with Colonel Donbass
A regular telephone connection has been established on the basis of the armed resistance in Donbasse.
Fighters of the opposing parties constantly communicate with each other on mobile phones, and they do not know about this communication in headquarters.
The VSU fighters and Colonel Donbass have made a secret call on the hundreds of phones from their high command.
On 4 August, Strana.ua reported on this with reference to the Donbass military participants.
According to the publication, the commanders of the units know the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them on the telephones every day.
Communication is not at home at all: the commanders are trying to reach some “tactic arrangements”.
The results of such discussions are often a realignment at a certain point in the front.
Journalists were informed of the cases when congratulations were received by an officer on the day of birth on the basis of the front line from his regular enemy.
The VSU fighters and DND and LNR militias are on the verge of a separation since spring 2014, when Ukraine launched a war against Donbass.
Mid-MID induced the blocking of UNSCR statements on FP embassies attacks
The Russian foreign political agency is sorry for the actions of individual Western diplomatic representatives who block UN-Suprez's statements in the press condemning the terrorist attacks of the RF Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian IID.
The department recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus was shot by terrorists of Heyat Tahrir Ash-Sham (former "Jabbath An-Nushra" banned by the FF) and "Fileak Ar-Rahman" for the third time on 2 August.
Taking into account that the international community unanimously qualified as a terrorist organization, and UNSCRs called for countering that structure, the IMF noted that “it would be clear to us that the Nusra attacks must meet a general unconditional and firm condemnation, and that the evaluations against diplomatic missions should not be ambiguous”.
However, as emphasized in the diplomacy, “for the third time a month, US, UK, France and Ukraine diplomatic representatives in the United Nations Security Council have, by and large, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard draft statement of the Security Council for the press condemning terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic representation in the Syrian capital, by varying the tone of objection.
The unwillingness to show diplomatic solidarity with us let us remain conscious of those delegations.
“The most disturbing thing is that the failure of the Security Council to condemn terrorist acts encourages them to new provocations and acts, gives them impunity,” said the media and added that “these barbarians do not want to have the conviction that someone in the Security Council is with them.”
Vladimir Putin suggested limiting the number of foreign business inspections
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, said during the project meeting in the Far East, that the number of out-of-plan inspections by entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30 per cent of the planned number, and that it was necessary to limit the time for inspections to be limited by 10 percentage points.
“Explanatory checks are usually carried out without agreement with the prosecutor’s office; only 2-3 per cent agrees with the prosecutor’s office, all of which go independently,” quoted the President of the TACS.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be prohibited from taking servers and hard disks on businesses.
In addition, in the opinion of the President, business associations should be entitled to protect the interests of their members in court.
"I hope that some position will be taken into account in cases relating to business activities or in cases relating to a breach of the law in the area of business," said the Head of State.
As reported by U, the moratorium on planned inspections has increased the number of other types of inspections by entrepreneurs.
In May, an inquiry was conducted with the President of Russia, Boris Titova, who found that there was a real replacement of the planned checks (the proportion of them encountered increased from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), the prosecutors (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), the redistributions (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent), and the checks on citizens' statements (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations (10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).
More on business checks in the "U" material "The small business has gone from one side to the other".
Brothers fight for the real estate empire of more than $500 million
Two brothers fight for one of the largest in the state of Victoria's empires in real estate worth more than $500 million, 40 years after their Italian ancestors founded a dynasty.
The former director of Carlton's football club and co-founder Colin de Lutís live in the court of Turk through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a claim against him in the Supreme Court for a division of ownership and assets.
Paul wants to leave the family business since 2014, but in the Supreme Court there is still a heated dispute about the terms of divorce.
Together with their mother, Anna's brothers own 87 objects worth more than half a billion dollars, bought since their family bought a shop in Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 trading points.
It was sold in 1999 for 85 million dollars.
Money was invested in real estate, and the De Lutís family's list today includes office buildings, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments in the Zoloto Beach and Mount Buller and malls in the suburbs.
According to the deceased father Colin, whose father Paul describes as the "main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family, he owns about two thirds of the company's assets, and Paul is about one third.
According to the court, this means that Colina's property is 316 million and Paul is 176 million.
The division of property and money became the cornerstone for Paul.
"The division proposed by Colin gives him, in my view, the best parts of the property," he wrote in his first presentations in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts to reconciliation, the first hearings were held in the Supreme Court.
The brothers will now dispute who will control the existing business, from which Paul considered Colin excluded it.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of mismanagement of certain objects.
In his statements given to Colin at the beginning of the process, he said he hoped to settle the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me consider the family a top priority," he wrote.
The trial costs are growing as a snowcomb: hundreds of pages of testimony, e-mails and reports of companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer have been added to the case; both parties have attracted the most famous lawyers, including Queen's lawyer, Allan Meyers, and the best strippers.
Ms. De Lutís and her late wife, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s they managed milk bars and gastronomy, and in early 1970s they bought a shop in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a shop in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family store of gins.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last classes of the school, and Paul was then a boy (approximately 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis said that they were hoping to hand over their possession to the children without conflict with Louis, who died in 2012.
"Luiji often told me that she didn't want the brothers to understand in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group; Colina says that Mark received 10 million when he got out of business and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul and Luke, Mark and Mark were "unsatisfied with the financial conditions of their office".
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the Board of Directors of the AFL club and, according to Eddy McGira's 2015 biography, the best other star.
Fairfax Media was in contact with Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
He answered only Colin, a text message saying that since the case was not yet before the court, "I have the truth to say something special."
"I'm very sorry that my brother Paul decided to file a complaint against me and bring our family's name to trial," he wrote.
In mid - 2016, Colin wrote in evidence that he was trying to meet his brother’s requirements.
"Our father doesn't want to see Paul and me arguing in court," he said, adding, "there is still hope for a solution to the conflict."
On Friday, this hope seems to have spread.
"Our case will soon be decided by the court," Colin wrote.
The new head of the Trampa apparatus plans to limit the information to the President.
Others tried to do so and suffered defeat.
Maybe John F. Kelly's gonna make it.
In that case, he'll be the first.
"Politics" reports that the new head of the White House machine plans to limit the flow of information coming to President Trampo, including news from the media, hoping to keep the head in a calmer state.
That's what reporter Josh Dowzy reports.
"At the meeting, which was held by John F. Kelly's new head of White House with the lead of the camera on his first working day, he identified the main problem in the White House with President Donald Trampe, whom he hopes to resolve: bad channels of information to the President."
Kelly told the staff that information should be transmitted through it, in paper form or in briefings, because the President would be better able to make decisions if he received the correct information.
Kelly's diagnosis is absolutely true, but others have already failed in trying to reconcile the Trump by tracking his income.
The relationship between President Trampa and TV was a few decades ago, and now that he is in White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, was upset with the unfair lighting of the campaign, it was useful to demonstrate to him that he had received a fair light in the publications that could have been convinced," said Sam Nanberg, a former electoral adviser, in February.
Tara Palmeri then wrote in "Police," that "according to the six former members of the polling station to keep Tramp's habit of writing on Twitter, it was to be monitored that in the coming personal information, there was a constant stream of praise".
Okay.
But the idea that Tramp's habit of writing on Twitter was "under control" was just funny.
Perhaps these members of the polling station know something that we don't know, for example, that if they didn't, the Tramp tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about tweets that Trump didn't publish.
If his staff had saved him from trouble at least several times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has ever been able to stop the Trump from sinking oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda, giving the Trump material, whether reliable or not, that confirms their views.
"Politics" - just before this story - wrote in May about the advisors' willingness to constantly convey questionable information to the President.
Here is an example described by reporter Shein Goldmacher:
"The current and former staff members of Trump say that Trump can react very sharply to negative reports in the press, especially with dangerous leaks of information, and will not be relieved until he finds who was behind them.
This happened at the end of February, when someone put the president on the print of the GotNews.com article, the Web site of the promoter Charles K. Johnson, in which the vice-chairman of the Kathy Welsh machine was accused of being "suffering for a number of escapes" in the White House.
It is not important for Johnson to be permanently arrested on Twitter for his aggressive behavior, that he did not present specific facts, or that he committed false accusations in the past and then rejected them.
Trump read the article and agreed to ask staff about Welsh."
Goldmacher adds that then the head of the Rains Pribus apparatus and the secretary of the Rob Porter apparatus “tried to build a system to manage the flow of papers received by Trump and document them”.
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly's trying to do the same thing.
He may be a more efficient manager than Pribus, but Trampa still has an impulse, and his assistants continue to fight each other for influence.
These constant factors make the task of Kelly very difficult.
The Tumen Procurator ' s Office against HIV Dissident
The Prosecutor ' s Office challenged the Kalininian Tribunal of Tumeni, which ended the criminal case against a local resident whose daughter died of HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died because the mother was HIV-dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court dismissed her from responsibility for reconciliation with the injured father.
The Prosecutor ' s Office believes that the crime should not be left unpunished in order not to create a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case for the Tumeni resident was initiated at 1 p.m. 109 CFU (cause of insecurity death) in April after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV 4B infection.
According to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, the mother herself is HIV-infected.
"The woman did not treat herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that there was no HIV infection," explained at the Tumen District Prosecutor's Office.
The criminal case was brought before the Kalinin court of Tumeni, which ruled on its termination on 25 July.
An application was made by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that “he forgave a woman, had no claim to her, had done harm to her, and had apologized”.
The Prosecutor ' s Office, with the decision of the court, refused and appealed, demanding the annulment of the decision to terminate the case and re-examine it.
The girl died, and it's impossible to compensate for the crime of harm.
The HIV-infected mother, despite the advice of the doctor, refused to investigate and treat the child from a dangerous infection," reported the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
In the opinion of the supervisory authority, it should be punished, otherwise its example would be followed by other HIV dissidents.
According to the Tumen Centre for AIDS, about 12 children with HIV are now in the Tumen area without medical assistance due to the failure of parents.
“And this situation has already improved – during the year of the special group of half-parents who have categorically refused to treat children from HIV, changed their views – allowing them to carry out the diagnosis, become a drug dealer,” said the Press Secretary of the AIDS Centre Elena Loseva.
According to her, it was impossible for parents to be affected by legislation, and not all HIV-infected children were able to be found - mothers did not allow them to investigate, hide, and escape from hospitals.
What Is the Danger of HIV Dissidents?
At the end of last year, the peterburg sociologists presented the results of the first study in Russia of the so-called HIV dissident movement.
HIV dissidents call people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take drugs.
Doctors and AIDS-servicing NGOs call such views antidepressant and are in serious danger in their distribution.
The yellow photo session, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3, at the Greek Railway Station in Hmelnik.
The fun company of young people who were undergrowth walked by a bridge over the railways, where the freight train was just standing.
One of the friends had an idea to make an effective self on the wagon roof, reported FACTAM in the police communications sector in the Hmelnik area.
The guy began to get off the bridge on the train, but because of his lack of supervision, he got stuck behind the electric transmission line and got hit immediately.
Luckily, it became known to the station's dissipator who immediately called for "an emergency."
Prior to the arrival of the victim's doctor, they moved to a safe place and then hospitalized at the Hmelnik district hospital.
Men were diagnosed with fevers of 1 to 2 degrees.
His condition is now assessed as stable.
The lawmakers remind us that more and more people have recently acquired extreme self-reliance on multi-story roofs, bridges and transport.
The police call on people to be vigilant and not to allow such photos, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed the existence of oceans in ancient Venus
In the ancient Venus, there could be oceans.
The French scientists suggested this.
Experts have developed a computer model that has demonstrated the water education process on the surface of the planet, says Science News.
It was found that at the beginning of her history, the oceans had 10 per cent more water than they are now on Earth.
Previously, "Week Arguments" wrote that, according to scientists' hypothesis, the ocean could have existed on Mars 4 billion years ago.
Foreign experts in their studies concluded that the water object was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured as a result of the shooting in the park in San Francisco
Three people were injured in San Francisco as a result of the shooting, reported the Associated Press.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park, where a large number of visitors were present.
According to witnesses, several men on the bridge began shouting threats.
One of them pulled out a gun and started shooting at people.
The outside appearance of the wicked could not be considered, since they had been closed except for their eyes.
Another medical care was provided, after which he was released.
The third wounded is a minor, no details of his condition.
The Dolores Park hill is a popular place among locals and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were injured during the shooting at the night club in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several visitors were injured trying to leave the room.
Louna rock group will present a new album in Barnaule
The Louna Rock Group concert will take place in Barnaul on 17 October.
The musicians will present their new album "Wonderful New World", which has become one of the most anticipated religions of the year.
The collection prepares a conceptual show that will be the brightest in the group's concert history.
The "Wonderful New World" is the fourth album of the Russian rock band Louna.
His name is related to the famous Roman Anti-Utopia O. Haxley "The Strange New World".
The new songs do not cross the book, but they tell about a society that lives by anti-topia law, “the blind belief in propaganda and the imposed values”.
To collect the money for the album group, the audiences were helped: more than 1,200 people supported the project on Planeta.ru.
Its first album "Do Gromche!" was released in 2010.
Two years later, musicians presented the Time X album, and in 2013 they recorded the album "We are Louna" (2013).
In the autumn of 2015, the Louna group took a symphonic orchestra at Crocus City Hall with the song about the world.
As part of the Lusine Gevorkian group, Vitaly Demidenko (bas-guitar), Ruben Kazarian (guitar), Sergey Ponkratiev (guitar), Leonid Kinzburski (barabana).
The concert will be held at Pharaoh's Barnaul Club on 17 October at 19.00.
Ticket price: from 1200 to 2600 rubles.
Louna is one of the excavated groups on the Russian rock stage.
The collection was founded in 2008.
Their debut was held in 2009.
The team has won several prizes in various hit parade nominations of "Dear Virgin".
The gypsies have overcome the ravages and returned to the "Million Street"
Some of the most powerful mayors of the West Midlands are once again in conflict with the determined Roma who have overcome the vast municipal authorities to reoccupy the area near their homes.
The gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the rich street of Solihalla, which was called the Millionaire Street.
When they brought with them horses, infantry, and many homes on wheels, they returned after they had been driven out no longer than in May, and they had not been prevented by the rarities of the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a breach in the defence facilities and pushed its vehicles across a site that was left uninvited to leave a place for the fall.
The people who were exposed attacked the municipality of Solihalla, saying that he was “inability to solve this problem”.
An anonymous resident said, “They came here at night on Monday, after they had been driven from Bentley Hit, where they used to throw stones.”
The municipality should be ashamed and forced to act because they are totally unable to solve the problem.
The gypsies were here in May, they were chased, and here they are again.
Last night, more Gypsy arrived, and today, maybe more.
“The Birmingham Municipality knows how to solve this problem, they receive long-term judicial decisions to protect their parks,” she added.
I live on Street Brook Road, and I don't like the fact that I keep paying municipal taxes, and the municipality can't even put an end to this."
One of the local residents who wanted to remain anonymous said, “This is ridiculous, we just saw these gypsies go away the previous time, and this attack is going on, please.”
This time they were multiplied, and we saw on the side of the mountain a great multitude.
The representative of the Municipality of Solihalla said: “We know about the illegal camp on the ground near Street Brook Road and we are working with the Solihalla police; we are taking the necessary legal action to prosecute them as soon as possible.”
In order to help us collect the evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any anti-social or criminal conduct to the telephone 101 police.
This enables us to make an opinion on the situation that will be dealt with by the court when we present our case to them.
The "New World" champagne wine production is in operation.
The GUP of the Republic of Crimea “New World” is decided to take action by transforming the “New World” Spanish Wine Factory into the OAO, as directed by the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna Anuhina.
100% of the company's shares will remain in the property of Crimea.
The statutory capital of the shareholding company shall be 595.5 million rubs and shall consist of 5,955 million ordinary shares of a nominal value of 100 rubs each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea has stated that if there is no means to modernize the enterprise within the next three years, the plant will be at risk.
The amount of basic funds per enterprise is around 60-70 per cent.
The enterprise needs 1.2 billion rubles to be modernized, and due to the special features of the legal form, it is required to pay 50 per cent of its income in the budget.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"Getting money from the owner is a problem, talking about attracting loan funds from large credit organizations hard," said Crimea Sergei Petlin's headlines in April of this year.
The Crimean Parliament included the enterprise in the 2017 privatisation forecast plan.
It was proposed that it be held and displayed on the market.
The source of the Interfax in Crimea authorities assessed the potential value of sales of the company in $40 million, the investment of the investor in modernization, another $30 million.
The "New World" in 2016 increased the production of toys by 2.8 per cent compared to the 2015 level to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, the New World was about to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by the Prince of Lviv Golicin as a winemaking plant in the name of the New World acquired by him.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Lower-city third-class diggers have destroyed more than 40 graves
The FMH staff in the Lower Rural Area have identified the identity of the citizens who have destroyed 46 graves at the site of the city of Liskivo.
A third - grade student was a criminal.
The first statement that the burial sites were damaged by the unknown occurred in Russia ' s OMVD on the Liskov region on 27 June.
In this regard, 24 people have been contacted by the police.
As a result, a criminal case was initiated under article 244 of the FRF, “Distorting, damaging or desecrating burial sites”.
As a result of the investigation, the police found suspects, two students were 8 and 9 years of age.
Juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing the memory fall, and that led them to hooligan activities.
Preventive activities were carried out with children and their parents.
Italy is increasing its tone with regard to NGOs that are saving migrants.
Italy warned NGOs belonging to the Mediterranean rescue courts that they would not be able to continue their work unless they were subject to new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new Code of Conduct, it is difficult to say whether they can continue their activities," said Minister of Interior Mario Minniti in an interview with the Customs daily Stampa.
The warning issued by Minnity was the next day after the Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Retett, suspected that his crew was actually cooperating with human trafficking and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has been working all year, has rejected comments on the merits of the detailed charges brought against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrojo Cartozio.
"There is and will be a high priority for us to save human life, so we are very sorry that we cannot now continue our activities in the search and rescue zone," says an organization's statement in the neighbourhoods.
"We will be able to assess all the charges now made, only after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have followed the Juventa ship, belonging to Jugend Rettnet, since October.
Its crew is suspected that the entire lifeboats were taken on board by migrants who were sent directly to them by human traders and allowed smugglers to leave along with boats that they could use again.
At least one such meeting was expected to take place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, as stated in the evidence of the indictment published in Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the requirements of the Italian coastal authorities that control rescue operations in the area rather than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct assumes, in particular, that juvenile courts will be on board an Italian police officer who will monitor their activities.
While only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue operations agreed to submit to the Code: "Spasty Children", Maltese MOAS and "Pro-Activa Distant Entities" from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that the new rules were unnecessary, but acceptable, provided they would not lead to any "significant changes or confusion" in its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign are those who received the Nobel Prize for Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said that the sudden decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicated that efforts to support Libyan coastal protection and cooperation with local mayors bore fruit.
"In the last few days, we started to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He reported on the plans for further negotiations with the Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries hoping to reach Europe.
"In Libya we do not want to associate with any of the parties to the conflict"
The RF authorities have recently significantly stepped up their policies in the Libyan direction, and with visits to Moscow, delegations of the opposing Libyan parties have been involved.
The head of the Russian contact group on the internal settlement of the Middle East to the Middle East and Gosdom, the Assistant Head of the Czech Republic, Lev Dengov, told "U", what goals Moscow pursues in this region and to whom it pays a stake.
The contact group on Libya, which you lead, is almost unknown.
Let's say the contact group in Ukraine knows everything about her.
And here's the secret curtain.
What exactly do you do, what goals do you pursue?
The Contact Group was set up on the initiative of the FDI RF and the State Duma.
Its activities are run by Minister of Foreign Affairs Michael Bogdanov and Adam Delimhanov (Deputy of the Duma of Chechnya).
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the speaker of Mr. Viacheslav Volodin.
In September 2015, there were 11 people on board in the Russian tanker Mechanic Cebotarov in Libya.
We've been thinking about how to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military specialists, representatives of Gosduma, was established, supported by Chechnya Ramzan Kadirov.
How'd you get what you headed?
Since I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been asked to take the lead in the group.
Our activities were not limited to the release of the sailors from Mechanika Cebotareva.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all major groups opposed to each other in the Libyan conflict - and by Tripoli (where the recognized UN Government is based in the head of Faiz Saradzem. - "U") and Tobruk (a parliament that opposes the Government and supports Marshal Khalif Haftar, who controls the eastern regions of Libya. - "U").
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metiga (the Deputy Prime Minister of Libya, "U"), we were able to agree quickly on the release of Russian sailors.
It was then decided to make better use of these contacts, to establish a contact group.
Its objective is to analyse the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to associate with any of the parties to the conflict, we have a dialogue with everyone.
How many people are in the contact group, and how many of them are still in Libya?
There are now five people in the contact group.
Among them are people who have experience in force structures, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also wish to include a group of experts on the region, representatives of the Middle East Institute of RAN.
None of our staff are in Libya permanently, so far there is no need.
Are there Russian military advisers in Libya now, instructors?
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All the discussions and publications on this matter are not valid.
But your contact group has ex-military members...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or, until a certain time, the city is closed to us, such as Misurata (which is based on teams of militias that played a role in the conquest of Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi in 2011 and which have been significantly revitalized in the following years).
We arrived in Misurat in January of this year.
We were scared, they said it was all Islamist, terrorist.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, to analyze the real military potential that is responsible for why there are such rumors as are actually the role of Islamists.
In Missouri, we met with all the teams involved in the destruction of the IG in Sirte (in December 2016 the city on the Mediterranean coast was turned away from the soldiers banned in Russia by the Islamic State - the "U").
We wanted to see them, get to know these people, check that they played a crucial role in the destruction of the IG in Libya, not Khalif Haftar, who attributed himself to them.
And what is your conclusion?
The Islamic State in Libya won the Haftar?
That's not what he did.
Haftar conducted operations on another front in Benghazi.
And the IG in Sirte was fought by the structures that were in subjection to the Government in Tripoli.
And, in fact, we have invited people in Russia to this anti-terrorist operation.
And they came - the visit extended from 19 to 23 April of this year, and the Libyan delegation was adopted by the Council of the Federation, Duma, Mida and Rosgwardia.
You are, as we have understood, in all regions of the Libyan region and are likely to represent local elites and field commanders.
Do you think arrangements will be made for the ceasefire, for the elections reached at the end of July in Paris by Khalif Haftar and Faiz Saradz?
Or, again, as has been the case in the past, the agreements will be broken, the fighting will resume, the parties will try to take power together?
For us, the fact that Saradz and Haftar have agreed to a regular meeting has already become a good signal has not been possible for us as long as it has been possible.
In the recent past, both leaders have been extremely negative about each other.
And as for Russia's position...
They often write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe in it.
We faced this situation when they were in Missouri, and Haftar was on board the Russian Air Force Admiral Kuznezov that day.
It was a coincidence.
But they did not believe in Egypt at the same time.
They said to us, "You must be very brave people who have come to us today."
But our task is to show that we do not only support Haftar, but we engage with all key parties to the conflict in Libya.
You and Hafter have been together.
Does understanding with Russian partners at a human, emotional level facilitate the fact that he has been taught twice in the USSR?
So does Haftar know Russian?
He's Russian if he knows, it's very relative.
But what we learned, of course, facilitates dialogue with him.
And there's more to it than that.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Missouri, we meet the generals who have learned either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And here's what they're saying in Russian.
And they're moving to Russia, and they're experiencing some kind of nostalgia on it.
Do you consider the early abolition of the arms embargo imposed on Libya?
Are your Libyan allies interested in supplying Russian weapons?
They are interested, of course, but, as I have already said, we do not take sides in this conflict and would not want to arm each other to the detriment of each other.
We would like everyone to be around the same position.
With regard to the arms embargo, the Libyans constantly call for Russia to make its withdrawal.
Libya is now actively advancing its constitutional process.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise decisions, achieve internal consensus.
Then the elections must take place, as was the case at the meeting of Saradha and Hafar.
If the elections are held and a legitimate authority is finally elected (and none of the parties have such a status), the question of the withdrawal of the arms embargo may be raised in the UN sobez.
To raise this issue now illogically and dangerously will only result in an escalation of conflict.
During the media days, information was received that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees flying from Libya, felt abandoned by EU allies.
Can Moscow help Italian partners in this situation by using their relationship with the Libyans?
How far, for example, is it realistic that the Haftara teams will take control of the coast and put an end to the smuggling business of immigrants in Europe?
A very timely question.
We're working on it.
The Italians are in need of support from Russia because Moscow is engaged in dialogue with Hafate, with Saradze, and with Misuratah and with the south of the country.
In this regard, the tribes of southern Libya play a major role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it about the South to cross the flows of migrants on remote raids?
So, on the condition of speaking, were the return buses driven by Nigerian migrants?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these flows going.
We hope to enable the South to unite in the negotiation process between Saradzem, Hafter and the tribes in the south.
But for the first time, we would like to see the unity of views on this issue between Hafter and Saradzem.
The head of the Government in Tripoli, Faiz Saradj, is considered an Islamic, proponent of the introduction of Sharia.
How radical are his views?
Would this not be an obstacle to relations with Russia or the West?
I'll tell you my personal opinion of him.
In my opinion, he, on the contrary, is an opponent of radical Islam.
But Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself held the position that Libya should be a totally normal country, moderately Islamic, open-minded.
He is also actively fighting terrorists.
How does he have such a reputation?
It was created by those countries that were not interested in Russia being contacted by Tripoli.
Tripoli is a capital, there is legislative, executive and judicial authority.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other public structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in us not going there.
And we got them all mixed up and started talking to Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we're already reaping the results of this work: Rosnefte has concluded an agreement on cooperation with the State Oil Company of Libya - NOC.
Director NoC Mustafa Sanalla, with whom Rosnefti Igorj Sechin concluded the deal, directly from Tripoli.
Two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do to her?
I think I'm reselling.
And what other economic interests in Libya do Russia have?
In plans to sign contracts with Muammar Kaddafi.
In particular, the former agreements in the field of transport (railway construction), energy (electricization) and a number of others are concerned.
Do the lions have anything to pay?
Well, they have oil.
So, as with Iran, is this the oil exchange scheme?
I don't know what the scheme will be, I don't care about these issues directly.
Indeed, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main one.
We're actually doing a peacekeeping job there.
For us, the main thing is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans to agree with one another so that they can establish their own order and Libya has ceased to be an enabling environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task of helping the Libyan people and expeling terrorists from there.
Do you have any information on the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical fighters from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to clarify this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan Security Committee, who said that there is no exit from Russia and other countries of the former USSR to date.
He said that he had about 50,000 telephone records of Islamic and radical groups (in Libya. - "U") and the Russian word did not sound there.
What, then, are these warriors from which States?
I don't want to go into that detail.
Then we'll form the question differently.
How many of the Islamist fighters in Libya are the Libyans themselves?
There are virtually no Libyans, no more than 5% of them.
The others are coming.
Could Moscow conduct internal negotiations like Paris?
There are such plans.
We are actively negotiating with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and we have expressed our readiness to come to Moscow or to the Comoros.
When can such negotiations take place?
Now it's hard to say.
A few more visits have to be made, and I hope that the time and the place of the negotiations will be clear.
At the Czech Museum, the charity gathered money for a precious gift to a sick boy
A nine-year-old boy, Sasha McCola, who has DCP, brain hydrocephaly and complete blindness, will receive a special runway on 5 August.
The useful presentation will be given by Saše, Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region, Oxana Kosareva, and director of the Constantin Bobkov Museum.
The money for the coach was collected during the charity marathon "Don't Stop Doing Good", which took place in Melihova on July 15 on the day of the memory of the Czech Republic.
Recently, a marathon in the museum was received from Sashi, who lives in the village of Manuskino of the Czech Republic, and wrote, "I have no eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
"I'd really like to get a runway in a gift to make my legs strong, and I could hear how I learned to walk."
And here's Sachin's dream!
After being handed over to the museum, "Concert-postscriptum" will be a famous pianist who deserves to be a Russian artist, Alexander Gindin, to fill the gaps in popular classical productions.
During the charitable marathon in Melichov, the choirs of the Voznéschen David Desert, the bells of Master Ili Drozdihin, the students of the Moscow Conservatory of the name P.I. The Czech and Russian Academy of the Names of Gnesins, the artists of the Melichov Theatre of the Czech Studio.
An auction was held for visitors, a book fair and a charity sale of a souvenir product with a maraphan logo.
The Méliovo Museum Commander took the initiative to make the Memorial of the Czech Republic on 15 July a one-day charity in all the Museums of Podmoskovia.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevska Gítomir County, near the local football stadium, shot several times at the side of the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was upset by the noise, FACTAM reported in the communications department of the GI.
After that, the man went to a coffee shop nearby.
There was a conflict in the building, during which the man used a device to shoot the resin bullets, wounding one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old is provided with the necessary medical care and no threat to his life.
Police and emergency medical services arrived at the scene, but the shots were hidden by that time.
The law enforcement officers established his identity and detained him on the same day, August 2nd.
He couldn't explain his actions.
He's got a device to shoot the resin pulses that's been sent to the experiment.
According to this fact, criminal proceedings under article 296 (holiganity) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine have been initiated.
The detainee is threatened with imprisonment for 3 to 7 years.
Remember, a shooting attack occurred on 28 July in Kiev in the area of Tatarsky Street.
Penalties by Michel Carter for reports of the suicide of Conrad Roy
Massacuses was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for having committed suicide by means of text messages and telephone calls from her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michel Carter, who is now 20 years old, will have to spend 15 months at the end of the test period and another 5 years at the end of the test period.
Carter was found guilty of the unintended murder of Conrad Roy in June, which ended on 13 July 2014.
Father Roya said at the hearings on Thursday: "My family was killed in the heat.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free before the appeal.
She was threatened for a maximum period of 20 years, but her lawyers said that she and Roy had had mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red blouses and cream blouse, listened to the sentence standing, rubbing his hands and taking his eyes off.
"With her actions she killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor declared.
"She stopped his life to improve hers.
She didn't accept responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show any prejudice."
But lawyer Carter said it was "a tragic case that she deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that, in his view, her “age, age, or even mental illness did not significantly affect her actions”.
The prosecutor read Roy Lynn Roy's mother's statement, saying, "There's not been a day when I would not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I deal with him - I try to support his sister, despite all the pain that will remain with us forever," he says.
Sister Roy Camdin Roy said that she was constantly haunted by the thought that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become his child's aunt.
"The man who has always been with me since my birth is the pain that will remain with me for the rest of his life," she said.
This case would appear to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that would be responsible for the advice of a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roya was found in a car with symptoms of carbon dioxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case drew the attention of the whole country, when it was known that it was inspired by Carter's suicide.
"You can hang, hang out on the roof, hang yourself with a knife, I don't know a lot of ways," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death when he was breathing with his family.
In a few minutes before her suicide, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad" and "You just have to put on a fire, and you're gonna be free and happy."
Judge Monis said that Carter wanted to get attention through Roy's death and prohibited her from communicating with the press so that she could not get what she wanted.
The views of the lawyers on this matter have been divided.
One of the few who protected Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British neighbour in Italy two years later.
The 30-year-old Knox published his special opinion in Los Angeles Times, which stated: "Michel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Eugeni Boerchev: "I let Langford go like a high-flight bird."
One of the best basketball players in the UTB's 33-year-old Kit Langford League has left UNICS.
U.S. Secretary of State "Reports" commented on Mr. UNIX President Eugeni Bouchev.
China has taken this decision on family circumstances, told Eugenie Boschev.
He's got a little kid, a woman who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Kit wants to be closer to home.
I decided to go see him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played three seasons in UNIKS, and in each match he showed a high level, and he was 100%.
That's why I let him go like a high-flight bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and in his career.
Keith Langford played at the Danish club for three years, won the Silver One League 2015/16.
In the 2016/17 season, he won the most successful Eurolygia season.
He took 21.75 points on average for the match.
This result has been the second since 2004 when this prize was established.
Langford, who also won the prize in 2014, became the second player in the history of Eurolygia, who won the prize more than once.
In the near future, Langford will sign a contract with China's Shenjhen, informs Eurohops.
The American is expected to enter into a two-year contract of $5 million.
Langford will be the second in July of the Eurology Star that goes to the Chinese Championship.
Previously, the Chinese CBA was transferred to the ex-Central Panatinaicos, Jannis Burusis.
A sunburned tourist from Sub-Moscow evacuated by helicopter in Adige

Audi is expected to modify up to 850,000 diesel cars
The day before the announcement by Audi, BMW, stated that they would propose updating the software in more than 350,000 cars.
The President of BMW said that the company believed that “there were more intelligent ways than driving restrictions”, meaning European cities, including Munich, where BMW was available, which considered the possibility of prohibiting or limiting the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler said on Thursday that he modified the three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies called their steps a response.
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to facilitate compliance with carbon dioxide rules.
But nitrogen oxides that expel diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The value of equipment for automotive manufacturers, which also neutralizes diesel exhaust gases, is increasing and maintaining a competitive price for cars is becoming difficult.
While the German auto manufacturers were under close scrutiny, the Chancellor's Government, Angela Merkel, also charged that it was affecting the affected auto producers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
The companies are trying not to repeat the errors of Folkswagen, which have hidden the use of so-called "fighting devices" that, during the test, have been able to control the number of waste gases to comply with the rules and have been excluded under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several leaders of Folkswagen were convicted, and others were prosecuted on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics division was arrested in Germany as part of the Audi engine development group.
The former manager, Zacqueo Jovanni Pamio, an Italian, was therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought before a court in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was subject to a German criminal investigation involving Folkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of setting up a system to deal with European emission rules and extended the investigation previously concentrated in the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation may create serious problems for Folkswagen: the manufacturer of elite cars is a source of disproportionately high income for Folkswagen.
In Astrahani, a coffee visitor paid false money
The police received a report from the bank's staff on the discovery of the money from the company, a suspicious buyer with a denomination of 5,000 rubles.
A study conducted at the Expert Criminalist Centre showed that it was false.
As told by the UMVD of Russia in the Astrahan area, the banknote has been distributed to one of the coffee visitors who bought a shaurm.
It should be noted that the case was not equipped with a buyer's trueness device.
The police are currently setting up individuals involved in the manufacture and sale of a reportedly counterfeit CB FM ticket.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the IMF calls on the inhabitants of the Astrakhan area to be careful in the conduct of financial operations; trade facility workers are encouraged to establish tools to verify the authenticity of the money received.
Astronomers have found a "adequate" planet on which even iron can swim.
For the first time, when the stratosphere of the giant exoplanet called WASP-121b was studied, astrophysics were very surprised by its temperature, which was able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts have pointed out that the water molecules are so light-enhanced that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble Telescope has sealed the light of the water molecule on this gas giant: it's a high temperature that causes the world's atmosphere to shine in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called hot yuppers, which are gas giants, in size and mass comparable to the largest planet of the Solar System, but located ten times closer to the parental star.
This year, only 1.3 "earth" days will last on the esophagus, and its gas envelope is nearly 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit [2,500 ° C].
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and South France, but now there are fears that climate change is threatening it.
Lavanda has become worse because of drought and infectious diseases; this has caused constant pain to scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert from the Provence Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM, said: “Lawanda in Provence is indeed at risk because in recent years this plant has experienced the effects of climate change: the spring and especially the autumn of rain has become much less.
This affects the lives of the lavender.
And there's some little cicadas that pull on the leaves of insects that carry microbacterials; they're going to get a lot of dry weather."
There's a lot on the map.
Lavanda not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is very excited about perfume and cosmetology.
Eric Shes says, "Instead of very long sleeves with a large number of large colors, we have small, undeveloped, weakened or not at all.
Therefore, we have fewer parts of the oil."
The decisions currently under consideration include improving the distribution of water and slowing the evaporation from soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and extraction of more dry varieties.
Ambassador of the Winter University 2019 met with the Royal Schoolers
The two-time hockey world champion, Ambassador of Winter University 2019, Alexander Semin met early with starters of hockey and gave autographs to patients.
The meeting took place at the Winter University in 2019 as part of a thematic week about shark hockey.
Any visitor of the tent could wander at the ends of the artificial ice field.
In addition, stadiums, victors and games with the play of the sovereign production of student games have been organized, displacing the aerobics federation.
50 students attended the event.
Alexander Semin advised the boys as much as possible to engage in sports and stressed that the most important thing in the early stages of education was a diligent work and a strong desire to engage in hockey.
"Hello, there's such a place in Krasnoyarsk as the winter-universidad camp in 2019, where starters can directly ask questions to team trainers," said the champion.
It is noted that promoting student sport and healthy lifestyle among redbirds helps the Ambassadors of the Winter University of 1919.
The University Shatter will work throughout the summer season until 25 September, reports the Winter University 2019 press service.
Ms. Medvedev commented
The official representative of the U.S. Mr. Hizer Nawert, commenting on the briefing by Prime Minister Dmitria Medvedev, said that there was a need to find a "area for interaction" with Russia.
According to her, such areas should be found to “improve bilateral interaction”.
As an example of such successful cooperation, Nawart called the peace agreement on Syria.
We're two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work together," the diplomat said.
However, Nawart refused to comment on Medvedev ' s claim of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia has said that, she has, of course, the right to speak, but more on this subject I can't say anything," said the representative of Mr.
Former U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill to strengthen sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new sanctions package, the Head of Government of the RF Medvedev said that Washington had declared Moscow a full-fledged trade war, with the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Bears also stated that US sanctions would be effective for decades.
In addition, he considered the Prime Minister, the U.S. “pure Play” Trampa.
Lost in Sub-Moscian bodibuilder found another lost memory
Bodibuilder Shamil Hanmetov went down the road in Noginsk on 25 July under very picky conditions: he came out of the car room to go to the bathroom.
Seven days failed to find the well - known and local residents.
And Shamil was found on a foreign daughter in Ramenski.
He was found naked in his own bathroom.
The Dutch sportsman couldn't explain how it happened here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name, and the passport was gone.
Identifying the identity has helped the announcements about his disappearance.
The doctors who came out of the hospital recorded a partial memory loss and brain damage in Hanmetov, reports the Mash.
Perhaps sportsmen are waiting for other surprises.
The criminals who kidnapped Shamil may have already been in his apartment, the keys from which he also had the keys.
Oil gas revenues exceeded the forecast of 7.4 billion rubles in July
As a result of July 2017, oil revenues were actually overestimated by 7.4 billion rubs, reports the Ministry of Finance of the RF.
The excess, as explained by the department, was mainly due to a higher exchange rate of the United States dollar compared to the average monthly value of June used for the assessment, as well as due to an increase in the actual production of gas and the export volume of oil products at the projected levels.
"The deduction of the federal budget revenue from the monthly assessment under the Federal Law on the Federal Budget for 2017-2019 is projected in August 2017 at +40.2 billion rubs," said Minfin.
Thus, the total amount of money allocated to the purchase of foreign currency in the domestic currency between 7 August and 6 September 2017 is 47.6 billion rubs.
Accordingly, the daily purchase of foreign currency is equivalent to 2.07 billion rubs.
The Bank of Russia will be attracted to foreign exchange purchases by Minfin Russia.
Each working day during that period, the CB will conclude foreign exchange purchases at organized trades of the Moscow Stock Exchange equally during the trading day.
The acquired foreign currency will be included in the Federal Treasury account at the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes that Mexico is becoming more and more dangerous.
Officials of the Riyadh weekly newspaper usually meet in the media to discuss plans to highlight recent violent crimes in Sinaloa, related to organized crime, corruption of officials or the continuing war on drugs.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they have met to talk about security.
They were told that they should change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking children with them to the office, where they had already released the grenade in 2009, or leaving their home.
The security experts wrote three words: enemies, neutrals, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column - no evidence needed, suspicions and internal feelings would be sufficient.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who suspect that they are being held by the Government or the cartels, a whole list of supporters, which makes the work of lighting chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence does not give way, and among the troops that are multiplying in the country, more and more journalists: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, not less than 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took his position in December 2012; 589 people are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and at least seven people have died in seven states this year.
Among the last was their publisher and inspiration, founder of Rios, Javier Valdes Cardenas.
"The only big mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Waldes wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violent crimes.
His absence is very acute, although his presence is everywhere -- a large photo of Valdes showing the middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" hanging on the facade of the Rios building; two reporters for 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry the football on which his smile, face in the eyes or his corporate panama was shown.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, the insomnia, and the paranoia.
Although the Office of the Special Prosecutor for the Investigation of Journalist Cases was organized in 2010, only two cases were investigated according to the Journalist Protection Committee.
As with most of the crimes committed every year, thousands of drug-trafficking and organized crime are rarely reported by journalists.
Journalists of Rios insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are killed in the heat, even though they are now much more dangerous.
Without information about the killers, without justice from the security talks at the meetings, Ibarra said.
"It's very foolish to spend time at this seminar," he says.
"Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone."
On 15 May, Valdes left the riodos office in the capital of Kuliacan.
He managed only a few quarters before his red Toyota King was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times in it, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "Twelve River".
The shooter went to his car and smashed it near.
Valdes was 50 years old.
He had a wife and two adult children.
Listeners usually go fast on Kuliakana.
But it's almost all about Valdes.
Since Guzman was arrested and released in the United States in January last year, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, as rival factions fight to fill the educated vacuum.
We will not talk about killing one or several people every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the tomb is filled with beautiful two-storey drug dealers, who are more than the home of many living people.
Let's just forget for a minute that the state of "calmness" is just when one of the cartels takes over the maritime state with important ports and ways of drug trafficking in the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdes was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ishmael Bohorques, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Rios, was overwhelmed by the guilt that he could not protect another.
He thinks two mistakes have helped the murder.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damas Lopez, a leader of the rival cartel factions, who fights with the sons of Guzman.
The publication could upset the boys; people who were supposed to be members of the gang gathered all copies of the publications as soon as they were delivered to the kiosk.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdes to leave the country for his own safety after the other newspaper that wrote about the same story was seized.
Valdes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as a regular milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He was so far away from danger, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter in Noroeste, and in 2003, together with five colleagues, he founded Rios, sold his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to deal with journalism without affecting the subject of drugs," Bohorques said.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest publishing, sales, and advertising revenue.
Journalists were pleased that they could publish bold reports, not afraid of censorship, but attracted readers to what they could read in this publication about what no one else dared to write.
Eight years after her foundation, Rios received Maria Murs Cabo's prestigious award for her work as a reporter in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdes won the International Press Freedom Prize for Courage in an investigation of Mexico's drug trafficking wherever it went.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the CPJ award.
The drug trade in Sinaloa is "this form of life," he said in October last year in an interview with Rompevinto TV.
"You've got to take the jobs that you're dealing with as a journalist, or you're just being a fool."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths... why didn't you say what was happening?"
The staff of the Rios misses Valdes, a shoemaker who prayed as a trucker in the port, the other one, generous in the embraces and advice, a teacher who knew how to fit in the living.
They relied on their own order.
He was always supposed to wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, a bar opposite the office, and always sit there with the same chair.
Now they're asking, "Did he lose his love for the unity of the established order?
His death led them to doubt and wonder about how best to do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you understand their wives, their children, their legal business and their underground drug transport airports.
"These things were a hell of a thing," said Bohorkes.
As a result, even in the best of times, self-esteem and self-esteem were high.
We need to trust our instincts.
Stay away from the bad smell.
The problem, says editor Andres Villareal, is that "survey can be deceived... and then what happens to Javier."
The old rules, he and others, no longer operate in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mixture of profitable smuggling routes, weak government institutions and corrupt officials.
Landshaft is constantly changing.
In a room where Riodose staff gathered for security training, the second time it was prohibited to make hundreds of phones: a few days earlier, it was known that spy programs sold exclusively to Governments were used in Mexico for reports by journalists and public activists.
Two police officers are hiding in the shade of a 104-degree fire (40 degrees Celsius).
They were assigned by the Government to protect the Rios office, which is located in a four-storey building in the Burgundy district of Kuliacan.
Some reporters asked whether these police officers were among the 50 per cent of the officials in the order that the governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area that was de facto under the control of drug dealers.
In the next issue, Rios had three main themes.
It's a murder in Sinaloa's brother's former boxing champion Julio Sezar Chavez.
They still had government expenditures concentrated in the Governor ' s hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of the most expensive Kuliacan restaurants in the district of the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who had been abducted or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when the time came to write that everyone in the city knew that it was a favorite restaurant while the drug dealers and authorities were at the same time.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered for the policy of the ruling institutional-revolutionary party (PRI), which dominated at all levels of power during the almost all of the century.
A recent wave of corruption charges against several PRI governors has been filed.
William asked journalists to write about the previous incidents in this restaurant, including when the son of El Chapo Hasman rushed from the military.
A few months ago, readers would have been looking for the Valdes column with the most reliable information on kidnapping.
"We'd already know what happened," says 46-year-old Villareal, for his crafty body called El Flaco.
"Today all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The Waldenses office is now being used as a platform for posters and stickers with protests against the killings of journalists, because officials have become what they have never thought to be: activists on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went to the local prosecutor's office for the next morning.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoacan in the west three days after Valdes was killed.
They found a burnt body, and the authorities said it was based on DNA tests.
Journalists all over the country began to speak louder, to organize protests and to write SOS Press on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
The director of Bohorques was in Washington on that day, trying to seek international support in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the next day after the murder of Valdes Ramirez, the authorities accused them of spying on journalists and ordering them to be killed for telling the truth.
After that, she asked her not to give her any further tasks to highlight the Government ' s activities, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdes said many times that journalists in Mexico were "circumcised" by organized crime, its partners in the Government and the various society.
In his last book, Narco-Journalist, he wrote that reporters were killing not just gangs of drug dealers; they did so by order of security policies and services in connection with organized crime.
The Articulum 19 press committee believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were made by police and government officials.
"You die in Mexico because they want to shut you up," says Ramirez.
Of course, killings scare people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Massias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
On her body, they found a note that was supposed to be written by the person of the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and earrings lay next to her cut head.
Some publications have chosen to close as El Norte's newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after her correspondent Miroslav Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to be "El Manjana" from Nuevo Laredo after her leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Huarez made a public call to drug cartels using the editorial article on the first page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their homeland or even their country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they continue to see the danger on the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as it is obvious, with a photographer by Ruben Espinoz, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in a Mexican apartment three months after her escape from Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work balance between risk decisions on a daily basis.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a poet, admits that he was afraid to write about drug trafficking.
"Mexica's sick in hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready for the press, the riodoses were sitting on the sidewalk next to the office and drinking beer when their phones called at the same time.
The series of shootings between opposing gangs and security forces was left behind by 19 troops, according to confirmed data, near the resort city of Masatlan.
The war continued to burn as promised in a series of cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they put news on the Rios website on the mobile phone.
The next day, the first page had to be translated.
The sirens were soon called - another shot in the circles.
Bohorques has seen if their security officers are ready to defend them.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Sitting under the huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was exposed to the entire Sinaloa, the Rios staff continued his work.
"How can you think about closing up?" said Bohorkes, "if on the same day that Javier was killed, the practitioner asked me to send her on the street to report?"
Dinozar used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, he appears to be a statue, even a horrendous horror.
The researchers said that the first remains of an incredible substance in the size of a rhino found by a Canadian camper remained so well that experts called it “Mona Lisa among dinosaurs”.
It was so well preserved that they could even determine that the color of his curly skin was red and brown, and to say that he had, in some way, “the dark past”.
The report, published in the journal Modern Biology, described it as “the very good preserved in Tyreofor for all the history of inventions and one of the best specimens of dinosaurs in the world”.
It is a recently discovered specimen of nodozavra living in the middle of the lightning period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good condition has disturbed researchers who call him “very remarkable”.
This grassy tireophorus is the most well - preserved dignitary species in the history of inventions, according to articles in the National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Sean Fancom when he worked at the Millenium mine of Sancor near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He focused on something that seemed to be different from the environment, and he decided to take a closer look.
Their discovery was sent to the Royal Tyrellov Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, the discovery of an animal within the ground depth of 2,500 feet (1,100 kg) was done.
Now that all this hard work is done, the final outcome can be demonstrated.
“It’s only easy to get bored, and you can almost believe he’s asleep,” said the leading author Caleb Brown, a scientific officer of the Royal Tyrellian Paleontological Museum, where he was established.
"He will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well preserved specimens of dinosaurs -- Mona Lisa among dinosaurs."
While studying his skin, the researchers discovered that it was grassy, although it was covered with panciers and recalled a walking tank, it was apparently exposed to a significant danger from floating dinosaurs.
This powerful brushed dinosaur used a red-and-white camouflage to hide from predators and used a protective technique known as a protective decoration, which many animals today also enjoy.
This would enable him to communicate more quickly with the environment and avoid encounters with the enemy, experts say, assuming that he was caught by larger dinosaurs.
This was a significant age in 110 million years, relating to the family of nodozavs, and was now on display in the Royal Tyrellian Paleontological Museum in May.
Scholars have already studied the animal and named him Boraleopelta markmitcheli as a museum lab by Mark Mitchell, a member of the group who spent more than 7,000 hours in the excavation.
The remarkable preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and the international group of scholars to document the drawing and shape of the hammers and armored plates on his body.
They found a protective decoration, a widespread method of protection in the kingdom of animals, which means that the upper substance was darker than his lower side.
Although the protective edge is well spread, the opening has become unexpected, because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is significantly higher than the size of the living animals with the protective edge.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur has been so actively hunted by humid dinosaurs that evolution has preferred to mask confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the modern animals with protective decorations, such as wool, silk or bronze, are much smaller and are more available, indicating that nodozav has had to fight hard for survival.
“A serious threat from predators to a massive, powerful dinosaur pancier shows how dangerous the Melovian dinosaurs were,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the cherries of the dinosaur also indicates that its skin should have been red and brown.
Students continue to study the animal, looking for life information, including the contents of its food tract, to find out that it was in its last trapeze.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was taken into the sea, where he slammed and turned his back down the bottom of the ocean.
At the time, it was as warm in Alberta as it was in South Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely spread far deeper into the drought than it is now.
“This nodozav is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with the preserved garlic skin, and at the same time it is completely preserved in three dimensions, preserving the original animal form,” Brown said.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it was then in Ranjem’s melo period.
There is no particular need to resort to imagination in order to re-establish it, it is only to be easily shaken, and it is practically possible to believe that it is asleep.”
It is a time when giant theorists, floating dinosaurs, standing on two feet, sailed across the earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the tyrant of Rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, one of his terrible ancestors could hunt down the thyroid.
These include acrocantosaver, a 38-foot (11.5 m)-weight monster in six tons.
Scholars whose latest discoveries are published in the journal Modern Biology believe that Borealopelta was introduced into the sea after death and mummified into the island.
The substance was found by Sean Fancom when he worked on the Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to museum staff, this is the most well-maintained tyreofor in the world, along with skin and pancire, and it is the goal, from the sea to the bone.
On average, they reached about 18 feet (five m) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
They were characterized by two twenty-first-year-old shrapnels speaking from shoulders.
The researchers believe that this grassy tireophorus has been hard at the time that it is now Canada until it is brought into the open sea.
But the underwater burying of the dinosaur kept his pancreas accurate to the smallest detail.
The stone remains of this particular specimen were so well preserved that the remains of the skin are still covered by bungrist pansy plates along the dinosava skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in an article for the National Geographic magazine, such a degree of conservation is “rare as you win the lottery”.
The longer I look at it, the more devastating it seems.
Residues of the skin are still covered by bungrist pansy plates that absorb the animal’s skull.
His right front leg is stretched out along the side, five fingers on it are thrown up.
I can count the candles on his desk."
Michael Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Michael Saakashvili, the former leader of Georgia, and then the Odesh region of Ukraine, flew to Poland.
In doing so, he did so without having documents confirming his identity and nationality.
About the arrival of Saakashvili, a Polish publication by Telewizja Republica, posted on its channel on YouTube with its presentation.
Saakashvili took part in an event in honour of the anniversary of Warsaw's Resurrection against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Because the politician did not know Polish, even though he tried to start speaking in that language, he had to speak English through the Polish translator.
In his speech, the policy focused on Georgia ' s cooperation with Poland and on Ukraine.
The fact that Ukraine's immigration service has withdrawn its citizenship, the policy has been undermined by the U.S.
He was able to complete a transatlantic crossing without documents until he knew it.
Former Governor of the Odessa Region, Michael Saakashvili, stated that his subscription to the poll to obtain Ukrainian citizenship had been submitted.
The politician stressed that he had not filled out any polls.
The investigation period in the case of Winziher and Olhovik extended until January
The deadline for the preliminary investigation into the acquisition of the Renova group of Evgenia Olhovik and the energy-holing head of the "T Plus" Boris Weinziher has been extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Basman Court examined the question of the extension of the alleged domestic arrest.
The representative of the SC at the meeting reported on the decision to extend the preliminary investigation for the last time.
“The particular complexity and length of the investigation is due to the need for the removal and expertise of a large number of documents, as well as the carrying out of investigation activities in the territory of several RF entities,” the investigator said.
He added that the suspects had been regularly taken over by the Commission.
Their total size is estimated at least billions of rubles.
According to the investigation, Winziher, Olhovik, as well as former CEO of the ZAO, Michael Slobodin, who led the company Vimpelk until 5 September, handed over to the senior officials of the Republic of the Commission a levy for setting the most favourable tariffs for heat and electricity, as well as for creating favourable business conditions.
Weinziher and Olhovik were detained, staged in Síttivkar and arrested for two months, Freedom hid from the investigation and was declared a federal investigation.
How did one activist know the answer to the question “Who are the streets?”
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to the depths of the soul.
Just the day after arriving in New York during a tourist trip, St. Louis was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented by Airbnb, watching a Facebook tape on the phone.
She got into someone's high school position.
It was said, “The police have just killed an eighteenth-year-old, and he is still in the middle of the street.”
Noting that no one else in the tape had borrowed this information, she closed the Facebook and opened the Twitter.
She had a lot of user moves with no @TheePharoah.
The Raper of the Great St. Louis, in real time, has featured Michael Brown's death on Twitter, the unarmed black-headed eighteen-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photo of Brown's lifeless body, scattered across the street, where it will be located for four hours.
"It's a savage," thought Ferrell.
But death was nothing new to her and her circle.
She postponed the phone, and later in the evening, she went back to the tweets that people are gathering on the Kenfield drive.
There were photographs of a tape and shouting people and people claiming that he was Brown's father who was crying, saying, "The Ferguson police officer just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a direct broadcast as a police officer standing in front of a group of protestants with a loathsome dog.
On another video, another police officer said, "I will kill you all, animals."
“This is a non-standard situation,” Ferrell said.
"This is not a murder like the ones we used to and we can call typical.
At that point, I felt a shame.
I was angry and cried.
She took the ticket back and flew home the next day.
When she landed at 11 p.m., she took her six - year - old daughter out of her father’s house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next almost three years has become the theme of the new documentary “Who Are the Streets?”, which will be screened on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and endurance in terms of people living in the community and filling the streets, requiring answers.
While Ferrell was walking to Ferguson with his daughter, dressed in a dress in flowers and flowers, they remembered the conversation that preceded this morning a countless number of times, “about the experiences of blacks and their situation”.
She remembers saying, "Do you remember what I told you about the fact that black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson now because a cop killed an 18-year-old boy, and that was wrong."
"I couldn't take it," said Ferrell later.
“What is happening today is the culmination of... what happened earlier.
She needs to know about it, see it, and wake up at it.
It should not only be well understood in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of experience of blacks and their provisions, and what we need to do to be free to be free.
Even if I can provide her with an environment in which she is not personally confronted with obvious racism, she is nothing different from any other black girl.
I feel like I'd do her a bad favor if I bought her out of it."
When they arrived in Ferguson, they first stopped at South Florissant Road, on a site located across the road from the police station, which was kind of a palace camp, while the activists were waiting for reports of officer Darren Wilson's indictment.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined the local entrepreneur who prepared the chain package.
They collected packages and helped to distribute them to the protestors.
A little bit in Ferrell's mind, he took the form of a new type of activism.
“My activism changed completely after 9 August”, she said, noting that she was a student of the University of Missouri-St. Louis, a president of the Association of Sanitary Students, representatives of national minorities, and dealt with food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
“I had no experience with the organizer.
That's all that's happening."
A few weeks later, at the evening demonstration Ferrell met Saba Foleyan, one of his directors.
Folian said that she and her main operator Lucas Alvarado-Ferrer “just wanted to document” events.
Ferrell came up with the question, "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story you can play with?"
This skepticism has been used by many, often white people, who have come to the community to benefit from its pain and endurance.
As Folian explained in a recent interview, “We have heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson are not at the center of attention, and they want to do so otherwise”.
Folian has already joined his director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on the subject of the death penalty.
His participation sparked sympathy for the Ferrell project and six other locals, with whom the "Who Streets?" project team maintained the connection over the years after Brown was murdered.
"In this documentary, no one's talking about us or us, that's what we're talking about," said Davis.
"That was the most important thing for me, as these people will be represented, because that's how I'll be represented."
Although the aim of the project was not to focus on Ferrell's experience, in an effort to show that the movement “is not about the leader, but about how the community is united”, Folian said it was the most open part of the film.
As a result, the “Who Are the Streets” showed unexpected personal aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrell, laughing at the way she first saw the ready product.
“But I understood that when you do this and humanize black people, there must be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, the story of Ferrell again discusses and highlights the role of a black homosexual woman in the broader context of the Black Life Movement.
Two of the three movement founders -- those who created the #BlackLivesMatter tag in social networks after the murder of the black girl Travon Martin in 2012 -- are hooked up with homosexuals.
“Black homosexual women in the leadership are supporting all this movement,” said Ferrell. “And all because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden."
Folian agreed with this claim, noting that “the movement is actually supported by black women and by a number of homosexual black women”.
However, she insisted that “this is not a case of positive discrimination”, and that Ferrell had not been selected by the central character of the film because of its distinctive features.
"She was the man who generated this energy," she said.
"On the other hand, it's not the coincidence that it happened first, because when"
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, Ferguson has been missing a cinema camera for a long time, but there are still complex racial ties between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be on trial for the end of the show for two and a half years.
She describes the social and political atmosphere of the place, which she calls home, simply "Bardak".
She's still holding on to the word she learned when she went out on Ferguson's street three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
"There is nothing but our feet to lose."
Two Salvadoran footballers were disqualified for the taste of US players
The footballers of El Salvador Henry Romero and Darwin Seren received long disqualifications for non-sport behavior.
During the fourth final match of the Golden Cup of the North and Central American Football Confederations and the Caribbean (CONCAF) the Salvadorans tasted American players.
The first was the defender Henry Romero.
The Salvadoran bites the attacker, Josie Altidore, and then he's stuck in his chest.
Then, at the time of the injection of the coal in his field, the defendant of the U.S. defense, Omar Gonzalez, was bitten.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches and Seren for six.
The meeting itself ended with an American win of 2:0, according to Goal.com.
Likening: an artist creates portraits with the help of DNA Chelsea Manning
At the center of the hall in Galleries Friedman in New York, people are smeared by white, black and brown, and everything is inseparable like each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Hiser Dewey-Harborg from the hair-skinted and hair-skinned masks sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent a copy from Fort Levenwart prison, where a former intelligence analyst is running a 35-year term for a well-known transmission of confidential diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called "Introduction of the Similarity".
This is the result of a two-year census between Dui Harborg, whose art unites technology, information and art, and Manning, a female transgender and a famous dissident, whom Barack Obama had mitigated the sentence only three days before the end of his presidency.
By analysing and using a computer DNA programme from Manning to create three-dimensional portraits of people who could have such a genome, Dewey Harborg created a deep, though difficult to perceive, not only the plasticity of DNA, but also the concept of their interpretation and the inherent definition of these interpretations.
Manning, born Bradley Edward, but since she was a teenager, openly said that she considered herself a woman, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the Act of Spyship, computer fraud and theft.
Her photographs were not available in prison, so only one of her photographs was known: a black-and-white self, where Manning in a platinum pot, apparently feeling uncomfortable, sat behind the wheel of the car; with that picture, she began to associate.
In 2015, Dewey Harborg successfully completed her 2012 project "Visiting the Unknown".
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people by means of judicial evidence of the type of circuses and the purple cut, distributing DNA from this garbage and creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They took an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article," explained Dewey Hagborg in a preliminary presentation for the press.
At the time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted a portrait of her DNA.
Thus, the artist and her prisoners in the museum became friends in writing and exchanged several letters over a period of two years.
They even wrote a comic book entitled "Repressed Pictures", illustrated by Sholey Kanungo, who illustrated how the future president would ease Chelsea's punishment and be able to visit the exhibition in person.
What Obama really decided to release Manning just a few days after the book went out in the light was a pleasant surprise after seven difficult years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something deep and strong and that the exhibition is opening right now, when Donald Trump announces the war on people who reveal secret information in the Government, and invents new ways of burning on Twitter the enemy he is supposed to mitigate.
When Dewey Harborg was asked about the coincidence of all this over time, she said, "there's nothing wrong."
In an artist's statement written on the wall of the gallery, the huge signature of Manning below (with a heart over "i" in her name) calls for the end of "automatic separation based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture".
On the opposite side, its mitochondrial DNA, a long goose from C, G, and A.
In addition to 200 letters (or nucleotides, as a scientificly researched artist) Dewey Harborg hoped to show what we all looked like, in any case, on his biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how much genetic data is open for interpretation and how much subjective it is," said Dewey Harborg; her 2007 video "False Memories" is also shown here.
"DNA can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories here."
The last part of the exhibition in one room is the novel mentioned above in the comic book.
It features King Kong Manning over the U.S. Correctional Building with a loudspeaker in hand.
"If they kill your word, they will win," it's written.
"So never shut up."
"This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me," said the artist, welcoming us from Philadelphia.
"I've still got some skin ants when I'm talking about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - as it was shown in comics - but when she comes, she will be welcomed by masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulations, gathered like a mob of protestors.
This is also intended to be done as well as all at the exhibition up to the height (5"2, increase Manning), where the karandas were drawn by genetic ganglogroups.
"I'd have hung them on the walls before, but now I'd like them to look like a bunch of people," says Dewey-Harborg about the portraits.
"I wanted them to be like the mass movement that formed around Chelsea, like the movement that stood for her release."
Professor North West University and Oxford University Officer are investigating the murder charge police
According to the police, there is a national area for Professor North-West University and Officer of Oxford University, who are being investigated as suspects because a dead man was found in Chicago's luxury room.
According to the reports of the Cook District Court, orders were issued on Monday to detain the intentional murder without the right to be released under the pledge of forty-two-year-old Windem Latema and Andrew Warren for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton Mr. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, the twenty-six-year-old Cornell Duranlo died after he was injured by multiple knee wounds.
A warning issued by the Chicago police station said that the body had been found on 27 July.
The police called, they came to the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found a victim with several wounds on the body.
According to officials, Cornell Duranlo was declared dead at the scene of the crime, and now the detectives are investigating the death of knife wounds, considering her murder, while the police are actively investigating two suspects.
Latam held the position of Deputy Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at the North West University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbag, vice-president of the University of Communications, reported in an e-mail statement that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was forbidden to enter the campuses of the North West University.
“It is now a criminal case that the authorities are investigating, and the North West University is working with the consequences,” Kabbag said.
Warren is the senior financial officer of Oxford University.
The representative of the University and Somerville College reported in an e-mail statement: “We have contacted the UK police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to US investigative authorities”.
The statement also stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give up.
The Chief of Police Liaison, Chicago Anthony Gulelli, said that he strongly advises the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have assumptions about their location, but our attempts to find them are increasing,” Gulelmy said.
According to Gulemi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping to find suspects.
According to Gulelli, the police called the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who just received a secret message that something happened in number 1008.
The police called the crime scene terrible.
Gulemi reported that it was unclear whether the incident had occurred on 27 July.
According to him, video camera data confirms that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latema and the victim had relations,” Gulelmi said.
The Grand Plaza Guide has issued a call to the residents saying: “The police are currently working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of reasons, including possible home occurrence”.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the WADA road map soon"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Opinion Agency (WADA) set for the resumption of the Russian Anti-Opinion Agency (RUSADA) would be fulfilled in the near future.
“The specified phase of compliance was completed, and RUSADA was allowed to plan and carry out tests together with ICAD (the UK Anti-Doping Agency).
The VADA road map was updated accordingly," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map to restore compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for resumption of the work of RUSADA and has recently been published on the website of the organization.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could present difficulties for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
The results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA soon," he added.
However, one of the requirements contained in the list implies that the Russian Andiping Structures should publicly recognize the results of the Canadian lawyer Richard McClaren's investigation under the ADA order, which claimed that the Russian sport doping was controlled by the State.
With regard to this issue, Mutko said: "We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures were taken.
But there was no host program, and we won't admit what was not there."
Mutko reiterated the words of Vitalia Smirnova, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Fraud Commission.
On the same day, in an interview with the Russian edition of Rsport Smirnov, he recognized the problems that had occurred in the Russian anti-dumping structures, but added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and situations.
No one is going to accept this report," Smirnov added.
WADA removed RUSADA from doping control in November 2015 following the doping scandal.
However, in June this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate the monitoring of international experts and the British Anti-dumping Agency (UKAD).
After visiting the organization's Moscow office in July, Director General of WADA Olivie Nigglia stated that RUSADA was " moving in the right direction" to restore its work.
A burning fire in the 79th floor of Dubai
The great fire that took place in one of the tallest residential buildings of the world, The Torch, is being carried over by Reuters.
It is noted that the fire has been able to cope with all the fires by 4.00 per local time (3.00 msec).
Local authorities reported that no one had been injured as a result of the incident.
During the fire, the streets of the skyscraper were closed.
The reasons for this are unknown.
The Torch, which is one of the highest buildings in the world, has been reported to have burned 79-bedded residential skyscrapers in Dubai.
All the tenants were evacuated on time.
Immaculate Order of the Bose Shrews: Necklaces
The scandalous leading reality show "Dom-2" by Olga Buzza hit the spectators of the Europa Plus Live dance festival in the rabbits.
In the eyes of thousands of worshipers, a newly introduced song with a duet with Nastey Kudri filled out the song "We'll be hot."
Both girls went to the stage in the provocative "brucks" so that the lower white singers appeared.
The signs of Buzova and Kudry were made on the bridges.
Earlier, it was reported that a specialist in a Moscow plastic surgery clinic commented on changes in the appearance of Busovov.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of NATO-Russia relations
On Friday, 4 August, Radio 4 reported on this with a reference to foreign media.
According to him, the Russian authorities were responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO's gender has also criticised Russia for the situation with Crimea and "destabilisation in eastern Ukraine".
However, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia was possible and that the further escalation of the situation would not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, President of the United States, Donald Trump said that the relationship between the United States and Russia was at a very low level, and he accused the American Congress of that.
Ekaterinburg Metro adopts a new payment method
In October the trip to Ekaterinburg Metropolis would be possible to pay a bank card, said OAO Director-General "I-Net" Pavel Wedernikov in an interview with "Regional newspaper".
Our goal is to introduce to the 2018 World Cup the same system of travel to the metro as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, the Netherlands and Novosibirsk.
"We want patients from other countries to be able to use the metropolis with their bank cards, without buying chips and not standing in line," he said.
Starts that will help your company not to become a regular Uber
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction of her e-commerce start-up staff, but the queries were not working.
The answers were often inflamed, useless, or, worse still, inaccurate.
Even though she had promised anonymity, some staff members did not trust this process.
“He was never consistent and objective,” said Errett, a manager of 75 Madison Reed, who was involved in e-commerce in hair care.
She therefore turned to third parties for assistance.
A new type of start-up is now emerging in the field of staffing, which helps companies to understand how their staff are feeling.
By designing and licensing software that is designed to measure staff turnover, they allow companies to make express inquiries, to contact certain teams and demographic groups, to offer staff anonymity and a hotline for complaints, and in some cases to allow informants to pass the top management and to direct direction.
“We now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit to monitor your health, and where is Fitbit for your company?” said Jim Burnett, co-founder and President of the Glint Launch from Redwood City, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure staff turnover.
Errett explained that she had more understanding of what her staff thought and felt for three years using Glint.
In addition to express queries and questionnaires of specific commands, the product offers a company's hot card and shows in a clear way which units have more complaints and which managers have low approval ratings, which allows it to understand why.
Companies are increasingly aware that they need to monitor the situation at work, otherwise they will become a regular Uber, which became involved in the scandal when a former employee posted a post on a blog describing the aggressive situation in which those who expressed discontent were punished.
For startups such as "Glint", it is a desire to control the situation - an opportunity for a profitable business.
According to the Internet portal “Let’s talk about pay”, dedicated financial technologies, the global management, regulation and compliance industry can cost more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
The "Convert" start from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year in the light of Uber's fall in reputation.
The Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber appeared among clients.
Like Glint, “Convert” enables companies to send individual questions of opinion, collect confidential responses in real time, and view hot maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that enables staff to report misconduct.
And if the top manager gets hit, the complaints go straight to the office.
“The public opinion court has taken over the authority of the inspectors,” said Patrick Quinnan, founder and president of the Convercent company.
If it is found that the company is ill-treated or unethical, even if the inspector is not involved, the company may face the costly effects of client boycotts, the flow of staff and court cases, Quinlan reported.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants, where more than 25,000 staff are working in 500 institutions, has been using Converter for more than a year to make sure that the staff are in the course of rules and procedures and to offer a simple way to contact the company's headquarters.
Earlier, if the staff member wanted to report the problem, he or she had to look for a telephone number or a head office e-mail, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and awkward experience, said James Vitrano, head of the Ruby Tuesday legal management, said that there was no normal way to track staff complaints.
Now that the company is using the "Convert" service, the problems that have previously been hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states – such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay – can be found and dealt with more quickly.
“I can get closer to a complete, comprehensive understanding of the situation of staff”, said Vitrano, who is the manager of the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
“And we protect our shareholders from judicial proceedings with staff.”
According to Queenland, companies began to take the ethics, values and engagement of staff in 2002 more seriously after the accounting company Artur Andersen suffered damage due to ethical violations resulting from the work of Enron.
But only when “social networks received mass distribution”, companies realized that they could not keep their dirty bag away from viral distribution in the network.
“Before using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both "Glint" and "Convert" offer their software as a service, taking regular payments from companies for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity to get the approval of the venture investors who supported the two startups.
In February “Convert” received $10 million funding from companies such as “Sapphire Ventures” and “Tola Capital”, resulting in the company's total capital of $47 million.
“Glint” received $10 million in November from “Bessemer Venture Partners”, resulting in the company's total capital of $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising if they take into account the interlinked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing volume of research shows that today's staff expect more jobs than it had been before.
In markets with fierce competition, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, this is only a minimum.
Staff members want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in companies, they feel that they are hearing them, and that the work they do is more successful, they try to make such a company more successful,” says Nina McQuein, the vice president of global benefits and satisfaction staff in LinkedIn, where “Convert”, and “Glint” are being used.
Investors receive income when business from their portfolio is going well; business is going well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytical instruments promise to increase the loyalty and involvement of staff, it is not surprising that they are supported.
According to cultural experts in the workplace, it is important to have data on the involvement of staff.
But the data is useless until the company's supervisors take action.
In fact, if the company requests feedback, it may create the impression that the change is a factor.
And if changes do not occur fast enough, or do not happen at all, disappointment may develop, and staff members lose interest.
“If you are going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you must be prepared to conduct 4,000 interviews,” says Russell Rat, president of the Kotter International management consulting company, who had to see companies making a mistake, relying too much on data collection.
'That is because, if you do not go to the end, they will say, 'Did you hear me?
You don't care?
Why should I not be equal to you?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly interviews with staff, is in a position to take action on the same day when someone is reporting the problem with Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from staff who were not at the speed of decision-making and quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to address problems.
Ruby Tuesday has received new knowledge about its staff and hopes that in the long term, this knowledge will help her to keep staff in a more efficient sector known as high-flowing staff.
"If you do not try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
A new asphalt of the Krasnoarmai perspective is hidden in Barnaule
In Barnau, a radical action was taken to eliminate the causes of the asphalt failures in the Krasnoarmaic perspective.
The place where the pits have appeared twice on a recently asphalt road trip (the crossing from the Young Street) is decided to “discover”.
It is recalled that a small section of the road near the tramway was disrupted because the land was in the area of an unexploded non-exploited network.
According to the Vice-Chairman of the Urban Committee on Road Agriculture, Welfare, Transport and Communications, a detailed survey will be carried out for the detailed investigation and removal of the conditions for disturbance.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected that recovery and concreteization will be required.
This is reported on the official site of the capital.
The Briins team has to take longer because the National Student Sports Association has cancelled twice a day training
The time is approaching eleven o'clock; a crowd of footballers from the California University of Los Angeles is being held back to join a new training field on one side of the campus.
Some of them walled their soccer bags and found their backs shining after the stormy first day of the sports camp.
For many players, these minutes of unemployment are a mid-day break.
After three-hour training, the players will be sent back to their homes to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning they will return to the Wasserman football centre at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned Tuesday, the coach of the Briins Jim Mora said, “The next three days these guys are waiting for a mess.”
The fact that the National Student Sports Association cancelled the training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the burden on players, actually extended their working days – at least until the exams ended on Friday.
Therefore, the first three training sessions of the California University team in Los Angeles were scheduled at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate them in and without a flat schedule of players.
The side effect of the lack of two trainings per day was more than one day, and Bruns is starting the camp almost weekly than last year and is conducting training during the summer school for the first time in the six seasons of the Sea in Vesuvius.
According to the schedule, they will have 18 training sessions before 20 August, including the start of formal training for the first season against the team of the A&M University of Texas in September.
She said that she supported the amendment of the rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that another paragraph had emerged as a result of it.
"In three or four days, we'll give them this huge burden, it's a serious test," said Mora.
"And they just beat him, they work, they're amazing guys.
I think that when we live until Saturday and we have more time, it will be really good."
At the end of the camp, the California University in Los Angeles will conduct closed training; this is not an easy task, since its fields are directly visible from the adjacent park and from the nearby Laskin Centre, a expensive hotel that has already been bombed with football balls that have crossed the protective network behind the doors.
The Briins players must take the hotel from these exits, but Mora allows for a problem to arise when the rooms are released during the season.
"We'll have security," said Mora.
"It's a serious problem, and I'm not overindulging the risk, assuming that someone can take the room off, sit there and record a video training.
If you have a training video, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there and security on parking number eight.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I won't be too worried about it.
We have a plan."
All those affected by the terror in Petersburg were hospitalized
All those who were injured at the St. Petersburg Metro in April were hospitalized.
This has been reported by Deputy Governor Anna Mityanin in the press.
According to data at the end of July, there were three people left in the station, broadcasting the TV Centre.
Remember, the explosion in St. Petersburg Metropolis began on 3 April this year.
The bomb blew up a terrorist death bomb named Akbarjon Jalilov.
As a result of the attack, 15 people were killed, as well as the perpetrator himself.
In the criminal case, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer, Abor Azimov, were arrested.
It was recalled that the Rossutan Authority had recently recommended that the Petersburg Metropolitan review a plan of transport security activities, inter alia, by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook enhances fact-finding in the fight against fake news
Facebook will more often send texts that are suspicious of mystifications, independent experts, and show their conclusions under original posts, the largest social network in the world, which is trying to combat so-called faecal news, said on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was starting to use improved machine learning algorithms to identify possible mystifications, send them for verification and perhaps show the results of the check-in under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways in which the so-called faecal news spread, which many believe have had an impact on the 2016 presidential elections in the United States.
This issue is also actively debated in Europe after the French voters had been misled by false communications before the presidential elections in May and in Germany before the September elections declared support for the plan to penalize social networks if they did not immediately remove hate posts.
On Thursday, in a separate German-language statement, Facebook reported on the testing of a new fact-finding algorithm that was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to seeing what reports are being challenged by independent reviewers, people want to have a broader context to make reasoned conclusions about what they read and what they share,” wrote Sara Sue, Facebook News Manager.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the function of "related articles" and work on other developments in the news chain in order to solve the problem of fake news.
Create a Romanian comic book: One lock in English history
In the recent past, Scotty's little castle was recorded in the Squeeze music video, and in the 1970s and 1980s he served as a port for Margaret Tettcher.
But 700 years from his quiet place in the Beul Valley in Kent County, he watched a rough history around, and now he inspired Jamie Rods, a Yorkshireman with a deep hair and a tendency to historical documents, to novel comics.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the character of a man who died 300 years ago," he said with enthusiasm.
"You feel it so personally when you hold this letter in your hand."
The Castle in England covers a period from the Middle Ages to the Evardian Age and tells about the families that lived in Scotland; each story has been illustrated by one of the young British artists, Isaac Lenkevic, Briony May Smith, William Axley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on archived data: in 2014, he wrote "Dear of the Dead and Other Stories" - a collection on the materials of the British Library; this project immediately crowned him to the depths of the soul.
"I was able to unravel just the fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working on the jackets," he says.
"It's his finger print."
And the letters will always smell smoke, because at that time the fire was lit for enlightenment.
And in 300 years' time, in the future, you think you're there too.
Oh, how I love archives!"
For a man who has such passion for old papers, getting support from the National Fund and the English Council of Arts and living in the castle for four months (I'm honest, I'm a little stuck there) seems too good to be true.
Rhodes has been studying the "new" Victorian castle for days, going to the archives, and looking at the many treasures of the names and ancient things -- for example, the heads of the giants on the walls or bottles, the centuries past.
He walked through the park and through the cracks of the old castle, talking to foresters, gardeners, and sometimes with artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then at night he "drinked whiskey and built to write."
The history of Scotty's castle is not very studied, because the National Fund had full access to it only in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassi, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the officers only began to understand the archive that he described as "the one that the aristocrats have laid down for centuries on the heart."
Newspapers, letters from the British Empire, maps showing who had what they had, "You think the land disputes are boring," says Rhodes, "but there were two families fighting for this beach.
That's right, guys!"
In some of the stories of the castles, the castles become a starting point for wider research in English history: for example, in the "Worker", the hero is from a newly built castle to join the 1381 Christian Revolution.
“There are reports of the rebellion that occurred in the castle in 1380, in a book called the Kent and Sassex Riszar families,” says Rods.
"The Christian rebellion began in these places, and I thought that rebellion was the right beginning.
Maybe they were connected?"
Other topics are closely related to the history of the castle, for example, "The Priest", in which the Jesuit priest, whose family had been hiding in Darrell for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "Contrabandist," about the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who was believed to have staged his own funerals by striking stones (this was discovered several years after the burial of the tomb).
Darrella, the beloved Rods family of all who lived in Scotty, said, "The gentlemen seem to have been a perfect gambler, they've gone into debt forever and spent money on what they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrella's men have solved their debt problems, marrying rich older women - I imagine them as a company of nice men who are able to care for the heirs of the great estate."
After the completion of the work at the Rhodes Castle, there will be other opportunities for a unique writing experience.
He lived in a Finnish noise for two weeks, where he wrote a graphic novel about Eliamyaki, a place where in the early 20th century he was a sanatorium, and then it grew again in the forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I had a hard time leaving," he says.
"I felt like this: damn it, I have to go back to real life again."
Fifteen largest banks choose "Russian"
The Russian Banks Association (ARB) conflict is developing: after Sberbank, WTB, WTB-24, Alpha Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselhosbank, Binbank and FC Open, seven other credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
As a result, at least 80 per cent of the market will be the percentage of organizations leaving the ARB.
But this is not just an outcome -- all banks that have declared a break with the ARB -- negotiate with another public organization that brings together credit institutions -- the Russian Association of Regional Banks, led by a well-known policy by Anatolio Axakov, Chairman of the Committee of the Government on the Financial Market, recognized, as a result of the last session and by the most effective leader of the Committee on Thoughts and a member of the number of draft laws.
The beginning of the conflict within ARB was introduced during a discussion in the Council of the Federation when the Interregional Banking Council considered new draft laws, in particular, requiring the reclassification of banks according to the size of the statutory capital.
Garegin Tosunyan, President of ARB, then said that, in the opinion of the association, the bill was adopted for the sake of the largest banks, which thus sought to limit the possibility of small and medium-sized banks in the regions, taking over their clients.
Other claims included criticism of the Central Bank, which, in the opinion of Tosunjana, did not always justify the withdrawal of licences from some banks, which, in truth, followed the objection by the representative of the CB: many of the leaders of the criminalised banks, in particular, outsideprombank, were included in the ARB ' s governing bodies.
It is apparent that this interchange of views is very sensitive to relations with the main bank environment regulator, and it has become apparent that the fifteen largest banks, with disagreement with the ARB policy, have begun to prepare to join the Russian association, noting that “the effectiveness of the ARB’s work will be low and that constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually being conducted”.
It'll be better for the investors.
What's the matter going to end?
Let us respond immediately to the main question that arises in the case of a minor failure or conflict in or near the banking sphere: the investors will not be threatened; rather, the security of the banking system will be enhanced.
The chapter is entitled “Russian” Anatolio Axakov, known for his generosity in all the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional who is highly appreciated in the Central Bank: almost all the management of the CB is present at the annual activities of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator are carried out through expert assessments of “regionals”.
The staffing-organization plan clearly does not provide for special shocks.
There is no doubt that the ARB is facing an uneasy financial and management situation after such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbyist opportunities are excluded.
However, this older organization, established in 1991, is of low interest to the banking community, with little potential to continue to improve banking law and the scope of monetary treatment in general.
It cannot be said that Russia is also ready to accept under any conditions new members, according to its leader, Anatolia Aksakow (which may be too much desired), who said on 21 July at a briefing in the press centre of Parliament's newspaper, that "on the next day, representatives from the ARB banks asked me to consider increasing the potential of our Russian association".
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council and to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiation process is now under way, both parties are studying the proposals, preparing an extraordinary association event that will take place in Sochi in mid-September in the framework of the International Banking Forum.
That's where we're going to be.
Anatoly Aksakov, also stressing that "not to be held behind the table", called a possible new leader of the updated Russian Association Georgia Luntovski, who left the post of Vice-President of the Central Bank in September, with a high profile of his business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatolio Axakov, who is now resting in Crimea, plans one day to discontinue his vacation and arrive in Moscow, at the extraordinary meeting of the Russian Association Council, which is scheduled to consider the agenda of the Russian Extraordinary Convention.
The entry of petrol engines into the major cities of Russia will not be restricted
The deputy head of Mintrans Nikolai Asaul said that despite media reports, the entry of fuel engines into the major cities of Russia would not be restricted.
It's a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept of gradually increasing the environmental class.
And there's the concept of going straight to zero emissions.
I don't think we're technically ready for this.
The question is, what year has it been?
That's the same thing at the word level, let's forbid it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Will we close the whole city?
"In 20 years, I don't know, maybe this will happen," says Prime Minister.
Earlier, the “Report” reported that by 17 August, Deputy Prime Minister Arkadia Dvorkovic had been commissioned to examine proposals for possible alternatives to electrical transportation submitted to the Government by PAO Director-General Kamaz Sergey Cogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, is the use of VTS cars in major cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for the receipt of the Green Card.
According to the media, President Donald Trump said that a new U.S. immigration plan would be adopted, which would change the rules for the receipt of a grain card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, a more stringent rule on temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in the two Chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and this will reflect changes in the way the United States issues credit cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce the chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will benefit English-owned candidates, have money resources that allow them to maintain themselves, and have skills that will benefit our economy," Tramp said, according to the American media.
The phenomenon of sex is real, and that should bother us.
We were unable to think that 2017 could no longer get worse, a new report on technological success in the production of sex jobs was received.
Yeah.
Sex work is now at the center of attention.
The Fund for Responsible Robotics (FRR) has recently issued a report on the development of sex work in the next 5 to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharki, a professor of robotics and artistic intelligence at the University of Cheffield and the FRR co-founder, we must take their appearance seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the robot eyes, the shape of the socks and the type of nails.
"People are horrified about this, but companies are already sending them to consumers in large numbers, and soon we will see them much more," Sharki said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex scenes have evolved from their intruders to silicone-skin robots, hot - to - touch, and almost human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also "crush" their robots at their own taste, choosing all from the color of the eye and the shape of the eyeballs to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a "personality" compared to which the Stepford woman would be very progressive is even more concerned.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix robot allows users to work on the qualities they find attractive, such as stiffness.
There are still the sex jobs of Roxxxxy Gold, developed by True Companion, which are provided with an already programmed individuality - for example, "The Cold Farra" makes the impression that it is solid, and "The Wild Wendy" has a bold character.
"Roxxy Gold has a character that fits yours perfectly," he says.
So she loves what you love, doesn't love what you don't love, and so on.
She's changing her mood for a day like this man!
She may want to sleep or chat, or she may be "in the mood"!"
In the emergence of sex robots, there is a lot of concern - not least because they replace real human relationships - but most of all concern the subjugated image of women, the association of rape that causes the cold (read: resistance) of Faro.
"True Companion" Roxxxxy is compared to the electorate, only for men.
"If there's a woman (sic!) there might be a voter, why can't men have Roxyxy?" - says the website.
But these sex jobs are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, a deviation from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex, subjecting as an optional supplement.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex jobs, and while FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain in the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very informative about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people aren't stupid or aggressive until the free market gives them an opportunity to do so.
It is not a coincidence that these difficult sex jobs have occurred when women's rights were threatened worldwide when the White House was a president who boasted that it was women's turn.
The most terrible thing in the Rasskas swanky teleseries is not graphic images, curved bodies and out-of-the-eyes, which is how much this vision looks realistic.
The Republic of Gilead is too big, but now it doesn't seem that big.
The aim of the sex-working industry is to achieve the physical similarity of real women (only with the proportions of porn stars), which allows technology.
Their Creators want them to appear to humans to copy the movements of the human body.
But it's just that his "characters" work doesn't look like women.
They can't break up with their partners or leave them.
They have neither their own life nor their biography - nothing that could indicate independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of full dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, they are ministers.
The native of Los Angeles Eugene (Puh) Jeter, who has been speaking for the gathering of Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European basketball championship, the final part of which starts on 31 August.
In an interview with the BeBasket portal, General Manager Andrei Lebedev reported that.
We tried to make a deal with Jeter, but unfortunately he won't come under family circumstances.
We're going to the Eurobasket without a naturalized game, because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will allow for the development of our young players," he said.
I recall that with Jeter's direct participation, Ukraine took the sixth place in the 2013 Eurobasket and for the first time went to the World Cup for basketball, where "gold blue" was unable to overcome the group stage, and the U.S. native picked up an average of 15.4 points, scored 3 picks, and gave 5 gears.
Jeter has stopped running for Ukraine since his departure from our national team's main coach, Mike Fratello, left this post in 2015.
The 2017 Eurobasket will take place simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will carry out its team tournament matches on the Promised Land.
The Evgenia Morzin in Group B will have five units: with Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament, our husband's collection was conducted by two checkpoints, in which the Dutch and Belarusians joined.
A big exaltation of the Trump?
Imagining Mita Romney seems very reasonable
In the Trampa era, it was common for political disputes that polarized the American electorate to have destroyed some families on a micro-level basis.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, U.S. newspapers have been censored by the columns on how to deal with terrible relatives who are voting for the Trump.
Looks like we're all under a lot of stress, so we're going to be rolling soon.
They're less talking about the Tramp's ability to unite families.
I'm writing about it because my cousin, the left-wing poet of Chicago, who had long been on knives with Republicans in his family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that joining in the fight against the common enemy could have a powerful effect.
At Trump's White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican brother, with whom she had argued about the policy for decades, was suddenly and strangely on the one side.
It is certainly good for dinner, but I can't think that in a broader context it might be dangerous enough.
The tramp inspired the force in the left flank, but the deforming effect of its control can move us all to the right.
When we're talking about Trump and "normalization", we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we'll stop hitting his way out.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which the Trump "normalizes" the most right Republicans who will suddenly appear to be a healthy model in the light of his standards.
I realized that today I miss the old-fashioned madness of Mitt Romney - with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14-percent income tax (at least we knew what his tax declaration looked like) - compared to Trump and then, and the other seems very small.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will simply be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we went with the kids to the carousel in the Central Park, the largest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best way to spend three dollars in the city if you don't need coffee.
Horrible and huge, pictures of glass fibers on the central drum are crippling clowns and animals that, looking out in horror, look at their backs, are extremely evil, and the enchanting music, as it were, is strange.
So many of the things known in this city are disappointed: the skyscrapers are getting old, the silhouettes of the buildings have come too far to cause a tremor, and the reality of the city is not succeeding in a dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still worried about the day I learned that the Swiss-Cattage area is actually not a Swiss joke (thematic pub "Ye Old Swiss Cottage") but a major crossroads in Northern London.
And Carousel in the Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a two-year-old child, a eleven-year-old child, and two-forty-year-olds can spend excellent time.
If I could make a score, I'd put a five, but fortunately, no one asked me to.
And at the university this week, I was asked to pass a terminal card to evaluate my "experience" purchases on a scale from one to five stars.
In the coffee shop at the corner of my street, the same plus the option to carry out a 15 per cent assessment of the tea is for a stand-by order.
As a result, not only does the idea of interaction slow down, but there is still a need for a personal relationship in a situation that does not involve it.
The poor salesperson at the university smiled with condolences while I was stifling my experience in giving her a credit card to five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pain
Pistorius leaves prison for visiting a doctor the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of lock cuts, which, according to the prison administration, resulted in his falling into the chamber.
Pistorius was convicted of intentional murder after the prosecution's appeal for an initial sentence for unintended murder.
He killed Steincamp early in the morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting several times through the door of the bathroom in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he took his friend for a night thief hiding in his bathroom.
The Prosecutor ' s Office stated its intention to protest another protest, this time against the six-year period of Pretoria, which she said was too soft.
The General Prosecutor ' s Office stated that it would be appropriate to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal would be considered this year.
Pretoria's time may increase by 15 years if the prosecutor's office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
A non-existence sign was chosen for the suspect's ICT journalist to be beaten
The civil rights defenders chose a measure of repression as a sign of a non-violence for a man who attacked a TV journalist, Nikitou Razvozzeeva, during a direct flight from the Park of Goriko on 2 August.
This is reported by the TAC with reference to the official representative of the IMF RF Irina Volk.
“In the context of the investigation of the criminal case initiated under article 116 of the RF ("Poboy") concerning a 32-year-old man who struck a telechannel in the Central Park of Culture and Rest, the name of the Goriko, the suspected choice of a measure of repression in the form of a non-violence and appropriate conduct,” explained Volk.
The representative of the IMF added that an administrative protocol for police non-refoulement had been drawn up with regard to the suspect.
On Wednesday, 2 August, during the direct air to the VV Day, a non-traffic man arrived and struck on the face.
As it happened later, the huligan has nothing to do with VAT.
In fact, according to Drozzayev, the deanists were trying to stop the mosquito.
Two Bulgarians were detained in Greece for illegal tent
According to the Bi-Ti-Vi, as reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent.
On 1 August, a group of people who had set up tents in an unfavourable location, including two Bulgarians, were detained in Sitonia.
They were released on the same day, while the result was still in progress.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the Bi-Ti-Vi television channel that Bulgarians were then released.
The Greek authorities have stepped up the control of the free campaign and have already imposed serious fines on all those who have been caught while in a position not intended for that place.
The tests will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may appoint a fine.
MID Russia accused US Vice-President in the rhetoric of the Cold War.
Statements made during the U.S. Vice-President Michael Penz's European tour were criticised by the Russian MIDI.
“Unfortunately, Washington is being pushed deeper into the primitive ideologied stamps of the cold war, which are completely deprived of reality,” said the Russian foreign political authority.
Thus, in the Middle Ages, Pensa responded to the words of the "Russian threat" and the attempts to force the border crossing that he had spoken of in Podgorica.
The Russian IID indicated that the choice "with the West or with Russia" was destructive, and that there was no evidence of the alleged non-alternative entry of all South-Eastern Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by using force to withdraw Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another source of tension.
"We call on American colleagues to stop the abuse of Russia and its foreign policy line, which is constantly based on respect for partners and willingness to work together constructively, on mutual interest," said the Russian MIDI statement.
Feldsher suffered in DTP with a "fast" in Podmoskovi
The DTP occurred in the sub-muscular stupino, resulting in a collision of the anomalies with the "Quick Help" carnet affected the fieldher.
Today around 08:10 msk was hit by a Mitsubishi car with a car of quick help in the town of Stupino Moscow area.
“As a result of the crash of the car, it was soon turned into a press release by the TASS in Moscow.
At the DTP site, law enforcement officials are working, and the circumstances of the incident are being clarified.
In the Odessa area, a woman threw her newborn son into the cellophane package.
On 3 August, a local resident reported to the Police Department that he had found a package with a child in an unconstructed private home.
“The law enforcement officers and doctors who quickly delivered the child to a medical institution have gone to the scene,” reported the National Police Chief of Odés.
The doctors determined that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of a doll.
The identity of the country ' s 36-year-old resident has been established during the priority operational and follow-up activities.
It was also found that the woman had three other minor children.
As noted in the chapter, the family did not previously fall into law enforcement and did not take special account.
The police are currently setting out the circumstances and reasons that have offered the woman the opportunity to proceed, after which a procedural decision will be taken.
The baby is now under the supervision of a doctor.
As reported earlier, a 21-year-old woman in Nicaragua had her unfavourable child thrown into a garbage dump.
Grigory Leps: "I'm fighting, though 55 is not 30."
One of the most successful artists of the Russian Estrada Gregorio Leps will cancel his 55th anniversary on Sunday.
Before the party, the singer had a conversation with the "Extendant" viewer.
I remember your "poltinique" being mentioned.
A special tent in the Lies, Gloria Gainor sings for the nominee, a powerful salad over the Moscow River.
You must have been wondering how you'd like to spend your next five years.
Have you lost your mind?
When it comes to profession, it was a good time.
I worked a lot, I went through the country three times, I gave 120-130 concerts a year.
He released two bad albums.
Of course, I'm no longer what we say 20 years ago.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Singing like I sang in my 30s is getting harder.
Still, I'm fighting, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, and I think I'm going to a different level.
You've been writing a new album with them for the first three years.
Yeah, it's working on him now.
Actually, we've already written it down in my studio, and now we're going to take it to Los Angeles.
It's called "What are you so serious?" on a solo song written together with Timothy.
She's not ready yet, so we haven't taught her yet.
We'll do it later when the clip on it is taken.
And we'll present the album in November to a series of my Christmas concerts in Moscow's Crocus City Hall.
A classic American drummer Chris Coleman put his hand on your new plate.
Do you think you wanted to get him into your gastropod?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world today.
He came to me at the studio, recorded his party.
I invited him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson, a well-known drummer who participated in various projects.
But for long-term work in Russia, they have raised excessive conditions.
It was about the fees from €35,000 to €45,000 a month.
At that time, I thought the post-Soviet space was looking for worthy musicians.
And he found Max Malishev's excellent drummer.
It is better to feed yourself.
In time, I want to talk to any of them, not for anything.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumm is highly international.
It's written by Western music magazines, invited him to various guitar festivals.
Steve Way, when he heard his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists came with another executive technique."
Your album is in Los Angeles, American musicians are working with you, but you still can't come to the United States yourself?
Are you trying to remove this ban?
Now, honestly, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers who deal with this issue.
As a musician, I'm really sorry that I can't go to America.
I never said I was studying there.
The more you communicate with these professionals, the more useful you are.
We don't drown them, but we don't have that kind of experience, school.
Before our performers of popular music for 70 years, the challenges that American musicians have always faced have not been fully met.
They were striving for the highest quality sound.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now why did Britain refuse to come into my office for ten years?
But I'm going to submit visa papers to the British Embassy every year to allow me to go there again and the most important thing is to work there.
The rest of Europe is kind to me.
And in August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not a party, but an office, right?
Yeah, there's a good sports hall in Monte Carlo, I've spoken there once.
Now they've been invited again, and, as far as I know, all the tickets to the concert have already been sold.
"Randev Lyme Wycule", which will start on July 20th in Yurmala, will you go?
She invited me, and I, of course, responded.
Lima is a remarkable singer and a beautiful woman who is able to give herself a beautiful ring and even a whisper.
After the gastronomy and the Christmas concerts, as far as I know, you want to turn to the creation of Vladimir High.
You've got two albums with his songs on the record.
When's the third one coming out?
Probably next year.
But he'll be completely different.
I want to write about 80-90 songs of the Highness about in the same feed as he did himself.
Just a voice and a guitar.
No other arrangement.
I'm going to be a partner of our famous musician, Timour Wedernikov.
I'm trying to get involved in the album and Alexander Jakovlevic Rosenbaum.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's busy, so let's see how it works.
You and Boris Grebenškov's songs gradually entered your repertoire.
Maybe you'll write his album?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a wonderful musician.
I went through with him a few times and asked, "Can I sing that song?
He said, "Grygory, I'm writing songs for them to be fulfilled."
Please try it, come on.
It's probably interesting to write that album.
While I don't have a job like that, but in the future, in two years, if Boris Borisovich won't object, I might be doing a project like that.
If you don't concentrate fully on the business of your industrial centre.
I don't think you've signed contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers I wish I had under my wing, but they are self-contained, people.
You mean Sergey Lazarev?
Serena is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I can't agree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and he has his development strategy.
And now there's Alexander Panayotov in my center, which I took to Golos.
We made a deal with him and we work.
In our pop music, such songs are rare.
It'll be a real shame if he doesn't reach the heights he deserves.
I'm trying to improve his repertoire, I'm taking pictures.
I hope for a good outcome.
I'm also trying to move other artists from my center: I buy them songs, I pay for poets, sometimes their tracks fall into the rotation of television and radio channels.
If they do not achieve great heights, I will nevertheless lead our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
They'll get a written album on their way out, a couple of videos.
And further, if they want, they can go their way, and I won't insist that they get the money back into them.
Although I would be pleased if any of them were to gain commercial success and pay me the percentages we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to cover the oxygen for anyone.
Let everyone work, break, prove how I used to prove it.
If you're invited to a gastro-tour tomorrow in Ukraine and they guarantee entry to the country, will you go?
I'm still being invited there.
The main focus is on closed activities.
And as for the big tower...
I am the man of my country, a Russian, who, in his own conviction, flew to Syria on the same plane that was then destroyed.
If they say tomorrow that they have to fly to some other point for the sake of the State, I'll take it.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think about me.
I am truly sorry that we have had such a situation with Ukraine.
Because I think we're one people and we're supposed to be together.
I'm sorry that this is not going to happen, at least in the near future.
And I used to give 40-50 concerts in Ukraine in a year.
They've met nowhere.
Thank you very much.
And he collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Annie Lorak, St. Loboda, Artem Loika...
In Ukraine, the masses of donated people, and sincerely regret that they cannot now fully tap their talent into a broad Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I would be pleased to invite a classic Ukrainian executive to Russia, such as Slavou Wakarcuk, and to have a joint concert with him.
But, I think at this point, it's unlikely...
Andrey Ochlopkova was thrown with a cosmodrom
As it became known, the technical director of the outer space East Andrei Ohlopkov started working at the State Space Science and Production Centre (HCNPC) named Hruniceva.
It had previously been de facto in the construction of the Eastern Cosmodrom, but because of disagreements with the management of the Centre for Land and Space Infrastructure (CENCI), it was transferred to a company in the Moscow Philosophy, where the coordination of production would take place.
Mr. Ohlopkov's replacement will not be: the post of technical director will probably be cancelled and the staff member will be disbanded by the CENCI units.
The fact that the Technical Director of the East and Deputy Director-General of the CENCI for Technology Development, Andrei Ohlopkov, went to work on Hruniceva's HCNPC, "U" told the top managers of several space industry companies, as well as government staff.
"He's been working on a new post for a few weeks," said the U-industry interviewers.
It was not possible to obtain CENCI ' s operational comment on Thursday, and Mr. Ohlopkov himself was not available for comments.
However, the information “U” was formally confirmed in the CCNPC.
He decided to move to the position of the Director of Production Coordination, said to the companies. - Andrei Ochlopkov, the task of providing a minimum for the first launch on the east coast, had been fully implemented.
Mr. Ohlopkov went to work at CENCI in 2013, with his shoulders in space troops, in particular at Bayconure, and in Plesecke, he served as the first deputy commander in the "North" cosmodrome.
In 2009, Andrei Ochlopkov became a criminal figure.
The prosecution accused him of being in custody: it was alleged that the regional traders had received a bribe but had failed to fulfil the commitments made to clean separate parts of the aircraft in the Archangel region and the Republic of the Commission.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
The responsibilities of CENCI for technological development were extended to various projects, but the main project was the construction of a cosmodrom in the Far East.
The then headquartered Federal Space Agency Oleg Ostapenko, in an interview with "U", directly said that the situation in the East was "critical already in October 2013".
The case is that there was a strategic error in planning: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Union-2.1 carrier rocket was planned at the same time as at the end of 2015.
In order to complete the launch by the end of the year, the completion of the construction was decided by mid-years earlier and the deadlines were set from December to July 2015.
In order to accelerate the process, skill had to be gained: CENCI specialists began to install parallel technology equipment on unencumbered facilities.
The main proponent of this idea was Andrei Ochlopkov.
In spite of the existing risks and still the transfer that took place (as opposed to the Union flying only on 28 April 2016), this idea justified itself, the source of the "U" said on the cosmodrom: " Otherwise we would not have carried out any launch with the East yet, but would have done the construction."
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitri Rogozin, who was driving the construction of a cosmodrom, called Andrea Ohlopkov his "space Susanini", but he almost always asked for information about the state of the building.
He recalled Mr. Ochlopkov's point of view: for example, in the "U" interview, he suggested that the Federal Special Building Agency (Specstra) be excluded from the status of the only performer on the East and working directly with subcontractors: "Why should we keep all eggs in one box of Specstra?"
This idea was supported by the Government.
Since 2017, CENCI has assumed the responsibility of the contractor-general to allow the construction work to be completed at the start-up and technical complex to be completed by the fourth quarter.
According to "U", Mr. Ohlopkov's transition to a new workplace resulted in disagreements with CENCI's management on how to complete the construction and construction of the cosmodrom complexes, as well as working methods with subcontracting organizations.
"It was decided that this would be better for all," said one of the top managers involved in the East.
The official of the Government apparatus, in turn, calls it a strange decision: "He was one of the best specialists, finding equal replacements would not be easy for him."
According to "U", this will not be required: the post of technical director of the cosmodroma will be abolished and its functions will be disbanded by the CENCI units.
A two-special training programme will be held in music schools
In the future, students of children’s music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture of St.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken control of this issue, and we, together with the expert community, are developing a mechanism that will allow two specialties to be adopted, but will not be contrary to the existing legislation in the field of education," Goubenko said.
Last Friday, during the Sunday Talk, Vladimir Putin, a student at the Syrian Children's Centre, told the student, Maria Andreywa, that he had to pay for the repeated items for the second specialty in the CMS at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl told me that she was studying in the violin and piano class and had awards for both courses.
The Head of State recognized her question very relevant and promised to help.
17-year-old Russians arrested in Mexico on the wall
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russian Kirill N., who is on the wall on the roof of the high building, reports the El Universal portal.
The incident occurred in Mexico City.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, went through a three-metre checkout on the territory of Nestle's office building complex and took himself to one of his pools.
However, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and rope.
The young man was already on the roof.
Staff of the Ministry of Public Security landed him on the ground on a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute of Migration.
It explains whether a young person is legally present on the territory of the country.
In the meantime, a video with a young high - ranking man has become popular in the Network.
The users called the young man a spider.
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, milk products and chocolates can help facilitate CPC.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your food tract.
But recent studies say that diet, rich in meat proteins and dairy products, can help to alleviate symptoms for those who suffer from infectious diseases.
It is an incurable disease that affects some 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, leading to the loss of life, chronic or bloody pride, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Usually it is recommended to avoid meat and milk products to relieve symptoms, but researchers at the University of Washington found that the main amino acid triptophane contributes to the production of immune cells that increase the suction tolerance.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that the immune cells in the pocket watch that harmful microbes coming from food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of starting the combustion process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protect the body, and do not harm sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too severe to the side of the ignition, it may lead to inflammatory diseases of the bladder.
The experiments showed that the mice with certain bacteria in the pocket have an increased cell tolerance.
And the bacteria need a triptophan, one of the building elements of the protein, to start these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of the normal microbe of the yeast, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more triptophans were fed in the mouse, the more these immune cells had."
He suggested that the same would work for people: the combination of L. reuteri and rich triptophane diets could contribute to a more tolerant and less prone to the inflammation of the environment in the basin.
Dr. Luis Servantes-Barraghanvas, postman of the postmen, studied the variety of immune cells that had increased tolerability, found that one group of mice had these cells and another group that belonged to the same line but contained them separately did not have them.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the microbial of the mouse, by the communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the stomach and toxin tract.
The cell DNA of the mouse was sequenced, and six types of bacteria were found in mice with immune cells but not in mice that did not have them.
Mouses grown in a sterile environment that did not have good microbials and that did not develop this type of immune cell received L. reuteri, and immune cells appeared.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers have grown L. reuteri into a liquid environment and then transferred small portions of fluid - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells derived from the mouse.
Immune cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it was a lateral product of triptaphane, known as indole-3-moleic acid.
When researchers doubled the number of triptophans in the mouse food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the level of triptophan was reduced twice, the number of cells also decreased twice.
Dr. Servantes-Barragan explains that people have the same tolerability of the cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in their pelvic tract.
It is not known whether L. reuteri side products contribute to the development of cells in people as well as in mice, but in people suffering from respiratory diseases, there have been defects in triptophane-related genes.
She said, "We may have to strengthen the development of these cells, because these cells depend on the internal surface of the cells.
High levels of triptophan with L. reuteri may potentially lead to increased population."
According to José Morinou, Manchester United has hired genius in the face of the Matics of Germany.
Manchester United hired “genies” in the face of Nemjani Matić, José Maurein considered after half-defender debuted in the match against “Samphoria” on Wednesday evening.
The game, which was purchased for 40 million pounds at Chelsea, began with a 2-1 win in Dublin in the last pre-season match United in front of the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Thursday, and made an impression on the role of a semi-defenser, while the players of the Polly Pogba and Andreas Periri broke in front of them when they were blessed.
However, since Matic did not participate in the pre-season Chelsea tour in Asia, he did not take the preparations for the game seriously, and he lasted only 45 minutes, which, according to Maurein, required further preparation before the beginning of the prime league season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius, as he thinks, he thinks football," said Maurine.
“We will help prepare him sooner than late.”
Just like Matic, his new friends Victor Lindelöf and Romel Lukaku started the game at the Aviva Stadium when Maurinju began to form its main composition for the beginning of the next season.
The Independent reported this week that Maurine wanted to hire three more players, but argued that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he wanted to hire first.
"I am grateful to the club for having won three out of four," he added.
“I am even more pleased if they get me four of the four, but they have already tried hard for me.”
Former Lithuanian Social Democratic Leaders Condemned They Remain in the ruling Coalition
Former Presidents of the Democratic Socialist Party of Lithuania, former Prime Minister Algirdas Butkievich and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as former Social Democrats Speaker Cheslovas Yurshenas, urged single parties to remain in the ruling coalition.
As the Parliament's newspaper reported, due to training with partners, the Alliance of Crescents and Greens, a discussion was initiated in the Social Democratic Party, whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
And here are three senior experienced partners to the one-party open letter, which states, inter alia,: “The continued disappointment of the party partners in the election results, but the coalition with the “Christians” has created for us not very easy, but still the conditions for further implementation of the social justice goals set out in the Government programme, and for maintaining the political domination of the left-wing centre over the right parties”.
According to the party's former leaders, the discussion has so far “began an emotion-based expression of opinion without specific arguments”.
The authors are afraid that unimaginable actions by their party may lead to political, economic and social instability in Lithuania.
A fine was imposed on the disabled, Antonio Mamayev.
Mosgorsud has mitigated the punishment of a disabled driver named Anton Mamayvu from four and a half years of imprisonment to a fine of 200 thousand.
Formerly, the decision of the Timorese Court was released from the CISO.
Mosgorsud has confirmed that the accused is a criminal, since he has organized the robbery and kidnapping of a motorcycler in the former expert.
By his decision, Mosgord has mitigated the punishment of Anton Mamayov to 200 billion punishments.
“Mamaev is an organizer of crime, which also constitutes a crime, and should therefore be charged with criminal liability,” explained the “U” press secretary Mosgorsud Uljan Solopova.
In this case, the court took into account the health status of Mamaeva, the actual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the Court applied article 64 of the FP, which provides that a lower penalty may be imposed.
With regard to Assistant Mamayva Vasili Serostanov, the court did not establish circumstances that would be the basis for changing the severity of the sentence and the change of the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself stated that he was not satisfied with Mosgorsud's decision.
I'm disappointed in the court's decision.
The only legal solution would be a justification for continuing to fight for justice.
His lawyer, Andrey Orlov, did not rule out appeals against a sentence in the Mosgorsud case and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the cases even before the European Court of Human Rights," he said, "the RIA of News".
The 28-year-old Anton Mamaev Moscow, who suffered from spinal atrophy, was a criminal figure in the fall of last year.
The invalid claims to have bought a motorcycle from a known man in 160,000 rubbs to sell later.
However, the owners of the motorcycle, including the former expert, said that the disabled person and his assistant Vasili Seroštanov had chosen their property, threatening to resort to violence.
On 30 June, the Timorese District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasilia Serostanov to three years in the colony, and Anton Mamayeva to four and a half years in prison with a penalty in the general regime colony (art.
After the disembarkation of the disabled was placed in the SISO, the General Chamber, the Office of the Human Rights Officer of President Tatian Moskalkova, joined the case.
As a result, Anton Mamaev was released from SISO in mid-July by the same decision of the Timorese Court.
Protection, in turn, appealed to the decision of the first instance in Mosgorsud.
UNF will prepare a report on the environment to the President
The “Forum of Action” of the General People's Front (UNF) in 2017 will address environmental issues, reported the “Reports” source to the UNF and confirmed the head of Alexie Anisimov.
He said that, as a result of the Frontoviki forum, he planned to prepare a report to the President on domestic environmental issues and to propose a strategy for their solution.
The briefings in the UNF noted that the report of the head of State would contain a “deep analysis” of the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to the Reports, the final forum of the UNF will be autumn.
Its exact date has not yet been determined - usually under the President ' s schedule, which is the leader of the movement and is traditionally present in the key activities of the UNF.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts, in Rostové-na-Donu, Kaliningrade and Kirov.
The outcome will be a conference in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been made and will be put forward in these activities, we are also making systematic proposals to address environmental problems, as told by the UNF ' s "Reports " .
The Co-Chair of the Central Movement of Olga Timofeeva, headed by the Committee of the Gosdoms on Environment and Environment, reported that the “frontows” would report to the head of the State on the work carried out during the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The outcome of the environmental forum and the UNF Forum of Action will likely be brought together.
Over the year, we have grown a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental problems, seen gaps in legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be in the report that we will prepare for the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition, “Frontows” are also reported on the priority projects of the UNF,” said Olga Timofheeva.
She said that a special representative of the Head of State on environmental, environmental and transport issues, Sergei Ivanov, would be invited to the forum.
He had previously participated in the UNF Media Forum, which took place in St. Petersburg in April.
A few months later, the Year of Ecology will go into history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms to work for years.
To prevent these issues from getting out of the agenda, she added Olga Timofheev.
The head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute of Social Research (EICI) Andrei Kolyadin noted: In raising the environmental issue, the UNF is acting as a member of the presidential agenda.
Many things they offered as experts in various forums, and these initiatives received the President's support, said "Reports" to Andrei Kolyadin.
He stressed that the economic capacity of the environmental agenda could not be excluded to date, which could give regions additional impetus to development.
Further, the UNF will be able to address not only its environmental problems, but also the development of ecotourism, the expert added.
The current environmental issue demonstrated the "direct line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked about the garbage dump in Balashe and about the coal dust in the port of Nachotka (a draft law on the prohibition of open coal spills in human settlements, one of the authors, Olga Timofheev).
Ecological experts believe that the legal basis for addressing environmental problems in Russia is established in general, the issue is a further law enforcement practice, as well as the position of civil society.
A clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State is considered to be the head of the Ecology for All Fund Leonid Bochin.
A member of the SPC, the head of the NGO Greens Russia, Sergei Ciplenkov, in the discussion with the "Reports", stressed that a responsible approach to society and business is needed to address environmental problems successfully, with few legislative efforts.
As soon as society and business are aware that environmental problems - much more strategically, the situation will change - Sergei Ciplenkov noted.
The expert stressed the need to break the trend that the violation of environmental legislation was an economically beneficial solution to the business.
The British inventor used a microchip to get into the house and the hand-to-hand car
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip set up so that he could open the door of his home, enter the office, and even drive a car with a simple handvoltage.
Steven Nortem, a 30-year-old, has used a cross-sectional chip between large and indicative fingers and now, through his BioTec, offers this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their life for technology.
He joined Dr. Jeff Watson, anesthesiologist from the Queen of Winchester, in order to ensure that the procedure for use was conducted in accordance with medical standards.
Technology is similar to a microchip that uses cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Nortema also replaces locks in houses and cars on compatible with a price chip of 300 pounds per lock.
One child's wife's father has already set up a technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which is made when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House's Recquisite was paid thousands of dollars to taxpayers
According to the records of the armed forces provided by the TIME magazine, the White House's decision last month to push the marine infantry helicopter to the South Bank for an event dedicated to American industrial production was $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as “Marine One”, when the board is the president, has become the central element of the event held in the White House on 17 July, which demonstrated American construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pens and senior White House officials have examined technological products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was displayed near the man State yacht, a fire car from Wisconsin, and a Mississippi truck.
According to the records of the First Squadrel of Marine Helicopter (HMX-1), the division responsible for helicopter management, the Military Office of the White House ordered the presence of a helicopter in a private order, or “FRAGO”, at least 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the Southern Hemisphere in the event of “ordinary” activities.
“I just wanted you to make sure that you were in the course, because it is an unusually wide-ranging event in the press,” wrote Commander HMX-1 in an e-mail to his chief, the first vice-president of the Marine Corps, in advance of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Pole about 7 a.m. on 17 July to participate in the three-hour event, and would remain there until the gas would be released between 6 and 9 evenings on the same day.
The letter adds that if departure from the White House would be delayed, a second flight crew would be required in accordance with working hours.
The first crew escorted the helicopter during the operation and the unit guards stayed close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It was unclear whether the second crew had been required from the time records received from the TIME magazine.
The Hetcha Act prohibits federal servants from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 has clarified whether the event is contrary to this decision.
“We asked, among other things, whether it was a violation of Hetch’s law, and we were asked what it was not,” the commander wrote.
"It seems like you're not going anywhere," said the Deputy Chief.
The event “Sedelano in America” was declared by the White House as an official event, and the law of Hetcha did not extend to it.
But even official activities have political notes.
During his activities, the President made efforts to promote the health reform that was then being developed in the Senate and praised attempts to regulate government decisions.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is almost new.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But to ask them only for the possibility of a photo is unusual.
Trump has already been the subject of discussions in February, when the President's plane was on its backstage during his first election meeting in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is filled with complaints about the use of his predecessor's presidential aircraft.
“The White House, with the horror of the show “Sedelano in America”, which presented products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials,” said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House Lindsey Walters.
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights around the Washington Aglomeration and the South Lobster to train the transport of the President of the United States to the White House with accuracy to the thumb.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training sessions at the White House.
According to one official, a flight carried out for Svelano in America was counted for the necessary training flights per month.
The unit's helicopters also flowd 11 additional hours on that day as part of “non-presidential support tasks”.
According to the White House, the taxpayers were not charged for any of the other exhibitors represented at the event.
The representative of Sikorsky reported that the company had not taken part in the organisation of the helicopter demonstration in the South Bank.
HMX-1 does not budget the presidential field, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to the time rates of the Ministry of Defence for 2017, the rate of reimbursement of the Ministry of Defence for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight.
The unit records that the flight time in the air was 30 minutes on each side of its airport based on the Quantico Marine Corps in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual value of using the helicopter is much lower than that rate.
“To calculate the value of taxpayers based on an exemplary rate of reimbursement is wrong,” says Walters.
“These exemplary rates include personal composition, servicing and many other irreversible costs that are included in annual allocations”.
According to a study conducted by the RED Corporation in 2015, reimbursement rates do not include the value of the personal composition, but, indeed, take into account the value of the fuel, services and costs specified in the contract.
At that time, the former Press Secretary of the White House, Sean Spyser, spoke for the protection of the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to show this week things done in America," said Spyser.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to national security, and that there are hundreds, if not thousands of people, whose job depends on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we're all proud of this helicopter and other military technology over which so many Americans have been constantly working.
It is therefore appropriate, of course, to draw that attention.”
It was unclear whether Trump was working with the helicopter, watching the South Pole during the event, but he was exactly sitting in the driving position in the fire truck.
Within the White House, Trump approached Sikorsky's representatives with a press release on his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President. "I have three of them."
Moscow will grant grants to city hospital rehabilitation offices
Every year, the Save Life Grants will be awarded to city hospital rehabilitation and intensive care facilities.
The funds are used to encourage doctors and nurses.
The mayor of Moscow Sergei Sobjanin visited the City Hospital of Judah.
During his examination of the clinic, he handed a thank-you letter to Dr. Victor Prozko, who led the most difficult operation to reconstruct the adolescent stage.
Sergei Sobianin also told about the decision to allocate annual resuscitations and intensive care facilities to the city clinics.
The funds will be directed towards the promotion of doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor, Judah’s clinical hospital is today one of the largest in Moscow.
In recent years, new modern equipment has been introduced to the clinic to enable doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of the Colomen Village Hospital.
There are now more than a thousand patients in the medical office.
In addition to resuscitation and stationing, there are day offices.
The state of the hospital staff has 2,800 staff.
The total area of the hospital is 23.7 ha.
In February of the current year, the medication was a part of the pilot project for short-stay station organization (SCP).
They are intended for relatively small operations.
In surgery, advanced medical equipment is used to significantly reduce patient rehabilitation.
After the operation at the station, they spend only a few hours.
Only during the first half of the year in the hospital on behalf of Judah was hospitalized for 36,000 patients.
Clinical staff carried out 15,800 operations at different levels of complexity.
NBU reported the absence of buyers of the Ukrainian “daughter” Sberbanka
In Nazbanke, Ukraine (NBU) reported that there were no requests for the purchase of the Ukrainian "daughter" Sberbanka.
On Friday, 4 August, the TASS reported on this subject with reference to a representative of the NBU press.
NBU confirms that on 3 August 2017, a package of documents from the citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, Viktor Prokopani, to harmonize the acquisition of 100 per cent of Sberbank shares (through Paritybank).
“There were no documents from other potential investors for the purchase of shares of Sberbank in NBU”, notes the communication.
On 3 August, Belarusian businessman Viktor Prokoppenja withdrew the application for the purchase of the subsidiary structure of Sberbank.
On 28 July, it became known that Nacbank Ukraine had denied Russian businessmen Saydu Guceriev and Gregory Guselinik to acquire a Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision that businessmen had not provided the necessary documents to verify compliance with Ukraine ' s legislation.
Sberbank reported on the sale of its Ukrainian daughter to Norvik Banka and a private Belarusian company in March of the current year.
Said Guceriev, son of Russian businessman Mikhail Guceriev, was a major shareholder of the consortium.
Penalties against the "daughter" of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
During the year, they were prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country for the benefit of maternal organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, stated in the UN.
Elections may be representative only when all members of society, including women, have participated in them, said on Wednesday, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan.
According to Nicolas Haysoma, the head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are embroiled in the provincial councils, three women are fighting for the Vice-President, and more than 30 per cent of re-registered voters are women.

Electricity is cheap for both the inhabitants and the goods producers of Buratia
The efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Burma (East Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity users have begun to bear fruit.
From 1 September to 25 per cent, the value of electricity is reduced in low voltage to industrial customers.
The Federal Anti-monopoly Service of the country, in accordance with the Government of the Russian Federation ' s decision " On the amendment of the optimist market regulation of electricity and power and on the consolidated forecast balance of production and supply of electricity (power) within the framework of the Russian Single Energy System of the entities of the Russian Federation" (since 17.07.2017 No. 842) established indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial users of the Republic of Burma.
As a result, the value of electricity for storm-produced heavy goods producers is reduced by four, making life easier for small and medium-sized enterprises and for individual entrepreneurs significantly easier.
For decades, the leaders of the republics have challenged the thresholds of the Moscow Cabinets in a futile attempt to compare the region in tariffs from the nearby Irkutsk area with the dropout of hydroelectric plants in Angara from Baikal, the main watershed territory for which Burratia is.
And only this year did the movement begin.
In March, the tariffs for electricity for the population of the Republic decreased from 4.24 rub./kWh to 3.93 rub./kWh, or 7.3 per cent.
With the inclusion of the Buratia Federal Government decision in the List of the Valuable Areas of the Optic Market, for which the features of the operation of the optical and differential markets have been established by industrial consumers.
In the opinion of analysts, this is only the beginning, as the population of the Irkutsk area pays for kilowatt/hour of 1.01 rubles.
But no one dares to call at least the approximate date of the new tariff movements towards the humiliation of Burati.

National Trade Union of Unqualified, Municipal and Railway Workers (GMB) is concerned about investment in McVitie's factory in Glazgo
The trade union requires guarantees from the managers of the McVitie's cookie manufacturer in connection with his long-term obligation to produce at the Glazgo plant.
The Scottish GMB reports that the company has been silent on the issue of future investment in the tolcross facility.
More than 500 people are working at Hobnobs and Rich Tea.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, reports that over the last few years, it has invested more than $5 million in the facility.
The company adds that in the event of any change in the operation of the facility, staff and union representatives “will be the first to know about them”.
In a letter to the head of the company, the Scottish GMB office demanded McVitie's responses to concern that funding would not be allowed to modernize production lines.
Senior Organizer Drew Daffy said: “Our trade union is deeply concerned that we cannot get the clarity from the head of the facility on business needs and investment plan regarding the future of Tolcross”.
Families worked here for generations, and the concentration of large workers in local society and in the territory of the Greater Glasgo; this is the key pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social depravity.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in front of Brexit, the growth of the living minimum and the chronic decline of production, East-End Glazgo desperately needs to flourish at McVitie's factory.
According to the representative of Pladis, “The Tolcrosian Guide only received a letter yesterday from the Scottish GMB office, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our continued cooperation with staff and trade union representatives.”
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with GMB staff and representatives in Tolcross, where a number of issues were discussed openly.
We have talked to staff about how all companies operating in the most competitive and unstable economic climate are constantly reviewing our actions – and this concerns all our facilities and activities – in order to remain competitive.
“In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our tolcross facility, especially in production lines and improvement of functional indicators.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a productive object, and in the event of any changes in the activity, the staff and representatives of the trade union will know about it first."
Putin stated that the authorities would not give direction to Rosnefti and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petroleum Company (WNHC) should be connected to Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers, but the Gazprom instructions, like Rosnefti, would not be given.
Thus, the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, responded to the request of Igorya Sečina to contribute to the resolution of the contradictions.
The Head of State pointed out that relations between Rosneft and Gasprom should be resolved solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, Rosnefti, Igorj Sechin, at the meeting on major investment projects in the Far East Federal District, said that the lack of agreement with Gasprom on gas for HNHC threatened the implementation of the project.
The Secretary noted that the dialogue with Gasprom on this issue continued.
Gasprom proposes to find gas resources from Rosnefta, but we don't have such resources," Secin added.
Recall that Rosneft requested her permission to use gas for the East Petroleum Company from the Kyrinian Gasproma Location, located on the Shelf Sahalin.
In June, Gasprom stated that the negotiations on this issue continued, and “there are no sharp angles”.
Did the Barcelona GSP warn you of the transfer of Neimar three years ago?
A participant in La Ligi may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
“Pari St. German” will not stop chasing Naaman after the club offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona about the world's record of flight held three years ago?
The sensational proposal revived a more summer transfer window when Club League 1 was ready to beat the world record of the transition, more than twice the previous note related to the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester United in the last 89 million pounds season.
When the transition is over, Naymar will become the most expensive game in the world, as well as the most highly paid professional sportsman in the world, since the PSC offers him over 500,000 pounds a week clean.
It is known that Barcelona and the anger of the proposal, and how Neimar broke the contract, despite the fact that, as a source close to the management of the Catalan club, the club has always done everything possible for the game since its transition from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the football world a warning about that three years ago by President PZJ?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the rental of Blaze Matouidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi issued a strong warning to every club that wanted to change one of the best players in the PSG.
“I’m not worried, because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we’ll fight them, we’ll make suggestions to their players,” Al-Helaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they will be struck by the consequences.”
According to all, Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in the semi-defenser from the PZJ Marco Verratti.
The PSCs understood that they would not release the Italian assembly game under any circumstances, and now Barcelona is probably experiencing the consequences of its proposal as a loss of one of its most valuable players, Nemara.
