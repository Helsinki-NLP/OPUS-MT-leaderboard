I want to be a coward.
I'm going to school.
Do you mind?
Are you all right?
It's a big deal.
I'm staying here.
I've seen a spree in the zoo.
A thousand years ago.
Do you want to go ahead?
Look, a bee tree.
I want this thing done to Tom.
I'm pretty big.
And he drowned him.
She was like a girl to me.
Are you all right?
I don't need any kind.
I lost my soul.
I haven't forgotten.
Where are you going, Galleg?
I want a guitar.
What are you doing?
I know you!
I know Tom's fine.
The list is up to date.
Are you here?
She was a slow girl.
It's stupid.
My book is on your desk.
I'll tell you what you want to get.
It's in private.
I don't know, Tom, Mary was quite familiar with the French language.
You!
Look, it's an aphrodisiac tree.
The letter has not been written yet.
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
The verse is gone.
Please ask me.
It can't be.
This is not a phrase.
Tell me what you want to get.
Can I have a little bit of a wait?
Lous and walnuts.
Is he white?
You got a car?
A thousand pals.
You don't want to go in your father's direction.
He's a good-looking guy.
Welcome to Tatoeba!
Tom was talking.
Do you have a car?
Thank you.
I lost my wisher.
It's a fruity thing.
What's your address?
Who took all the cookies from?
Don't wait.
Do you like the black man?
It wasn't a mistake.
Don't talk to me!
Naf, it's the bad guy.
He was the first guy.
They don't make a bite.
You're under pressure.
He was dressed like a woman.
Is there still a head?
Watch out!
He's got a head inside.
I don't have one.
Don't leave me alone.
I don't know.
I was robbed of my money on either side.
The study is in an external language.
Tom's a good friend of mine.
He was preaching to Tom.
You're under the spell.
He owes us one.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday is the seventh day of the week.
Are you jealous?
I can't let myself be alone.
Give me the whole thing, please.
More coffee, please.
He was the first guy.
Thank you!
People were on the radio.
I'll get you a good chance.
Tom's gone into his quarantine with a dozen of his favorite friends.
NaF, it's so cool.
But I don't need anything.
Good night!
Look, a Japanese fried tree!
I understand.
Shut up.
I know your nose.
Good night.
Please answer.
I swear to God, Tom.
It's Tom.
I've seen this before.
The Khalifa Castle is the world's highest skyscraper today.
Are you out of here?
I can't wait.
Give me the whole thing?
I've got the wrong calendar.
Tom was singing.
There isn't any need to get one.
I've been working on one.
Get the doorman with you.
Where is the room?
Did Tom give it to me?
I'm sick of it.
It's a gift from Wagdalena.
This is my car.
I gotta go.
There are many people on the table.
Look, it's an asylum plant.
This is not a French question.
I want this thing.
They're still missing.
I want you to live with Getter Jaani.
That's great if he's gonna die his father.
Good night, Yukina.
It's not a joke.
There's a lot of shit in Brazil.
The language is black.
You're sure he is.
A song was sung.
Over there.
I'm sorry.
Thank you!
It's not the language.
Look, there's a tree here.
Dad wasn't home.
He's out of his mind.
Opened at the north end of the car area
You can't come here.
I need a phone call.
It's Tokyo.
You don't want Tom to be a savior like his father.
I got it.
You lost him again.
I've seen Tom do this.
He was a big man.
A filter has been inserted.
I like it.
Tom would have called the cops if he wanted him.
It's just a circus.
People are going home.
I'll keep going.
A guitar I'd like to get.
Filter fills my browser
Are you a Guarizius?
Watch out!
I'm sure I've done something like this every time.
Look at a red canvas.
I'm fine.
Sunglasses make me look good when I'm painting.
He's the only one who knows what's really happened.
Thank you very much.
Look, it's an accelerant tree.
Did you win?
I'm going to go before I'm almost ready.
Are you one of them?
How much is that?
A strong gel is waiting.
I live in Japan.
I'm not special.
Naf!
When were you born?
Tom's playing rugby.
Sunday's the last day of the week.
I'll hold on.
It's not my fault.
Look, it's a pink tree.
How long is this clock?
The language is white.
I'm deaf.
I've got questions to ask you yet.
The friend is doing things together.
I didn't mean to.
It's late.
I saw him running.
It's fine.
Tom wasn't in contact with Mary and John.
I understand.
It's cold.
I've been working for a while.
I love her.
It's Tom Rugby.
Thank you very much.
I see something.
Tom is in charge of making people do things for him.
Tom wins.
Tom's got a good idea.
You owe it to him!
I'm better off.
I gotta go.
Who's that?
Thank you.
Just white, please.
There's a box under the table.
That wasn't the kind of thing, was it?
Is that it?
That's nice of you.
Tom suffocated.
Think about it.
You're sure he is.
I don't like it.
I'm not working.
I'm done.
This movie was nice to Dom and Vari both.
I don't speak Spanish.
I'm done with the whole thing. Please give it to me.
I've got a pain in my ass.
Do you want to do it?
Yes.
That's the point.
One person's pockets are like a pimp's stick.
He's got a head inside him.
I need to finish my appointments
Did something wrong happen?
How are you?
I'm staying here.
Can you get AIDS against privacy issues?
I'd like to have a drink.
Where's the problem?
My legs are gone.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
You got the money?
I'm not gonna do that.
They're not listening.
I heard you.
Is Tom coming?
Only one language is not enough.
Have you ever been to Paris?
Tell me what you want to get.
Let's go. Let's go.
I've seen something.
Call the police.
I don't think so.
It's just games.
Tom didn't believe Mary when he told her she was in love with him.
I've lost my mind.
Tom liked to understand nomads.
I don't speak Japanese.
You hear me.
I know I'm sorry.
This is not a French question.
Where's Galleg's talk?
Empty garments do not have too many sizes
He's got one.
That's what I'm thinking.
You've been playing around ever since.
Thanks, Yukina.
Are you safe?
It was last time.
Invite to Paris.
I've come to fight.
You'd better not go.
There was an error.
I've lost my mind.
Thank you, my brother-in-law.
Where do you pray to Galleg?
He's here with me!
Are you sure?
I heard him coming out.
I'm sorry I lost my mind.
It's so cool.
One beer, please!
You've got everything.
Who's in here?
I'll be right back.
Look, there's a tree nearby.
Do you have two computers?
I'm a kid.
It's just art.
I don't care.
The king was jealous and he was obvious.
Do you speak Japanese?
I'm trying to expose English.
Are you jealous?
I don't know.
You're not such a big mistake.
You're not such a big mistake.
I'm not working.
Oh, my God.
I know about Tom.
Have you ever been to Paris?
I didn't take any boxes.
One of them's working.
NaF, what?
I haven't heard.
Are you out of your mind?
How much does it cost?
I'm not tired.
Thank you!
I didn't take any snacks.
I'll take care of you.
Have you seen a big link?
Tom is not a student, he's one of the scholars
I can't go home any more and I'll be there before.
Look, it's adenium.
That's the three of them.
Look, a report.
How long has this watch been?
Being soft has a good quality at least - you expect a lot to win.
Can I have some coffee?
I've been hit by a crash.
She was a cop.
One's pocket is like a lunatic.
Where are you talking to Galleg?
There's a known language for the money.
Friends do things together.
Stay home.
I'd like you to think of yourself as a nebula.
I'd better die to be free.
I owe it to you.
NaF, it's so cool.
I'll take care of it.
That's not a phrase.
Good night!
The car's blue.
He's got a song.
Look, it's a good idea.
Thank you!
It's great and great.
I'm not waiting.
She's reading.
There's two pages.
Thank you, Yukina.
He was such a bitch.
You're doing your head in the cannon.
There's nothing to be spontaneous about.
How about Tom?
I remember this thing.
Get out of here.
One more cup of coffee, please.
Just get along with them.
Yes.
No, thank you.
And Tom did?
Tell me what you want to get.
I'm sure you didn't talk to me.
There's something I've seen.
This phrase is not a bug.
The car's blue.
One's working.
"What time is it?" "It's half an hour."
It didn't work.
Tom saved it.
I don't know.
I need another one.
Where are you going?
It's gonna rain.
He was a big guy.
Aonnik's Tom.
How much is this score?
I'd like to see you again.
Do you like it?
Where's he going?
There's a lot of honor.
It didn't work.
We need your friends.
Who gave you all the cookies?
He was three years old.
Go to school well.
Khalifa Castle is the world's highest skyscraper.
Tom's a loser.
Enclasses on-me.
Rugby and Tom.
I don't know what you're gonna say.
It's strange.
It's too late today.
He was a black man.
It's too far away.
I thought Tom was dead.
Did Tom give it to me?
Welcome to Tatoeba.
Thank you!
I'll do what I want!
That's the paour-du.
It's okay.
Look, it's a different tree.
I'll find you later.
It's a big deal.
Can you get AIDS against privacy issues?
