Foods due to European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the Eurozone was the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 eurozone countries, the price was higher than expected in November - after 2.6 percent in October an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
In contrast to the US, British, and Canadian notary bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the turnover. In their view, the increase in the price of raw materials and the slight decline in unemployment would favour the emergence of an inflation spiral.
The ECB seeks to keep the inflation rate below two per cent, or at least close to the two per cent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in the mill: inflation needs to be "corresponded" in order to exclude subsequent action needs.
By 3.3 percent, the rate of inflation in November in Germany reached a 12-year recorddhoch; in Spain, the rate rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The increased food and energy prices are responsible for the rise in inflation in the euro area.
The MATIF weight ratings increased by 88 percent, and the Soya beans course also reached a record booth since 1973.
Food oil and milk products also suffered significant losses in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil increased by 52 per cent this year - in the past month, the price of black gold rose by nearly 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but it will fall by 1.9 per cent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts go from a 3-percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 per cent.
For 2008, experts estimate that the ECB will reduce interest twice.
Gallup faces government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathisers has grown significantly by the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has had the largest base camp, while according to Gallup, the consent for the Socialists has reached a level of 13 percent that has never existed.
The difference with the party voters is clearly due to the high determination of the opposition advocates: more than two thirds (71 percent) have a fifth (20 percent) agreement for the MSZP.
The MDFs and SZDSZ are said to be surveyed under the parliamentary inception rate: they come in the total population by two percent.
The number of party voters has increased by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last point, the general economic mood has continued to deteriorate - never before has the share of those who consider the country's economic situation to be "bad" so high (41 per cent), while another 46 per cent consider it "bad" to be.
With more hopeful prospects in the spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the next year, the majority of the population will face a further deterioration in the situation; only a decade will come from an improvement.
A Gallup survey carried out in December showed that 71% of respondents - a historic high - assessed the Prime Minister's work as "more bad than right".
Thirty percent of the respondents have great trust or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the proportion of the sponsors for Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
Around 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% suspicions against the head of the Fidesz party.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of those who think you could get the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister even without government change.
If 35% of the government and the head of government had spoken out of concern last October, this percentage is now only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) see the solution only in new elections.
Asked for their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would participate "in security", and another 20% would "probably" cast their vote.
In comparison, if Parliament's elections were to take place on Sunday, only 55 percent would go to the urinals, another 15% would hold their participation "probably".
74% would vote against the study fees, 79% against the practice fees, and 84% against the hospital bill.
According to the group, the shares of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would be even 81, 84, or 89 percent.
Auchan the most expensive, Tesco increases by almost a fifth
This year, the hypermarkets in the Buda’s trading area have also maintained the average price increase of 16% of the last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article from Napi Mydság
The price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Nappi" has also increased by 16 percent this year in Buda’s trade triangle, but price increases of over 1,000 HUF have been recorded in all hypermarkets.
After the prices in the food markets have been 'davongagloped' in last December, the prices have not fallen by a percentage, compared to the high, earlier level of output.
However, it certainly seems frightening to consumers that what they had paid for in the last year much less than 9,000 HUF is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Nappi" shopping cart exceeds the magic 10,000-HUF limit of at least 91 HUF in the investigated markets.
The highest price was 10.573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6.800 HUF.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at year-old levels, but prices for Putenbrush, Nuss and Mohn have increased significantly.
Prices for flour and bread correspond to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there were 1kg of bread for 139 Forint.
There was no competitive price change in the product at less than 200 Forint.
Also surprising here was the price of a two litre Coca-Cola bottle of under 200 forint, so the drink included Pfand only 257 HUF.
However, this year in the "Nappi" shopping cart comparison Auchan cut off the most expensive, and Cora cut off the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased prices in the "Nappi" shopping basket compared to Christmas prices last year by 15, while Tesco and Auchan increased by 18 percent each.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of this year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart of the last year and the most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480,00 HUF.
The average price increase was still at 1,206.00 forint in the previous year, but the increase in VAT at the last Christmas prices was notable.
That is exactly what the trade has been doing: it seems that the warehouses were not able to decide exactly what price range they should apply to the individual articles, since the effects of the increase in prices on consumer behaviour were invisible.
(If the trader plans the turnover of a product bad, he may fall for substantial gains in the price range which is based on the traffic intensity.)
The price difference in the price of the "Nappi" basket fell radically last year so that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forint, whereas the price difference in the cheapest basket was only 844 forint.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket at 1.630,00 Forint cost more than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price increase of 1.284,00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas season, a catastrophic price increase was shown, the price of daily consumer goods in the hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(In addition, this does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: In some basic foods, the Statistical Office established a more than 30 per cent increase over a 12-month period.
So in about next to flour also in eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Nappi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible in the latter case, as the price level of the product already expensive in the previous year has increased by almost 10 percent in the worst case.
Apparently, messengers are in a stronger position than the oil suppliers - however, they were able to deny the drastic price increase on the multiples.
In the golden trade triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is constantly reported by good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three stores are no longer looking at the prices.
It is bought from all large quantities, durable food goes into pallets over the shop.
Wednesday morning morning morning, there were endless snakes in all three stores at the Kassa, when the number of customers exploded.
However, the country reports a lower frequency of customers, so that many people are complaining about the opinion researchers, they could not even reach the planned turnover, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Variety is saved by disinfectants
Today, more than a thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals that were due to inappropriate treatment with antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overlap of beds, the overload of staff - all factors that are not directly relevant to the onset of infections, so the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Various sites are also saved by disinfectants.
In the traumatology department of the János Hospital, a MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant bacteria were found in a male patient who was delivered to the hospital after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was a similar infection here.
The injury of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but shortly thereafter the man had to return with a MRSA infection. An important operation since then could not be performed due to the bacteria that are still in the patient's body.
By December 10 this year, infections caused by multi-resistant miscarriage were reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Centre, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant error were registered in hospitals with safety, but the number of darks may be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, which is caused by staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
The staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about one third of the people in their nose without causing any disease.
SA-conditioned infections (such as throat inflammation, mandelitis, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well healthy.
However, if the means are too high or used inadvertently, they are produced from the well-responsive bacteria antibiotics that spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
In particular, in patients with weak, or permanently poorly functioning immune system, but also in older, or with low body weight, these bacteria can cause severe infections such as Wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of János Hospital, MRSA infection is nothing special, such events are part of the hospital day.
You must not mix the infection with the epidemic, warned Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA there is only where it is not sought.
Antibiotics Resistant
"such patients are isolated, the care staff wear rubber gloves and masks in the supply, and we have the antibiotics needed to treat" - said Tibor Nyulasi.
While patients are being examined for MRSA when they are in hospital, an infection cannot be avoided at all times.
Samples too rare
Most of the infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, however, the conditions and circumstances currently prevailing were unfavourable for preventing the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant breeder, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospital patients should investigate the patients submitted and isolate MRSA infected immediately.
However, in Hungarian hospitals, microbiological sampling is not so often practiced.
Not least because there is no subsidies on the part of the State Hospital.
Most cases therefore only come to the light of day if the patient already has a remarkable MRSA infection, the medical director of the epidemiology centre.
On the European Union side, there are strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but also in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, that is, microbiological studies are necessary in order to prevent resistance to the drug, however, this directive is not always complied with by hospitals.
Among the ambulances, or patients in basic care, microbiological sampling is even more rare, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Disposal of disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is transferred from one patient to the other by the most frequent maintenance staff.
That is why the washing of hands or the wearing of gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in the hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by foot-and-mouth infection or contact, but in the home hospitals there is not always the possibility of insulating the infected patients.
The rooms are often filled, the beds are hardly arranged, although from an epidemiological point of view there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately, in the less financially well-established hospitals, there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that favour the emergence of infections.
Such infections are proven to be far less frequent there, or the further spread of the predator can be stopped where these protective measures are being observed, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections in the grip results in enormous costs for sickness insurance, so they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its inhibition, was established in the government programme.
According to the first sign, the program is successful - as published evidence, the trend of MRSA infections in England is slow.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has identified the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant breeders (including MRSA), as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
Deadlinker police force was not drunk
In the case of the car accident caused by the police chief of the 21st district with a fatal outcome, the official opinion is now in place.
Attila Morvai, the chief of police in the 21st district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholized nor under drug influence, said the press spokesman of the Budapest Supreme Court on Friday, after the official opinion on the case was submitted.
The opinion confirmed the results of the first investigation, according to which the police officer had not consumed alcohol before he was taxed.
The former police officer book with his own PC in the XXII district into the Kossuth Lajos Straße and has passed over a 55-year-old who crossed the road to an unmarked place.
(StVO says this is not a mild condition, however - the linker has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the Zebra Strip, after all.)
The pedestrian is injured after being transferred to the hospital.
According to police reports, the anchor suffered a shock, then withdrew his functions and sought retirement.
The Budapest State Prosecutor has initiated its investigations into the case.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed three credit agreements worth EUR 400 million on Friday in Budapest.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects implemented with Cohesion Fund grants. The loan agreement was signed over 100 million earlier, in which the current agreement deals with the use of EUR 200 million.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement is also intended to cover the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the context of the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the Contracting Parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will flow mainly in research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the U-Bahnline 4 also came into the language.
It was agreed that as soon as Hungary has clarified the details of the EU's road financing, the original treaty and possible modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
Credit interest is linked to EURIBOR, the loan is made available by the EIB with an eight-year maturity free of commission.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - Europe as a whole is paying attention to the recently mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who buys the EU's even cheaper market, but becomes more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is no doubt the most desirable patch for real estate purchases in eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and houses on the sea.
Among the mountains, the regions include Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, the most popular ones on the sea are Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessable the riders, however property around Kavarna and Balcik are still being asked more and more.
According to estimates of Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, it is also intended to attract domestic investors sooner or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, as well as the prominent economic area of Russia, more buyers are listed.
The capital of Sofia also offers attractive offers - trade and office areas offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is the best way to become one of the most attractive European golf paradise, and thus to attract tourists in the two other seasons, in addition to the summer and winter season.
Therefore, prospective investors are already buying in a big style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who acquire properties in Bulgaria also seek to change their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also stakeholders from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and in the ski areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to retire buy either revitalized properties by 50-100,000 euros, or demolished houses by 5-15.000 euros, which they then renew themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are written large, but also the proximity to a major city, shops and doctors are crucial to the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday destination (Bulgaria was listed under the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group consists of business people who invest in medium to long-term value increases.
Real estates in the capital are becoming more expensive in the current way, due to the ever-increasing demand.
In the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the past five years there has been a price increase of 21 per cent annually.
The value of the real estate prices exceeds the increase of the fees.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Minister of the Environment Gábor Fodor announced, the experts meet at the end of Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 is continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries advise on the Bali Roadmap, which sets the emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
At present, there is a strong debate between industrial and development countries.
The United States has already signaled that it does not want to negotiate concrete figures, but would be ready to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major issue of the conference is whether the countries of industry are willing to support both financially and technologically, in addition to the reduction of emissions.
An agreement was also reached on the support of developing countries.
The adaptation fund signed by the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-capture Council, possibly at the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as is to be read in the "Piac es profit".
Hungary 6%
Minister of the Environment Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leadership in global climate protection measures and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that by 2020, the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% (in terms of 1990 values), whether or not the 2012 Agreement will be successful. The Union would even be ready to make use of a 30% reduction if other major industrial countries in the world, or developing countries, are also ready to comply with their obligations by force and responsibility.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the goal of the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was only 5.2 percent reduction, whereas the EU, with its 15 Member States at the time, had already committed itself to a 8% reduction.
The target for Hungary is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the years 1985-87 - a requirement that the country will fully meet, as is to be read in the Ministry of the Environment press release.
The use is high in Bali - however, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly enter into force only after 2012. In that case, the reduction projects set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new, international emission reduction system, which is also important for the IPCC, the international scientific climate change committee of the UN in its latest report, with the award of the Peace Prize.
This would delay the emission reduction, and the increase in the earth’s average temperature by more than 2°C would be inevitable, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army on YouTube
British Army units have published footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for the purpose of increasing popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) discovered YouTube for itself: Download special units stationed in Afghanistan since March 2006 videos about Taliban-led operations in the network, the BBC reports.
The footage shot by the Helmen Miniatur Cameras are controlled at the Kandahar Air Force Base and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Unavoidable political message
Air Force soldiers have already posted 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007, to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonware Office) and the international peace troops (MNFIs) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Employment in Afghanistan
The Air Force originally published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defence says, contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual objectives of foreign interventions.
This kind of propaganda was published almost free of charge in comparison to conventional television advertising, so defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, however, these videos always carry a certain amount of political message, as they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
American advertising with game
The army, however, must also fight against amateur footage, which, in addition to carefully processed, also create censored recordings in the network - such as those that show the death of soldiers: in some hooliganic, "official" propaganda films, the death of the highest is spoken of, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
From the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, many already turned-on videos have been uploaded to the platform, but these "gate" have only recently been discovered for themselves.
The Americans are buying something else, namely with the free downloadable shooting "American Army", in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less life-stricken simulation.
Christmas celebration with Tombola and Pogatsch in the Ministry
Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth is not shy: Instead of a Christmas celebration, she is organizing a work conference where her employees can make coffee and pogatische go out in 2007.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, other wonderful Christmas moods with tombola or attacks into the officials' hearts.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - so the power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already caught up with the officials.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry will be held today in the defence resort, but the employees of the Ministry will not be expected to do so.
At the "Way Night Festival" children are donated by fallen soldiers, at the "Mission Festival" family members are awarded by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides about 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other resorts, the National Agency for Development (NFC) and the Ministry for Economic and Transport on the strands.
The 4.32 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economy will be held in the house of the future, about 350 of the 600 employees will be expected.
The focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a Tombola release.
The National Agency for Development (NFC) held its 4.7 million forint expensive Christmas celebration at the House of the National Judicial Council (OIT) on Wednesday, with concerts and a feast.
The room rental amounted to 1 million forint, the rest was issued for the more than 400 guests loaded.
According to our information, an NFC department is also invited to another Christmas celebration organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
The building of the play theater ("Vígszínház") was rented for the festival.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information since we have not reached the competent authorities.
What's the suit for?
The ILO building was not only open to NFC guests, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the ILO for the use of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with an address from the Minister, after dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo] one reported: There was no ball dress or costume obligation at the ball.
The Ministry of Health, Labour, and Self-Administration are each preparing for a Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for employees in their own four walls for about 400,000 forums.
Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas celebration, but to the conference for the occasion of the year.
It is estimated that with about 180 guests, who - so the press department - are treated only with coffee and pogatsch, the festival will go out with 350,000 forint.
Minister of Self-Administrative Affairs Gordon Bajnai will only be attacked in the Department's Chamber with his colleagues.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas celebration in its own conference room to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenditure was measured with 2,500 forint per head - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent attacks.
Since the beginning of the time of János Veres, the PM employees celebrate this way each year.
However, there will not be a proper party vote - not only because of the Minister's official speech but also because the afternoon celebration was set up.
On 20 January, the Ministry of Agriculture invites a New Year's reception, this time the Ministry's Christmas celebration.
One hundred guests are asked to go to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the information of the resort, the expenses are estimated with 1,000 Forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be charged.
The receptions that are held each year are traditionally starting with a short address from the Minister and sounding like a withholding fragrance.
As the relevant press outlets report on [origo] demand, there will be no Christmas at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Education.
Asked for the cost of Christmas celebrations, there was no information in the Department of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the festival, which will be held in the Museum of Fine Arts.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League trade unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation form their coordination committee on Friday for the indefinite strike beginning on Monday.
A protest meeting will be held on Saturday, on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - the work begins.
It is calculated with strict, significant traffic barriers, as rail traffic is almost completely adjusted, and also the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) are closing until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be shared on Friday afternoon by the League of Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is also set up, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
A protest meeting will be held on Saturday, and from Monday all the organizations that have joined the strike will lay down the work for an indefinite period of time unless agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike on the day of Parliament's vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions shall withdraw the call for strike immediately.
However, if the law is adopted, the strike committees shall meet to discuss the further action.
Due to the National Council's agenda on Monday, it is even likely that it will come only in the late evening hours, or only at midnight to vote on the Health Insurance Act.
The strike beginning on Monday will have to take account of significant traffic barriers: the railways are putting down their work for an indefinite period, the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies remain silent on the morning.
At the same time, there will be a lot of roadblocks in a direction.
The call for strike is followed by numerous trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants is being updated on the Liga website on an ongoing basis.
Some organizations announced strikes at an indefinite time, while others plan a temporary downturn.
Until Thursday afternoon, between the Hungarian railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of the Railway VDSZZZ could not be reached agreement on sufficient services, although around the Christmas celebration more and more people are on the way.
According to previous reports, at the BKV from start of operations up to 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 p.m., the LIGA power and heat unions put down the work for four hours, and the teaching union, among other things, the democratic teaching union, called for 2 or 2-8 hours of strike.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors extends to different times across the country, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Forum for Cooperation of Trade Unions, has a two-hour warning call.
The most important of the four points required by the League is that the government takes back the draft for the reform of health insurance and submits a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will fall from next year.
Request number three states that the eligible occupational group will be allowed access to the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZZB of the League of Trade has not accepted the offer by the Ministry of Transport and is now calling for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard established in this August with the support of the "Moving for a Better Hungary" have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
The Institute's "risk warning report" includes: In relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is "strengthening the existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and the non-cigarette population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic clashes in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at the provocation of such opposition, as the Research Institute.
As reported, this will be seen as a failure by the political leaders: "People of public life have abandoned the discussion of the Roma question representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian opposition."
This is expected to strengthen the problem, make it impossible to engage in meaningful dialogue, favour extremes, and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts.
In addition, the research institute believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the domestic and foreign media, "the image of Hungary abroad has been severely damaged, especially with regard to confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary has been continuously underway, so that since summer 2007, several organizations called the "national Self-Defence Association" have been established.
"It is common for these groups to define themselves as a civil organization each while they openly boast of preparing their members for defence tasks (catastrophe protection, national defence, law enforcement), calling for the inadvertentness of the police, the army, or the state itself," it said.
And further: all this is done in accordance with the method that seeks to make different political and party-based efforts as a citizen initiative.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of association is therefore not just the conversion of legal barriers that could occur during the proceedings before the Court - it is a political strategy at the same time.
As the analysis is to be taken, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-increasing factor in relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, so some ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see in the formation of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of its own anti-Hungarian policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region."
From the point of view of the Institute of Research, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not an individual phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region is growing.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose foundation was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the rise of the Bulgarian Guard, the Roma mass expansions took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the opportunity to establish the National Guard, with the argument that the aim of the organization of "national protection" was to create the National Guard.
In your opinion, in the past 17 years, a regular "cigeunerterror" has been felt in Bulgaria, but the state has remained silent and indifferent - so political capital.
And further: the initiative would have left a strong debate in the Bulgarian public.
As it is said, the increased risk of ethnic conflicts is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to establish their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not to be excluded that the Hungarian Roma are also responding to threats by organising their own protection, the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Director of Research at Political Capital, said at the request of the News Office: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
Annual risk analysis reports would be published, and trends in risk change should be recognised, the public opinion will be informed, as in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere
In Hungary, holidays are regulated by law, so that the practice of re-disposing working days around the holiday has now been established, however, less days will be protected in the coming year.
In the EU and in America, you also understand something else under "Faerday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and working days.
Working days are usually religious holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are working days - the latter alone so that the Silver Festivals can rest.
Throughout the year, we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The State Festival is the 15th March, which commemorates the Revolution of 1848, and the 23rd October, the Memorial of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20th, the state foundation, on May 1st, is celebrated, on November 1 and 2nd, we remember our death.
In addition, there are every two holidays to Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "working days shifting" has proved in cases where we would work only one day before or after the holiday.
However, the price of extended weekends is that we work very well on Saturdays before, or have to go to school.
If this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is finally to be finalized, it shall be laid down by the Minister of Labour in his own Regulation for many years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employers, to public employees and officials of the public service.
Only companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. on holidays, are exempted.
Today, the working order will only be brought about by the holiday at the end of the year: from 24 December, life will remain formal in this country, since most days between Christmas and Silver will be equal to time, or the holiday that has been cancelled for this purpose.
The following year more holidays fall in the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so that there will be less redistributions in working days than this year.
The calendar is first placed around the day of work "on the head", so that people can stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day so that Friday, May 2nd will be a rest day.
The second re-disposition is linked to the holiday on October 23rd: on Saturday, October 18th, you will have to prepare on Friday, October 24th.
The end of the year, however, will remain unresolved in the sign of the holiday, after the 24th of December everything lies and remains, even if Silver falls on a Wednesday.
Six fearsome small things to upset workmates
E-mails that we forget to send, language messages that we never get - harmless lies that don't even happen to us anymore: they bring "color" in everyday life at the workplace.
The question is whether to get used to these small inconveniences, or to get better off the challenge, and try to avoid this misunderstanding, deliberately for other angry situations.
Tipps.
"Sorry, I forgot to let you know that someone called from the marketing department" - says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting with that?
Best of all, you regret it and try to make it good by calling the marketing department and perhaps being shy, you would have forgotten to forward the message (this is the less common method).
It's usually done with an apology.
Before you squeezing yourself in painful speech, you should think about how you can prepare your colleagues for a truly unpleasant moment and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Loan something that doesn't belong to one's own?
There's hardly anything more nervous than when you pick up a document, office supplies, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the lift was still on the desk - today it's gone early?
Or is the lost handwriting discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without asking, you should not borrow anything from your colleagues, because they are right-wing if they find that something has gone away.
So, don't put envelopes or post-it out of the office in the bag, because it could meet one of its own: no more if you need it urgently.
Are you talking about the privacy of your colleagues?
There is no effective means to stop a tratch that has already been put into the world.
Who's with who, what's he doing?
Where and why?
The information (or suspicions) on the privacy of colleagues should not be tied to the nose as far as possible!
And if anyone opens up and betrays his inner secret to us, we should not abuse this trust!
It is best to hesitate as a grave instead of pointing out to the non-representatives, even if others also know about the problems of the colleague.
No reason for the disease reported?
If you call in the office to report to you in calling for painful headaches because you just feel uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be clear about one thing: your own work, irreplaceable excuses, projects with fixed dates now have to be carried out by colleagues instead of yourself.
So don't play bad with your colleague!
If you already know that you will not create it in the office the next day, or that something might happen between you, why you have to stay home, you should report it in time so that neither colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Total, Faces, Phones
You have just been deepened in your work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud gecko of the colleagues?
Did you want to hear a phone conversation that you shouldn't have heard better?
You shouldn't get your colleagues to be nervous about sums, songs, loud talks (which you're driving over their heads), twitching, constantly snorkeling or noodles.
All of this can be very disturbing, even though they are not exactly in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Is it always the other guys' fault?
If a project is not completed within a time limit, if you forget to send an important letter or important messages, you should not look for the fault of your own forgetfulness to others!
If possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
For the best, you will make your mistakes, and you will apologize if others have been affected!
The question of how to make the mistake good again, or how to repeat the mistake, is just too much!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Training pants and sleeping: Comfortable for home, but has lost nothing in the office!
Not even then should one dress so much worse if it actually allowed the workplace!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect your colleagues as well as yourself so much that you dress in the office accordingly - if you wish, also nice and elegant!
Everyone wants to make it right - or how to become uninterested for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning.
The radio produces a rare melody: the sound of a soul, paired with electronic effects.
I'll turn the volume up.
The pace changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It's the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which turns out to be Mr.2.
The home music scene has not for a long time just missed us with a qualitative electrotropic.
But now you even see the statue differently when you hear the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the home digital underground scene slowly contribute to a change in the overall picture, and even if the Garagenrock with its guitar racequite is again "in", the home electrotrop proves: There are new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, himself musicd in the band Yonderboi, before he - perhaps because a hostel does not have two peppers - began to spoil his own way.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which melts elements from Jazz, Electronic, and Pop, but only when he was asked to compose the soundtrack into a film came to him (e.g.
"season" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which was first staged in smaller clubs, was only known to the wider audience when the magazine "wan2" chose its first album from 2002 under the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, shorted almost the only marketable trend set in the West.
There was no doubt that Zagar and his band were "trendy", but it was not interested in whether they also liked to carry this brand.
The band reacted as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album now published with the title "Cananot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new ways for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécs.
The expression comes from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the way with another band.
The airy, flying play would also be fine, however, alongside the essential character of music, the louder guitar, the influences of the rock'n'roll, which correspond to the spirit of time and trend.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere in the Millennium.
A song from the album has even made it a radio game - since the latest from early on to late on pop music, Mr.2 Pet whoso sent it to the audience with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six domestic singers ("underground Divas"), successfully put the earworm.
All right, then (?).
The hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: How far is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "schichtmusic" does not mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so, the so-called alternative or underground music can be soft and non-satisfying, but it can also be produced only for the sale that makes it commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The audience's reception is also functioning independently of language and country boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience of your music?
B. Zs.: In the foreign world, especially in the western part of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
Not only do teenagers or Twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They pursue the trends in pop music that pass around them, much more attentive, because they also hold them for a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important, who, where, how many of your music are listening to?
B. Zs.: Of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we've never composed for the market.
With us, music does not come to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the public is most noticeable in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but there is, in turn, only in the unimaginable changes of the moment.
However, one thing has happened to me: If you want to make it right, you are no longer interested.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on his way as a soloist and has built his career in the West.
B. Zs.: We are not really going his way, apart from the fact that you are always trying to interpret this into our music.
We see ourselves as a teamplayer who trust in the musical presence of the other and let them unfold.
At first, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came out of his band and took another route.
hvg.hu: "Wings of Love" is the first one in the charts of Mr.2 Pet
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this issue.
Was the opening with a slightly more popular style consciously staged towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We didn't have plans to write a hit that would then be held as a train for the album.
This song is about more.
It was thought to be the finals of the album, with which we wanted to solve the sound system and the more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why did she just say what the guiding principle was?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of bringing together the chorus from the soloists of the home music scene.
This is how the six-headed choir came into being - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik年 Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized "underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song the same, or did you design the girls?
B. Zs.: The number was already in the instrumental version, but when the material was finished for the album, we thought this number was "something else".
The accord sequence has formally demanded a voice.
I got the melodies on the same night, and later they learned the girls.
It came all practically on purpose and frighteningly spontaneous.
I can remember, I was pretty electrical at the time, but it's already been the "Divas" thing.
With my voice alone, the song would never become so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert one had the impression that the girls would be in the background.
There is no solo party (except the short solo by Judy Jay), they have no own role, they sing perfectly together and are not louder than the music, so their song is not just accompanied by music.
They were also at the stage behind them.
Is it intention?
B.Z.: The fact that they stood behind was because of purely technical problems.
However, we did not want to let them get any solo rolls.
The number also means that one should forget his ego a little, forget who came here and where he was on the way, let us simply let these certain birds push the wings of love.
I'd like others to feel this euphoric state that we've felt when the song was created.
hvg.hu: What was the most expensive song?
B. Zs.: In fact, nothing has been done in the musical creation work, but there have been more difficult tasks in mixing.
For example, at "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I play on a concert piano, or at "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the Groove no longer wanted to work, but after and after everything has joined up like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: This is changing with the concerts and also now, where I have the album "losgelassen".
Currently it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Swindler risked billions due to feelings of inferiority
Ungrounded fraud
Thus, his former employee Jerome Kerviel of the French banking company Société Générale, owner of this commercial bank.
It came for almost five billion euros.
But it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do the same to his colleagues, and certainly was not incapacitated.
Unlike all large banking houses, he soon recognized the crisis on the American mortgage market.
"He is psychologically weak," was heard from the mouth of his superiors who showed him at the police station.
However, as is evident from Kerviels' statements published by the French media, such as the Le Monde daily newspaper, he was a man who had achieved a profit of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year's business.
Crisis Not Just in America
"All I wanted was to earn money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros just in the US crisis.
The opportunity to do so had already come to an end in the beginning of the year.
In February, the first news was that so-called Sub-Prime mortgages, such as they poor customers or those who had earlier payment problems, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and kept it right.
At the end of the year, he had won up to 1.6 billion euros.
"Even when I earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kerviel adds, saying that he certainly kept nothing for himself.
During the entire hearing, he adds that he has faked documents so that he cannot be brought to the court.
He even managed to lead his bosses behind the light, even though the Eurex stock exchange was increasingly interested in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to fly?
Not at all.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to develop his position gradually.
He joined the Société Generale in 2000, immediately after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was approximately $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never earn as much as others.
"When I first spoke in 2005, I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel told the investigation officers.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the shares of the Alliance, he earned a lot by placing half a billion euros on the London bombings to lose this title.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll let you win.
"It's like a snowball," he told the cops.
But the bosses apparently knew about everything, or they knew it.
"If I earn money, you close your eyes."
But then at the beginning of this year came the great blow.
One day he lost a billion euros.
In a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to compensate for this.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer a bank employee.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they get to him?
Suspectedly, he took a vacation.
"I only took four days from the previous year.
A maker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want to be seen in the cards," Kerviel said.
Czech Republic has the chance to come to 365 billion
The Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, allowing the Czech Republic to reach EUR 14 billion (approximately SEK 365 billion) in the coming years.
It is about half of the amount that can be obtained from Brussels from the Czech Republic in the years 2007 to 2013.
Some 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" program.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow in transport.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 per cent of the funds available to the Czech Republic from the Fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have over 90.8 billion next year.
The "Company and Innovation" programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to earn funds for innovative enterprises.
The companies will thus earn funding for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
The previous acquisition of EU funds by the Czech Republic is among the least successful among the new accession countries.
Nicaraguan Court confirms twenty-year prison sentences for presidents
An appeal court in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the twenty-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for 100 million dollars (approximately SEK 1.8 billion) because of financial fraud.
But later he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hazienda at the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state returns behind the grid is currently unclear, according to the news agency AP.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now be up to the prison officials whether he will be allowed to stay at home or whether he will have to go to prison.
A court stated four years ago that Alemán had regularly moved the government's money to foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts actually belonged to their relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money finally landed in a fund set up by Germany to finance its election campaign in 2001.
Budget is by
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget this government has designed and adopted by the majority of coalitions without support for the opposition.
The ČSSD (Social Democrats) has been approved for the current year because it was submitted by Minister Sobotka (of this party), and therefore ČSSD was unable to refuse it.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion for a resolution against the Government, nothing has been dramatic this time.
The House of Deputies appreciated this traditionally little respect, yet a very important law in all peace.
That's kind of paradox.
All governments begin and end with the individual chapters and posts of the budget, whether or not one of them likes it.
The budget is an essential part of the policy, but it is covered by the government's struggle for power and opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and that is why they devote more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than nurturing numbers.
The state budget for the past social democratic governments has been left with three weaknesses which cannot be eliminated by the budget for 2008 at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure that is compulsory by law, which is not only about pensions, but also about social spending, which has been decided last year by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (communists).
The second is the deficit budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third restriction is in the deficits of public finances, i.e. the deficits of the municipalities.
However, the biggest risk is not the government deficit.
This budget is under public control in some ways.
A real time bomb, however, is the municipal budget deficit.
Many mayors have given in order to obtain additional sources of investment, except for income from taxes, taxes and bank loans, often excessive debt claims by which they overcompensated their advisors.
In recent years, they have managed to pay off these debts by massive sales of shares of energy and other supply networks that they received in the course of privatisation from the State.
Now this source is already secured.
To the extent that we only hold to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
our economy has been going through a growth phase for a few years, as the rest of the world, whose ČSSD is famous for without delay.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, these governments owed the State even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more wisely than our Republic.
This is a huge damage that must be attributed primarily to the previous governments.
We are part of the countries that are at least at risk of poverty, as a global measure.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programmes, which have, unfortunately, been over-breathing to a huge extent in recent years.
Even if it has succeeded in eliminating some of the foolish populist expenditures adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if it does not come to a shift of the retirement age and to a pension reform, then virtually all policies in this country will end, and, just like who is in power, nothing will remain to him as pure administrators.
It is easy to exaggerate when it is said that it will then become officials of the ruling politicians who share most of the tax revenue mechanically on rent and social expenditure.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but it can only ensure that normal expenditure is spent on compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion kroner for 2008 would be completely superfluous if previous governments had not spent over the past ten years on what just happened.
If we do not want it really to become purely administrative officials from ruling politicians, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to accept taxes and charges in preparation for further reform laws.
Only these enable the gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to deal with the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Central Bank of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
In this way, more than $100 billion will reach the currency markets through auctions.
These auctions increase the interest rates that banks are willing to lend to each other.
For example, the US Fed sends 40 billion dollars to auction, another 24 makes it easy for the European and Swiss Central Bank.
It is the first time, following the attacks of 11 September, that the central banks of each country agree on a coordinated approach to combating the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties in the economy, so the growing lack of freely available capital that banks can lend," said Bernard Baumohl in a report to his customers from the consultancy company Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the USA from 65% to about 50%," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost around 60 billion dollars due to non-service loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
"The central banks must really be afraid of what can still happen when they decide to do so," said ABN Amro's chief economist Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks are afraid that if the banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, credit will become more expensive for their customers as well.
This would reduce consumption and reduce the American economy into a recession, possibly with effects on economic growth worldwide.
The central banks have decided to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate of London's interbank interest used in the lending of banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to lend each other money, although the central banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom had reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as another reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the Agency Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step of the central banks contributes to the heating of the crisis because it does not solve the basic problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: Ecologists debate is incredible
Global climate change is likely to harm most developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again spoke about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now focused on the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, No Green Planet", he said that the debates of the Ecologists were incredible.
Klaus said that not only the structure of the conference is unacceptable, which is a rare mix of government representatives and such non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompany them and the reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word-to-word work, which is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed in his presentation of his book that his topic was very important to him and that he was so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation, because "I often meet the cartoons of my views."
So now interested people could read his attitude unmistakably.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climate scientist, but he felt that he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
Finally, he is an academic, able to understand and evaluate professional negotiations, has experience with statistics, and is also a national economist.
As the main statement of the book, he referred to the fact that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus among the scientists on warming that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and thus no threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are overwhelming, excessive, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition, he held it as someone who had experience with totalitarian systems to impose on other unproven views, viewing it as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly stated that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and income."
Klaus had spoken about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600000 people were unable to exchange their driver's license
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driving licence, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day on which exchange can be applied for so that the authorities can create a new driving licence by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid of hundreds of thousands of drivers leaving the streets without valid driving rights after a year.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive have not changed their driving licence.
While small places report a strong decline in interest in the trade in lead, the offices of the capital are being transferred with applications, and the interest in exchange has grown this week.
The city administration makes about 2000 customers every day.
You have to stand for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140000 drivers have not changed their driving licence yet.
The exhibition is a new driving licence for 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shorter period of five days.
In this case, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who do not make the required exchange until the end of the year without a valid driver's license are threatened with a financial penalty from January.
The victim pays no more than 2,000 crowns.
However, the police can also use a reminder in the case of the offense.
In the case of an offence, the penalty may be increased to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, the person from the municipality may also be sentenced to a fine which is not at all carried out.
He could, as it were, threaten a punishment of even 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has already called on the officials to leave Milde to vacate and impose a fine of 1,000 crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one threatened a thousand crowns.
The driver's license is a document in which everyone can decide whether to own it or not.
It's not about a personal statement that everyone, and a valid one, must have.
People who don't want to drive should give their driver's license.
It is enough to bring him to the competent community or send him there by letter.
At the end of the year, licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will be invalid.
However, drivers have to exchange additional types of driving licences.
People with driver's licenses from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The validity of licences issued in 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are approximately 2.6 million additional driving licences.
Court of Justice lowers penalties for detectives associated with Berdych
The former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Konňarík, who are accused of having made a joint case with the band of David Berdych, received 13 respectively 10 years in prison.
In a legal judgment, the Supreme Court of Prague decided to reduce its sentence by two years.
Originally, the "Office for the Fight against Organized Crime" detectives were threatened 14 or 12 years ago.
Against the present judgment, there is no appeal, only revision is possible at the Supreme Court.
Berdych himself is accused in this matter, but first he stands before the judgment.
In other processes, however, he had already been punished for a total of 16 years.
He can't be convicted anymore.
In January 19 people were accused of being involved in robbery, and today the Oberlandesgericht negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants argued from the outset on the ground that it was a constructed case.
According to the medieval district court, members of the police in agreement with Berdych Crimean information from police sources, covered various thefts and helped members of the gang to withdraw from prosecution.
The band left Opava and Konňarík 30 percent of the profits.
The prosecution is a criminal offence of the gang between 1999 and 2001.
Especially in cases of theft, the victims of which often suffer serious injuries, but also in cases of official measurement and illegal possession of weapons.
In domestic investigations, the police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel cores, a laser target tube and a machine gun.
According to the prosecution, the gang has enriched itself with millions of crowns because of their theft.
With the exception of almost 20 men in this procedure, Berdych and a number of others have been legally found guilty of further theft.
Other men from Berdychs district must be responsible in another process, other cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The main negotiations have so far been held by Tomáš Póta and Maroš Šulaj, who are in Irish custody and are awaiting their final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchange - Account: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a decommissioned clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to ask for compensation from the hospital in Trebíč 12 million crowns plus court costs.
For every mother every three million, for the fathers every two million, and for the children every one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
Therefore, the representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, has not fully agreed with the proposal Velebas.
"We reject such a proposal because it is too high," said Dostál after today's negotiations.
"But in order to be able to give us an opinion on this counter proposal, we need the opinion that made the counter-proposal.
We'll find out if it's worth a statement at all.
But we believe that this should be for all in the hundreds of thousands," Dostál stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200000 kroner for each of the four parents.
At first, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for every month that she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, as the basis for compensation negotiations, an opinion that had been prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol was used.
The parents of children suffer from psychological and psychiatric damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depths, according to experts.
The men were better aware of the stress situation, even if they saw themselves face-to-face, they could have prevented the change of the newborns.
The women, in turn, are worse off with the consequences of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is just going on, Veleba's content.
Veronika and Nikola sold out nurses at the decommissioning clinic in Trebíč on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Chermáks in Primbyslavie, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the district chief of Vysočina (Böhmisch-Mārische) handed over every family of 100,000 crowns as a replacement for expenditures created by the error of the hospital in Trebíč, which is the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are covered by laws on the grounds of liability.
In the event of doubt, they must take up a reserve fund, only by way of exception they can apply for assistance from the carrier.
The courts have so far relatively low amounts of damage, the amounts have been determined by tables and have moved in the area of hundreds of thousands, with the exception of millions.
Polívka came around his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the battle around the brand "Kingdom Walachei".
According to Ostrava, the judge at the district court, he used the term "Walachic King" as the first one, but the project had built a team in long-term work on Tomáš Harabiš in conjunction with the actor.
Polivka did not participate in the negotiations today.
According to his lawyer, this is probably not the end of the matter and his mandate will probably be called in.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívkas parasitic," the lawyer said after the negotiations.
All presented themselves to these actors and comedians in the words "Walachisches Kingdom".
The same opinion is also Harabiš.
"We have almost ten years' work behind us.
Money acquisition and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the cause is a dispute over money.
"After years they found out that the project was successful and that they could also have something of it.
They want to win parasitic on our work," he continued.
Lurative business
According to the court, Polívka used the term "Walachic King" for the first time in one of his television broadcasts.
In 1993, he was co-founded by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
But that did not go along with the intention of justifying a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came to think of giving wave passes.
From a fun action originally crystallized a business and a business activity, which joined Harabiš then the establishment of the company "Walachisches recherche".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to the use of his name and signature in the plays and even offered to its owners reductions when visiting his farm and theatre presentations.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Haraviš only used the simple idea that Polívka had made public in the "Manege" mission for his business purposes.
"The popularity of Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the Welsh Kingdom," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project Harabiš and his team were devoted to him.
The cooperation of the parties currently in question lasted until 2000, when Harabiš for Polívka in Vsetín organised the official crown.
Since then, however, the disputes between Polívka and Harabiš have begun to clash, which culminated in the phrase "King Boleslavs I. chosen until the day of the Sankt-Nimmerleins".
The leadership role then took place at Harabiš's Jarmila Šuláková as queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, which was rejected by the Court today.
Clearness in the dispute could bring the battle prepared by Harabiš around the throne and half a princess.
A new king should come out of this.
He didn't want to betray details and an appointment yet.
"We don't want to miss anything.
It's supposed to be something like the king's ride in the Waliman.
The king should be elected for a certain time.
Mr. Polívka can also log in quietly," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: spare parts
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
His driving characteristics were not very valuable, the quality of walking, driving and also processing could be described as more than on average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and he is much better.
The combo with the name SW is still a piece, and I just want to review my opinion.
When I had tested the classic Hatchback of 207, for example, I had to complain about the lack of freedom of the head on the back.
These complaints are no longer available, because the body of the van is so designed that no two-meter men will suffer.
Move forward
I'm just going through the interior just so I don't have to repeat myself too much.
This is a very successful design, where I have to argue only because of the careful middle tunnel.
There I would welcome some more design design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times are over, where we may complain about too short seats or head restraints.
The content of the page has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
With regard to the room offer, you can also see here the larger dimensions of the body.
In the van the already mentioned deficiency of head freedom is also eliminated.
Cache in the cached space
The main thing about this car is the cargo room.
I have to call it (also because of the climbing back window) very well-charged and space-saving.
The rooms are equipped with hooves that represent an ideal compromise.
They don't interfere, they can separate, and they can also hold heavy objects.
But let's talk about the volume of charge.
It is according to the table in the basic equipment 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to competition.
However, not compared to the most sold vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the peugeot remains at 52 litres clearly visible.
This value is already critical for a vacation abroad or when inviting a child's car.
But in order to highlight the positive, I still have to mention the very flat cargo room or the very low cargoe.
120 PS in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-wheel petrol engine with a hub of 1.6 litres and a power of 88 kWp.
And frankly, it should look like a 1600-cubic engine that drives a family hatchback.
He's quiet, he's got a low consumption and he's taking off well.
If I compare him to his opponent at Škoda, who sometimes seems to be hiding his exuberance with a pencil, then I can only be thrilled by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly national.
But we must remember that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine of 329900 crowns is still high.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car is once again to be booked with 80,000 crowns.
However, we had headlight bags, automatic air conditioning, automatic disc wiper, electrical window lifts and...
The car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
That's a lot, but once you calculate the additional equipment of a fabia and you will arrive at a similar sum.
So only the choice remains which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak students in British schools failed
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries increases, which in the case of the indigenous fears of further development of the local school system.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far been hampered by a number of obstacles.
British schools even identify cases where disputes between immigrants and children of the original residents increase in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is illustrated by the case of North Kent, where conflicts between native and Slovak immigrants are increasing steadily.
Struggles, sketches and scraps among students have been transferred to the relationship between parents.
The situation has developed so far that the police in Chatham found a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused argued that the boy had affected her with racist attacks.
The police also had to intervene on a Slovak immigrant after a two-year-old attack.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks against the man and thrown him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed a bus house and spit on us.
When I told him he was going to stop, he dumped us with apples and beers and then blew off his seat," a mother of Slovak students in The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals referred to the struggle with the immigrants from Eastern Europe even as a survival struggle.
The above evidence shows that the mood between natives and immigrants in British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In the United Kingdom, 70,000 Slovaks were reported who came here for work.
Some 30,000 Slovak students then visit British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect of your holiday will be fulfilled if you just choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is as quiet as a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with cellars offering on the beach pizza, ice and disturbing cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find it to a large extent.
But only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by a human eye.
Havana was once a warehouse or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had stolen in America and then transported to Europe.
And then the American epoch came.
The Hotel Nacional was created at the end of the 20th century.
Building it was one of the leaders of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during the ban) was seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high houses grew over the broad boulevards of cars, which included the cult symbols of the fifty years of the past century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havanas, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional mixt you have cocktails all the way to wish.
And the cult cars of the fifty go around Havana to this day, because the once imported Schiglis and Fiats have been in the salty and wet air for a long time.
May Havana, especially his oldest part, have come down strong, nowhere in the area is there as many wonderful colonial sights as just here.
Other places are just thrown out, such as Trinidad.
In view of the urgent need for tourism, there was a green light for this development.
In the last 15 years, new hotels have been created not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of Holguín Province and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba also offers a marathon that is unique in the world and attracts mainly railway lovers.
The sugar tube from remote plantations brought steam and the same operated narrow-tracks to the sugar factories.
Their car park has not been renovated for decades, so you can see powerful and fully functioning locomotives, whose age colleagues are standing in the museum for the longest time.
Expulsion targets
Most important places do not leave the majority of visitors in Cuba.
So you don't have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail anymore.
It remains to be mentioned that in Hemingway's already mentioned assets there is a museum whose visit should not be allowed to go away from those who like this writer.
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corner of Cuba.
The amazing vegetation grows on limestone.
The Mogotas, limestone and rock, rise from the valley floor, in its caves, collected fertile soils, through which also welded rocky areas are covered by dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him if you visit one of Havana’s cigarette factories.
It may also seem interesting that the Chilean consequences of the "Mayor Zeman" TV series were turned around there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was established shortly after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Rum and wealth brought her the trade with slaves and sugar.
The richness was embedded in the beautiful beauty of the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has barely changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that in the last fifty years there was no road that would have connected the area to the rest of the country.
This isolation contributed to the lack of attention.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing destroyed, everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the "Tal of Sugar Factorys".
In the evening you should go to the Casa de la Música, which lives after the darkness, and where the music does not fade until the morning.
Baracoa
These cities all the way to the East of Cuba are sometimes called the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both streets leading by Guantánamo there must surpass high and steep mountains and go through a landscape that is barely affected by human intervention.
This eastern preposterous Cuba took UNESCO into its world heritage directory thanks to its unaffected nature.
There the best chocolate is produced, in which the church shows the cross of Columbus (in fact it was created about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the present Hotel El Castillo, stands, are several tablestops, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the room, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain, the pigbukt and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana Cabaret, the holiness of Cuban patronine Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion that recognizes the descendants of slaves, about all that many pages could be written.
But, as you say, look better with your own eyes.
United in Afghanistan are passive, alleged Americans.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the United States according to the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should develop a concrete plan for the coming years, according to Defence Minister Robert Gates.
The mission in Afghanistan did not go according to its ideas, about which the representatives of the countries in Scotland agreed to have stationed units in the south of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban side, the eight participating States are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its defence minister Robert Gates, calls on NATO units to become more active, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
"In Afghanistan, progress is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable citizens to start a further development of the economy and security," says British Defence Minister Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety-five percent
The activities of the Afghan rebels have reached the highest level, according to the US Army, for five years.
The number of acts of violence has increased by 27 per cent compared to the previous year, even by 60 per cent in the southern province of Helmand.
The NATO countries have stationed some 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the alliances have reached an absolute limit as regards the organization and equipment of the units.
In particular, they call for further helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We will seriously have to think about the concrete goals for the next time and how we can achieve them," Gates said.
Similarly today, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop spoke.
"I am not happy about what we have available in Afghanistan to countries and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," said De Hoop of the Reuters Agency to complete three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the participating countries, there has been a dispute over whether all the allies in Afghanistan are giving their best in the past few months.
For example, due to its liabilities, Germany has been criticised.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
This week, the British Boulevard newspaper "Sun" referred to German soldiers as falulves.
"Afghanian Non-Student Away: The Germans make games while our boys fight," wrote the "Sun" in a contribution that was supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper went against the attack and printed a picture of a British unit in a Rugby competition in southern Afghanistan.
Public debt will rise to one billion in 2009
In each Czech country, there is a government debt of 84,000 kroner.
Total debt rose to SEK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
The government had planned to owe 159.2 billion wives this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of state budget policies.
The government debt of the Czech Republic rose to SEK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
Within the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its statement of public debt from the beginning of October.
On each of the Czechs, a debt of 84,000 crowns is paid.
Over the last year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"To date, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we will perhaps exceed the limit of a Billion Krone in 2009 only.
The next year, the debt should move between 900 billion and a billion crowns," said David Marek, an analyst of Patria Finance, to the iHNed.cz server.
Similarly, Vladimir Pikora, an analyst of the Next Finance, sees it: "To exceed a bill we could come in the course of 2009.
If that is the case, it depends on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it should show that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, it could last until 2010.
But I am not going out of such a change," he noted.
Increased debt
The government debt stems from the government's debts and comes mainly from the accumulation of government deficits.
Public debt is financed by securities, public debt securities, direct bonds or, for example, by the European Investment Bank.
This year's domestic debt rose to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state's foreign debt has now increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable state debt reached the end of September 803.3 billion crowns and fell by 13.7 billion since June.
The average rate of government debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt rose by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really much in view of how good the economy is.
It is interesting that growth is primarily to be recorded in debt securities, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debts are rising, but on the other hand this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," Pikora commented on the data.
Better Than Expected
The financing strategy and the treatment of government debts for 2007 show that the government had planned to raise SEK 159.2 billion for this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to $152.8 billion thanks to the better development of public budget policies.
This amount is mainly due to the government deficit, which will obviously reach $76 billion this year instead of the estimated $91.3 billion.
This is also the maximum planned funding for the consolidation agency of SEK 13.3 billion, a ten-billion reserve for the payment of the pension, the financing of government debt claims for 43 billion and the interest rate for the European Investment Bank's bonds of 1.8 billion.
For giving a Teddybaryn a name, she was brought before a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, accused in Sudan of insulting Islam, was sentenced on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days of imprisonment and subsequent expulsion.
The British was accused of having allowed six to seven years of students to give a Teddybary the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She would've deserved to be pissed off.
After several times the parents of students had complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old elementary school teacher who was working at the Unity High School of Khartoum was arrested at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Law.
In fact, this matter takes its start in September when the teacher invites her six to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the classeddy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports schoolmaster Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class agrees, 20 of 23 children will choose Mohammed as their favorite names.
Surely, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the image signature My name is Mohammed .
The bear itself did not bear a sign with this name, but the problem is simply that the representation of the Islamic prophet is viewed as insulting Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who taught at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew her well, and she would never have done anything to bring her closer to a religious faith, I just regret that she had asked the children to vote for a name, in his opinion it was just an innocent mistake.
An opinion shared by many of the teachers, who describe them as very attentive to their students and as a person who never talks in the class about religion.
It is recalled that at the same time, the first name Mohammed is the second most common name given in Britain, for which there are 14 different writing methods in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered to be a kind of service to the prophets (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But how do the rules apply to the use of this name?
Can you, for example, give him a toy?
This, of course, is a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, at the last negotiating meeting in Vienna, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and last discussion session on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversy about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not agree on the status of the party, European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger explained at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that the peace in the region was at stake, the American counterpart Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina called on them to fulfil their commitments to preserve peace, and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and indicated that there are quite clear tensions.
End of tenders on 10 December
Troika's mediators, who unite the European Union, the US and Russia, will meet on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo for the last time.
The future of the province inhabited by Albanian speakers could be clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submitted their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiating meeting since August of the UN called for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mission to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked Kosovo's independence from the Security Council, are continuing negotiations beyond that deadline.
Russia was and remains advocate of a negotiated solution, a compatible solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After Kosovo has been under UN administration for eight years, the Western countries maintain the EU's independence under EU supervision for the only solution in the future.
Pristina is willing to announce this unilaterally if the Security Council should not decide on their merits.
Belgrade is based on stronger autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the President of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the Hotel in Baden, where these last chance negotiations have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regret.
However , he added that the plan proposed by Belgrade belongs to the autonomy of a past leading to murders and deportations .
Domino-Effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic felt that a compromise should always be sought, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly looking for a "domino effect" in a region that is still so much weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision would be taken only and alone in the Security Council, where their Russian allies had a veto right.
Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only one decision of the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.
The journalist Fatmir Sejdiu replied that the Kosovo Parliament would have the last word of status and added that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking people would be in agreement with the Western countries.
Bush draws an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which had been held on Tuesday under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to begin negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two nations.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them to conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians have to destroy the terrorist infrastructures and Israel has to stop its colonization work, Bush explained, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the roadmap for the peace that they had agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas at the end of the last year should seek a peace treaty, which should clarify all open issues without exception, including the central issues.
This term includes the three major problems that are facing the disputes between Israel and the Palestinians mainly: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees, who were driven out of their homeland in the course of the 1948 conflict in the present state of Israel.
After the US President Abbas took the floor and insisted that the upcoming negotiations be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide a system for all points, including Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the word on his side, he committed himself to conducting the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations directly and without interruption and to trying to bring them to an end by the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of his vision of two states , a Palestinian and an Israeli who existed alongside each other at the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has received an assurance from Bush in this sense of Bush before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has led a plan taken by all Arab countries to offer peace to Israel, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the war in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a milestone in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi Arab prince in his interview is referring to the Arabic-language newspaper funded by Saudi money.
According to the state attorney, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this kind of local news, official versions and rumors are facing.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first findings of the National Police Disciplinary Authority (IGPN), a police car took place on Sunday, shortly after 5:00 p.m., at Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no use, but was on strips, and drove with 40-50 km/h, without bluelight, explains a spokesperson of the police.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without permission, so not released for public road transport (see below), came, controlled by two young people without helmet, with very high speed.
It hit the left side of the police car after it missed its move from the right, a police officer continued.
The alcohol checks carried out on the vehicle passengers are very negative.
The condition of the car (pre-flighted chicken, split wind protection disc, broken trunk) is evidenced by the suspense of the spray.
Very fast, already yesterday morning, the state attorney of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an opinion on the "Facts of the Involuntary Murder and the Unhelpful to Persons at Risk", in accordance with the main direction for public security of Val-d`Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor explained that she excluded the responsibility of the police officers from investigating the IGPN at this stage.
According to the Magistrate, three witnesses of the incident that were heard on Sunday evening confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small power wheel had arrived relatively quickly on their left side.
Yesterday, a kind of tire was shown, surely caused by the friction of the treadmills on the ground that the two vehicles were stuck together until the police made it.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to a technical assessment.
The bodies of the two victims were abolished yesterday.
What happened next?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel quickly made a rumor that the police had left the crash site very quickly, and that without the help of the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very careful, it would also exclude any serious errors in this matter.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigations needed for further investigations, and one must take very careful action.
Libération has struck a glimpse of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows, he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to live her again, these witnesses tell us.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed cop who was gone.
Two others tried to relive one of the young, the fourth phoned.
In view of the tension that had quickly formed around the event and, as it seems, because of the certainty that the present people had had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen of colleagues who had encountered the accident were taken in the car.
Still, according to this testimony, the rescue forces met about twenty minutes after the police march.
They have also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police force had not helped young people.
This young man was first helped.
The firefight has arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, the prosecutor stressed it.
In Pakistan, the tension is rising
On Monday, the Pakistani police defeated the first demonstrations, since two days before General Musharraf was called out of the emergency.
According to the testimony, about 2,000 lawyers in Lahore city in the east of the country who demonstrated the damage to the gas grenades used there by the order forces were injured against the measures taken under the emergency.
Then they threw stones with which they injured the police.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested temporarily.
There were similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police lawyers attacked and injured.
Several would have been arrested temporarily.
In Islamabad, the prosecutors of the Court of Justice have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of approximately 500 arrests of opposition, human rights offenders and lawyers during the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked to prevent the assembly.
Other demonstrations had been held in Multan (Mitte) and Peshawar (Northeastern).
On Monday, the prosecution received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance Muttahida Miles-e-Amal, whose president called on the population to send flowers to the judges who had spoken against the situation and those who had left an oath before the Musharraf.
Musharraf's promises are no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to refer to the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct vote on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed and dismissed.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the Magistrate of The News explained.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to issue the Supreme Command over the Army and become a civilian president is no longer valid since the emergency call, the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem stated on Monday.
It was expected that he would give up his military uniform by 15 November, the date on which his first term of office would end as president.
The Deputy Minister of Information has also confirmed that January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denouncing the hard-earned rumors in the country, according to which President Musharraf had been granted a place of residence by his deputy leader.
More than a third of pregnancy is still not planned
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed the prohibition of reception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the different methods of prevention such as the pill or spirals still have a 5-6% reduction rate.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of pill users between 20 and 40 years of age who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of the prevention of reception has nevertheless allowed for better control of fertility.
In any case, eight of ten births were carefully planned today.
At one of five couples even calculated exactly on the month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the occupation of the International Space Station (ISS) will have spent more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector that is indispensable for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A waiting exit that, due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools built by the astronauts to perform the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem arose on Wednesday, when the astronauts had released the harmony module from the spacecraft Discovery, a large cylindrical part which was soon to take up the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratory.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the occupation was therefore to implement a 17.5 tonnes heavy module for electricity generation over solar collectors already on the ISS to bring it into its final position.
After she had moved it, the occupation took place to restructure the solar collectors of the module, whose span is 76 meters.
And then it happened that one of the collectors who were allowed to emerge like accordions was damaged by a tight cable on a length of about one meter.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector again.
The astronauts, who originally left space exploration for a check-in and then had to repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around to perform the repair at the end of the 30 meters long remote controlled arm of the space transport that was fitted to the station.
He's one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very suitable, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old physician was therefore selected to operate the injured solar collector.
After carefully observing the damage, he cut the faulty cable and fixed a kind of rail on the damaged site.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who remained near the castle, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the occupation.
The tool that he used to convert a mini-hockey blower into an insulator to prevent the solar collectors that create several hundred volts of electric blow, the astronauts on board the station had thought and built.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully exhausted before he counted his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon the astronauts enjoyed a half day of relaxation before seven astronauts returned to space transport Discovery today, likely to enter the return journey to Earth on Wednesday.
The title of EADS on the stock exchange is sanctioned
Following the announcement by the Air and Defence Group that it will have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and 1.4 billion in order to counter the A400M residues, the EADS share is currently showing a significant decline in the Paris Stock Exchange.
Currently, EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review once again its business forecasts for 2007, referring to the residues caused by the slow development of the engine of the A400M which delay the flight of the aircraft.
The costs announced in October to offset the delay in the delivery of their military aircraft amount to between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than one billion for Airbus, was announced by the European manufacturer EADS's parent companies.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007, in the presentation of its quarterly results on Thursday, he added without further detail.
The group also states that the assessment of the new costs is linked to the six-month period.
To remember, EADS’ business performance fell by 86% in 2006, largely due to the delay in another programme, the cost of the very large A380 carrier aircraft.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The status quo code for the top bar
On Sunday, it will not be exciting when you count the urns: the mass of the Russians will decide for President Putin's party, the United Russia.
After a very successful election, she confirms her quest for stability, even for authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a message to the voters, who have already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the Pro-Kreml party, for which he announces an overwhelming victory.
Yesterday, the President did not let anything out of sight when he received the foreign ambassadors, and he was pleased to provide a new attack on the Western powers accused of mixing - his favorite theme during the election.
We know the price of true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have left.
She's chasing a campaign of repression.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the repression of the demonstrations at the last weekend, ex-Schachweltmeister Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison, according to his lawyer's continued prohibition of visits.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections, there are two very important questions:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The Official Journal yesterday announced the date of the first election of the presidential elections on 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December time to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and was re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot succeed for a third term.
And now there's no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Will the President of the majority of Parliament and the All-powerful Party of the United Russia, the Government and the President be elected?
Whatever is going to be, in the parliamentary elections or in the presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
It's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not the Lord of their fate, according to sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Centre of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kokossov from the State University of St. Petersburg goes back even further: the bourgeois society in this country, which has been Christianized for five centuries to Europe, has only developed very slowly; the famous community spirit has slowed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin again linked to the model of a paternistic state, which was fully accepted by the population, more than ever, since this new paternism was not a terror, but a certain economic prosperity, Maria Lipman says of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians from free pieces reject the personal responsibility they have placed on the day after the collapse of the USSR.
How long do you think you've been thinking about?
This phenomenon concerns all the history of society, including the business world.
And the administrative unit understands how to keep the status quo: 65 Governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) represent the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new, coming freedoms from the West are often the same as chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Why do you think for a long time?
Those who are in authority are not such as to drive them away.
A Hard Think
After more than 60 years of confidential treatment, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the schicksales of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely available.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are stored at a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be viewed so far, unless it is with a humanitarian intent, that is, individually and by name, at the request of a former victim or of his family.
The eleven States with their administration, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed in May 2006 to make them available to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this Decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Helicopter Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow for research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the occupations of concentration camps and the health status of forced workers, says Reto Masters, head of this archive, managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, have been able to make these named documents available to the public on the basis of a number of information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The detention lists of concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo were brought together after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who were deported or subjected to forced labor, and perhaps to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their forgiveness.
Today, more than 300 fixed employees are still processing tens of thousands of personal requests in Bad Arolsen.
However, a part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
No fundamental new developments can be expected in these documents, said Pr. Wolfgang Benz, Head of the Research Centre for Anti-Semitism of the Technical University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India want a free trade agreement in 2008.
Today, trade between India and Europe is already at EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's main trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said that the European Union and India hope to sign a Free Trade Agreement in 2008.
The EU foreign ministers had given the European Commission a green light last April to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALEs) with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Aseans).
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will greatly advance the two economic areas and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million well-being Europeans, said Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products from India, the European Commissioner continued to declare. The Asian and European giants exchange goods of 47 billion euros each year and services worth 10 billion euros, Dåle Smadja, chairman of the European Commission's meeting in New Delhi, said this week, and regrets that the mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. The EU and India meet on Friday with their eight diplomats in New Delhi, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
The Bank of England expressed concern on Thursday about the current recurring dissatisfaction with credit conditions and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with unusual duration.
In order to mitigate the fears that the conditions on the financial market will be particularly hard at the end of the year and to provide the banks with greater certainty about the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions at that time, the Bank intends to provide a significant part of its savings in the maintenance phase beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks.
The Bank further states that on 6 December, around 12.15 GMT 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be converted into the basic tax rate and only until 10 January.
This is apparently the first time that the BoE runs liquids in an open-market operation for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its Communication that it is prepared to take further steps to obtain the different rates of interbank lending from day to day with its basic interest rate.
The different interbank interest rate from day to day was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has increased to 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the sums charged by the Bank of England have been linked to criminal charges that the banks had prevented them from taking into account.
According to certain rumors, strengthened by the development of the pound rate, in contrast to the euro, many were willing to sign up for the amounts put into circulation by the European Central Bank at more favourable interest rates and with a safe discretion.
UPP and NC refuse to review PS's proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
The text adopted by the National Committee of the PS on Wednesday (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group) contained about ten measures, which were adopted by the national committee on the basis of a 50% increase in employment, the re-introduction of the TipP fleet, a transport check or the limitation of rentals.
After the UPP and NC had voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which offered to some extent strong changes between the majority and opposition cause, several hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television contribution on purchasing power.
The president of the MPs, Jean Marc Ayrault, announced that his group would present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the draft law for the correction of the finances, which was examined last week by the Assembly.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous news about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the Promoter/Producer announces the Wineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no longer or less, served as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones from C3 shared with Bilboard.com.
C3 will host the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from August 8-10 on a 500 Acre large private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The leader of the Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most renowned festival producers.
In 1989 he took over the lead of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Ben added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also taken care of production, licensing concessions and organizational tasks of the Glasstonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, the Glasstonbury, describes as the most inspiring event in which he has ever been, says that his company and that of Melvin Ben work side by side to offer the area a festival event in a European style.
We have chosen Philadelphia as the market and work zealously with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, Charlie Jones says.
We conducted negotiations in the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
Unfortunately, we have remained in police debates regarding the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Happyly, we were able to discuss with Melvin Ben and we are preparing to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents, the Lollapalooza -Festival 2005 in Grand Park Chicago, has been re-established for life after it was held in 2002 together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of the festival.
In 2007, the two events were equal to $9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross taxes.
These two festivals take place in the urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, against which the unscathed take place on the urban grounds," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to merge these two concepts in one way or another in order to simultaneously convey the impression of a rural festival in the European and American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes on the burden of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to award the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to host a festival that hopefully has a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very large", in about 80,000 people at the Bonnaro Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer delicious rock, but the music will be very diverse in the hope of attracting all sorts of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partner from C3, who received the Top Independent Promotion Award of the last Ballboard Touring Awards, is Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It's not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if no less than the terminator opposes.
These closures are part of the tasks of the delegates.
A political "heikles mandate", because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has been pushing Runaway Productions.
Is it hard to negotiate with the governor?
"You must be careful, because it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she'll go there.
Our role is to offer those who are best held for the best," he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the premier priority of the cinema is at the moment.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At every festival on the west coast, even though Sundance, which is made by Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, is going to present the films from Quebec, evaluate them and make sure that the producers provide interviews.
The dark age at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival had a good idea a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and is presented at the 30th Star Denver Film Festival in November.
This month Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock exchange ahead of an end-year rally? Disunity among experts due to the U.S. mortgage crisis
With almost five weeks to the end of the year at the stock exchange, investors are already rubbing their hands with regard to the coming end-year rally.
However, experts cannot create secure forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that it is purely statistical that the month of December at the stock exchange usually coincides with a positive market development
Nonetheless, it is not advisable to create short-term forecasts and only based on statistics.
Although other experts do not welcome such a strong rate increase in the last weeks of the year, they note that the stock exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and market participants, mainly due to the lack of safe equity funds in the pension funds, which is affected by the upward trend towards the profitable assets.
According to these experts, the stock exchange is more likely to show a more lateral trend influenced by market fluctuations, especially since we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible decline in the interest rate of the US notary bank, which is due mainly to the increased oil price and the risk of the rise in inflation rates.
Javier Barrio, president of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a waiting time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4 % since its peak on 8 November of 15.945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, Ibex 35 could successfully conclude this year with almost 16,000 points due to the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional one, each year.
However, the experts point out that this year things could develop slightly differently, especially due to the fact that already in the second week of December, and then immediately after the bridge day on the day of the constitution, which takes place in the end of the year.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at the Bank Inversions, the previous market assessment is at an almost technical level, which could lead to an immediate deviation from the index values, the extent of which depends on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
When selecting the values that should lead Ibex to new maximum levels, the analysts agree.
Solana by Intermoney says that this year the big values are on the line.
The expert would include the two large banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
In the meantime, Federico Olucha assures the Bank Inversions that the increase in the banking and industrial sector will be achieved.
If the Rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
In the last few months, the ACS has been on the course and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same route, as the expert said.
With regard to increased consumer behaviour during Christmas days, the market situation will be determined in the last half of the year of periodic consumption.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also produce positive sales results, even if they are represented only in a small number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, only two declines have occurred in December.
At the end of 2003, this led to the stock exchange from its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real end-year rally.
This year, in which Ibex raised 35 by 28.17 percentage points, a rate increase of 6.68% occurred in December.
Whether 2008 the fifth winning year will be followed (the Ibex has been rising by 8.36% since January) and can also present an end-year-old, will show up.
Popular will have opened its 200 credit institutions from Mondays to Fridays 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernise a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of these are located in the most economically strong regions of Spain.
For the Institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a large milestone.
But also for the remaining Spanish institutions, as Popular as the first group of banks, is waiting to extend the opening hours of its branches by 20.30h on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 20.30h.
The Bank Group BBVA, which has also repeated the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet reached a final decision.
The Bank's current negotiations with the trade unions seem to be aimed at an agreement that closes 75% of all branches on Saturdays and opens at one weekday afternoon, even if not for the customer.
If other banks join the new initiative that adapts to business opening times, the experience of the People's Bank will depend on the experience.
And that is also the intention that the popular pursues with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches, which, because of their position, can capture the customers' knowledge of independent, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also those of large buyers.
The Bank wants to open up the new 200 branch offices over the next 18 months, as it is not a new but modified opening hours.
For this purpose, the Bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already in business zones and at the same time compare them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
The extension of the opening times is linked to a new space design of the branches, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, colourful design.
The responsible bank representative, Angel Rivera, ensures that the restructuring does not require more investment, but involves an increased staffing position, as a branch now needed no more than six, but eight or nine employees.
The facilities that are even equipped with additional space for SMEs will not be sold for financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested his concept in nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, so Angel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently leads about 2500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized on immigrants and also show extended opening times, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the BBVA model is not used, as most of them will instead be offered a wide selection of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to be competitive for our customers, says Rivero.
With phoneica they have provisionally reached agreement to sell using external bank staff mobile phones.
The Spanish private player Telecinco doubles its stock exchange value for the first time and thus takes over his rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the manager of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the stock exchange. The messenger led by him had increased his value twice for his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: that's exactly what hurt me; not that we had a higher growth, but that we had less losses, he determined.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they were not too weak.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with a plus 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses to 15.66% this year.
According to Bloomberg, the company value now reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, with mediaset controlling the main share of the capital (52%), and Vocento is only 13% involved.
The Rivale Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, so that its market value is 2.193.46 million.
On the other hand, the market value of other listed communications companies increases; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, in Prisa (the editor of Cinco Días magazine) to 2,518,53 million and in Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be seen from the fact that it is two similar companies, so Vasile.
Of course, there is still a question of how much we can actually act on the stock exchange, at what price and how we can shape it on customer level.
Telecinco declared his plan a week ago to raise more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenues for the first television broadcaster this year. Guiseppe Tringali, the manager of Telecinco and Publiespana, assured the advertising company of the group.
If the project was to be implemented, the sender would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine stock months (up to 734.4 million), while net revenues from the television business increased by only 0.7% (630.4 million ).
The main factor for Telecinco's improved stock market run is the high-rate payout ratio analysts who were able to present the company so far: in 2006, Alejandro Echevarría's company launched a 100-percent dividend compensation.
Vasile, however, ensures that the rate after buying 33% of the shares of endemol, with mediaset as a parent company, could still vary, even if it is too early for an official notice.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have so far stated significantly more.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose shares we have already been able to increase by buying 33% of the endemol shares.
According to the analysts, the market currently exhibits certain losses.
Lehmann Brothers only recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco for this year by 4% and 7% for 2009.
This is the result of a reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This also reduced the forecast profit estimate of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5% and 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: places on its high effective income and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: means Telecinco (buy) due to the numerous incentives and the prospering market a more favourable position with antena 3 (holding).
3.
JPMorgan: In view of the similar threats (increased market and worse economic climate), it is recommended to reverse expectations in both cases
The Congress agrees with the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel to the parliamentary drafting, which was concluded today by the Assembly decision of the Senate on the additional/amendments to the project, the Government published the provisions of the new law with a view to enabling the entry into force of the two regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the congress and senators who had pursued the objective of establishing the best possible arrangements to ensure investor safety and regulate individual business activities in order to ensure a generally efficient market event.
In addition, the MIFID, which re-established the Securities Services Regulation, aims to modernise financial markets, improve investor protection, increase the control claim of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the various European Union control authorities.
The new Directive enables both specialised companies and natural or legal persons to offer financial advice and also contributes to the creation of new financial services undertakings (ESIS) to consult companies that join the investment and brokering companies of securities.
In addition, it extends the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions so as to add to the regulated markets the multilateral efficiency trading systems and the systems for the internationalisation of trade orders, which would eventually become competitive with the current economic operators.
The Act obliges investment firms to register the focus of their corporate profile, the confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks on the market and all the projects carried out to facilitate the control of the CNMV.
The Economic Commission for Congress followed up on further changes, with the decision that the title debt provision must now be regarded as a complex financial asset by reason of its high degree of risk to the investor, as confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis. (US mortgage crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the directive on the legal restriction of the working areas of graduates of economics was used; 30 years after 1977 the regulation, which restricted the working areas reserved for economics, was adopted.
On the other hand, the Senate established new positions in the financial sector, how the economic intermediary working abroad does not need authorisation from the CNMV and can offer its services for the commercialisation of products and for the acquisition of several investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index (IPI) has increased by five tenths in November and is now at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rates within the European Union delivers the average price developments in Spain in November.
Its publication complies with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which seek to compare local and quality data to US products by making it known.
The forecast for the indicator can be drawn up in advance by applying the same procedure as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using a number of other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) recommended that the indicator previously identified should not serve as a benchmark only, and therefore with the final result announced on 14 December.
The consumer price index (VPI) will continue to remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Head of Government and Minister of Economic and Financial Affairs Pedro Solbes, the increase in the IPI in November was a temporary development; at the same time, he assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, Solbes found in the Congress building that even if the current number is not good, the Spanish inflation gap with the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less equal in recent years.
He also explained that there were less surprises in November than in the previous month, in which the government did not expect such a high rise.
We expected a value of around 4%, the Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance announced today's forecast.
Virgin expects North Rock revenues of more than 42 billion euros in the next three years
The assets of Northern Rock are reduced by more than half, after the Bank in mid-September of last year had been crisis-driven by the British notary bank for an emergency credit, and by now they amount to only 12,000 million pounds (equivalent to EUR 16,800 million).
At that time, the Bank’s assets were recorded at 25,000 million pounds, a sum which was significantly reduced by the loss of trust of customers within two and a half months, and despite the 100 percent guarantee by the government that the money would be safe until the end of the crisis.
The Virgin company, which would continue the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, has to invest about a quarter of the British banks' revenues, which will be made up of the facilities for the next three years, in order to acquire exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their 30 billion target.
The Group of the Multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for its outstanding advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to send 50,000 million pounds (approx. 70 million euros) annually in advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named Virgin Group, where three other companies are still involved, as his favorite bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
The mayor of Totana arrested for alleged suspicion of involvement in urban corruption
The Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular) belonging to Murcia, because of the urgent suspicion of development in urban corruption that was discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipality and the head of the community police were arrested.
Last May, José Martínez Andreo presented the office of Juan Morales, currently a member of the Popular Party and then President of the Municipality of Totana, and could, according to the information provided by Cadena SER, be the original wire tractor of the plot.
The officials continue to search the business documents of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales was accused, the chief suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and consequently privileged MP Juan Morales was arrested on leaving his client's residence on the basis of important supporting documents related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information from the alleged orders of Morales are reported to a Galician construction company that intends to conclude a city building contract, in which the construction of a 200 hectares area was decided.
Eight people are currently under investigation.
Bono agrees to accept the candidate of the PSOE in Toledo and, in the case of a election victory, at the Congress.
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, and he will present the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming General Elections in Toledo and, in the case of a election of Socialists, will take over the office of the President of Congress.
This was announced by José Blanco, the organisation secretary of the PSOE, and Bono at the press conference, after a meeting with Zapatero was held in the party's headquarters today.
According to the Head of Government, the offer is justified to the former Minister, since it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, the politicians coming from Mancha, in the case of a victory for the Socialists in the upcoming elections, would appear to run for the party as president of the Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as President of Congress, who announced last November 15th that he would no longer join the next general elections, end his career in public policy and instead take part in the university field for climate protection.
The former Minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the President of the Government had repeatedly insisted on his return to political affairs.
In addition, he pointed out that the party, as in the appointment of Vice-President for Economic Affairs, did not want to prevent citizens from taking over the positions of Congress President in the event of an election, and that this referred to it as an act of transparency.
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to turn the chamber into a house of respect and not the insult or the horror in order to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Regrettably, from time to time, one wins the impression that the only place where one cannot speak peacefully and let it be in Madrid is the Congress; thus, the president of the Senate was interrupted up to 26 times.
At the same time, he commended the current president Manuel Martín and his good work and stated that he did not want to raise the view that the office had already taken over, otherwise his political opponents would be considered arrogant.
Climate propaganda
Since climate debate is a subject of unmerciful criticism, both climate change skeptics and those who are leading a social and political debate in this regard, the movement as a whole must bring about strong cohesion.
Especially when it comes to a leader of the movement who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
This proposal, however, makes it clear in the declaration of action, or non-trade of its government, which has contributed strongly to the fact that Spain is at the top of the EU, which has at least fulfilled the Kyoto Protocol's requirements.
Who are responsible for the failure to meet the requirements to which sectors this is due and why his government, which proposed the treaty with the planet, has not stopped this development.
In addition, he has now been forced to present to the Spanish citizens the measures he intends to take against climate change without changing.
What companies will be affected by the behaviour to be changed by citizens, what individual and collective savings measures have to be taken, and what economic consequences this entails.
More precisely, who needs to sacrifice and will be paid to save the planet.
However, it has and will not give such explanations in the future.
Just because it's about the sacrifice and the payment.
Because the measures that can be implemented against climate change are unwelcome.
They are expensive, uncomfortable and dangerous for the companies' and citizens' accounts.
Even the petrol-cent proposed by the PSOE appeared selectively so dangerous that he saw himself forced to withdraw the proposal again.
Accordingly, it is now applicable to save the planets with nothing, so with pure propaganda and empty phrases without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, Commission, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his treaties with the planet, the other politicians who are so suitable for election campaigns must neither speak nor accuse, nor demand, but instead follow the demanding edition to taste the meetings and to inspire others with his humility and goodness.
But this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its pure virtual nature and therefore does not provide that the bike will be the only means of movement in the future or we can only refresh ourselves with a field.
The mayor and police chief of Totana due to the alleged development of urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo, belonging to Murcia. Also, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office, and a hotel entrepreneur were taken into custody because of the deliberate suspicion of urban violations, today it was said of investigation.
The city council was held at its headquarters, from which it was brought to the community and is in its premises until now surrounded by numerous agents who were also in the city administration and in the municipal construction of Suelo Industrial y Vivida.
The three arrests relate to the last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, which showed that more than 2 million hectares of unexploited construction for urban projects should be redesigned under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria.
In addition, two other persons were not directly arrested, but were subject to an investigation procedure, which was brought before and carried out by the First Court of Totonas.
The first six prisoners were brought before the judge today.
According to investigations, Juan Morales is also identified against Totana's former mayor and current independent PP agent.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, the owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his present friend, is suspected in Murcia.
The president and owner of the Nuaria Group , the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A. from Vigo, was arrested in the village of Nigran (Ponteverra), as well as the manager of Suelo de Immonaur Pablo José M.G., whose company works as a group of Nuaria and is expected to receive the money of the perfume.
The investigations are carried out by the municipal authority against urban criminals, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven further investigations, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At this time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regional known poultry farm that should have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria building group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in Murcia, which should include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
In Totana, the company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometres of area that could be converted. The aim was to implement a construction project that would raise the community's population to 25,000 people.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomoyar, which promote the sale of property; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking areas of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católica; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector and Preconiza, specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of construction products.
Things That Can Happen
1.
If you agree to this, we will avoid the expression Book of the month and instead try to find a price designation of other names with corresponding competences.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course you are cordially invited to make your suggestions.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsinki Sanomat, a comment published (Finland is also at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on November 18th; randomly on that day, the issue of which included criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of the philosophy section has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy around the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murder is an Abitorent who quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
In an interview with the Helsinki Sanomat daily newspaper, the president of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, asked teachers to take a more critical position towards Plato and proposed to delete Plato's teaching from the sub-level curriculum for the Philosophy of Gymnasia.

A colleague informs about the admission of illegal internet downloads to criminal law:
A. The download of a song would be a violation of the law, which would be subject to six months' imprisonment.
However, once again, if you rob a music store below a value of 400 euros, this is only considered as a simple breach (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, then the theft becomes a criminal offence, yet the penalty falls less than when a download is made (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you listen to a car and it returns forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than at a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less important to participate in a battle than in a music data exchange.
A three to 12-month prison sentence (Article 154 of the Penal Code) is involved in a rebel dispute, while the exchange of data results in a six-month prison sentence of up to two years.
(Article 270 Penal Code).
E. According to article 184.2 of the Penal Code, sexual harassment at work is considered to be less bad than downloading a DVD from the Internet.
F. Trade in copyright-protected films, whose authorisation has not been granted by the authors, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague should have rights, then someone's got his demands pretty high.

My house doctor gives me one of his long, rare research articles entitled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when the others get more of it.
So the feelings arising from the monthly payment of remuneration depend on the level of colleagues.
The study was developed using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the latest edition of the Science Journal.
According to the statement Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Bonner Brain Research Centre Life&Brain, the activation was the strongest then when the participant gave the right answers and stepped up his partner.
The researchers were able to recognize that the brain activities were always very moderate when both participants were correct in their response and therefore received the same content; but if one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not sure whether it actually requires so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The state attorney from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been following the Balkan war criminals for eight years. Her office is in the State Prosecutor's Office of the Court of Justice of the former Yugoslavia, located in La Haya.
Their mandate will run out at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a tearing and smiling eye, as the chief leaders of the Srebrenica massacre - at the age of eight thousand Bosnian Muslims - the former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic are still on a free footing.
Its names are listed by the director Marcel Schüpbach, from Switzerland, as a template for the title of his documentary film La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet published in Spain); a film that, with the pace of a police triller, follows the Swiss state attorney from Belgrade to New York in its project to detect the missing criminals and put the respective governments under pressure to narrow their networks.
What insurance is best suited for me?
The KFZ insurance, which covers a possible accident caused by the driver, includes a high cost burden, which, in turn, depends on various factors, such as age, gender, time of creation of driver's license, family status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even harder to find the appropriate KFZ insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, it has to be clear what we have to do here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurer.
This Agreement shall be concluded in writing by means of an insurance contract which stipulates that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and is obliged to submit the amount of the compensation in respect of an accident.
The insurance premium is the price of insurance consisting of several factors, including age, gender, time of creation of driver's license, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance undertakings shall determine their prices according to the statistics so that, in the event of a higher accident, higher contribution payments are also due.
For this reason, both 25-year-olds and women have to make less contributions, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate because of their precautions.
The same applies to married persons, since, according to the statistical values and therefore, even after the companies are convinced, they tend to be less accidents than individuals.
The benefits of measuring the vehicle affect the frequency of driving and thus also the probability of an accident.
The more often the use, the more likely the damage.
In setting up the premium, the insurance must take into account a whole series of points.
For this reason, the driver also has to study the situation thoroughly to choose exactly the car insurance that meets his personal needs first.
We are now listing the most important points that should be taken into consideration in the selection of insurance in order not only to be able to make a performance, but also to make a priority choice.
The 25-year-olds meet many obstacles, such as low driving practice and the young driver's license, when choosing affordable insurance.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance protection to complete a full insurance insurance, there are still more cost-effective alternatives.
Careful drivers can choose a full-cash with self-interest, so that the benefits of a full-cash insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract includes that the customer must pay part of the amount caused by the damage itself.
The amount is fixed before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, the Spanish chief representative of First Europe, a broker for online insurance.
Another option is the extended insurance that ensures customers against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused by their own car.
Furthermore, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a council.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is in your hand to reduce insurance costs; your benefit increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit card is a reduction in the base office in the insurance company concerned.
On the contrary, a penalty payment includes an increase in tariffs.
The amount of credit and penalty payments depends on the company and its earnings.
If the company has a productive year back, it can allow itself to increase the bonus payments, Noguera explains.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. The reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving practice the accident rate decreases.
It is therefore most appropriate to decide for a full insurance with self-interest.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish leader of the European company, and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner has been dropped.
However, it is more advisable for a married client who does not have children to complete full insurance; of course, only if it allows the financial situation of the person concerned.
On the part of the insurer, couples with children as the customers with the lowest accident rate, and consequently, their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, a full insurance with self-interest (in an amount of EUR 300) would be the best option. In case you have received a high credit card, an extended insurance is recommended, which is used only for the third year of the vehicle.
In total, they are more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera states.
For pensioners, it is proposed to complete a full insurance with self-interest (at an amount of EUR 150) or an extended insurance, which is used only with a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it costs high costs that require a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes in Milan at the point for the eighth final
The FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight the point they lack on the next Tuesday in San Siro to reach their respective goals before the final round of the Champions League. The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group, while it decides on their participation in the shots.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed its participation in the fifth round with a decision in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine more points is needed to ensure that FC Shakhtar with six points does not include Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as the FC Milan will have to take place at the FIFA World Cup Championship in Japan, where he will fight for the first time at the 13th semifinal to join the 16th final.
Thus this group will be completed in front of all others and the uncertainty in Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the expected result, even if both teams are trying to win. The Italians will not speculate at home, the Celtic Glasgow knows that they would be in the case of a winning group leader and thus have a better starting position in the eighth final.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even have enough downgrade in a fall of the FC Shakhtar. However, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because at nine points the Ukrainians are equal; they had lost in Glasgow last week (2-1) but could win in the second game (2-0).
Thus, the Milanians will try to avoid the shots in the evening. They hope to reach the eight finals of the redesigned Champions League for the second time, after they were defeated in the very same round in the pre-season season by a door of Kaka in the play time (1-0) and by a zero to zero undecided on the example.
While the FC Shakhtar waits for the victory of the Rossoneri, the team will have to focus on its own game, as both the achievement of the eight final and its membership at UEFA depend on its victory and a defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
In spite of its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European championship, Benfica Lisbon could win third place by winning and thus play with UEFA.
20,000 people visit the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls gave in the Canadian Vancouver in front of 20,000 spectators for their first tour after the band was dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before the start of her concert at GM Place de Vancouver Stadium that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
About 20,000 people were able to live in the sold stadium, showing a video about the history of the band, which had taken care of Furore at the end of the 1990s.
The reunification and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album containing their biggest hits and two more new songs, headslines and voodoo, which appears in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore gold bracelets on the stage that had previously been donated to them by the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the fans in the audience, who brought the GM Palace to shine, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had banned it in the past days.
During the preparations for the show, Victoria Beckham said that the British star did not get our wardrobe once, and that's why I'm so excited about what he's going to do.
Sporty Spice , whose departure from the group in 1998 was due to internal differences of opinion two years later, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world's public had changed, that the feelings of the Spice Girls had changed.
And that is why I thought why not; so I am glad to have made this decision, Chisholm expressed himself to the separation of the band she had set up nine years ago.
The singer also said that the disputes had been eliminated and that all of them loved each other very much.
However, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
The group first arrived in a special machine of Virgin Airlines in Vancouver after a report from the TV broadcaster CTV.
When they arrived at the airport, the band was received by an army of girls.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will be the next in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will enter the stage on 23 December.
New fears about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute rages between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk of Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe.
The majority of Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are led by Ukraine and each dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will account for higher transit charges from Russia.
An earlier conflict between the two countries has reduced deliveries to the EU countries in the last year.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow takes place at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom try to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be calculated more, as the Group has agreed to pay up to 50% extra for natural gas from the neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine must pay 40% more for the imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gastransit countries in talks," said the Minister of Economic Affairs of Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh of the News Agency Reuters.
"The changing prices of natural gas should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit charges [to Western Europe] over Ukraine."
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom briefed deliveries to Ukraine.
This led to a case of exports to Western Europe, leading to a dramatic increase in prices.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of the European Union's supplies.
Russia has the world's largest gas emissions, but many of them remain underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom complements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "to check foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service has to improve the checks on pre-trial registers for workers from outside Europe, said one member of the control body outside.
The recommendation of Chief Financial Controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in conjunction with the attack on the airport of Glasgow in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish State Health Service had no accurate ideas about the number of foreign employees.
However, his report pointed out that other important checks were carried out in the case of a sample of five health authorities.
The Chief Financial Controller investigated staff recruited outside the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on the airport of Glasgow.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after driving a car through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transmission in October in Old Bailey and was charged in connection with the moderate car bomb attack in Britain.
It is expected that the public health service will carry out checks in advance of the appointment of foreign employees to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorisations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities are using Dissoluse Scotland to check pre-trial records, the Agency does not have the responsibility to obtain this information outside the UK.
The report of the Chief Inspector now says, in addition to other recommendations, that the Board should act on guidelines for criminal prosecution, assisting employers in checks in different countries.
"Although we have found evidence of these controls in some of the staff's submissions, they have not been routinely carried out," the report noted.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their research guidelines to a high degree before they were employed, but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved in order to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign health workers is available."
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations in advance of the deployment of potential NHS employees would identify people who could face future terrorist attacks.
"In the report it means that current pre-position tests of NHS Scotland work well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will be given," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the majority of them doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, even because the authorities had problems identifying those employees who were allowed to work for an indefinite period.
The investigation further found that established control procedures of NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were largely observed.
These include passports, work permits, and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for checks prior to the start of employment for foreign personnel in the NHS.
The Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was a matter for me to carry out this work in view of the terrorist attack on the airport of Glasgow."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that best practices in updated guidelines regarding control investigations would be reflected in advance of the appointment of all employees - including those from abroad - whose publication is planned next month.
Joy Division dominates film award
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has hosted five prizes at the British Independent Film Festivals, including for the best film.
Prices were also awarded to Chief Agent Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before he was cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbín, and subsidiary Toby Kebbell.
Lady Judi Dench was awarded the best major performer for the Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond-Darseller Daniel Craig won the Variety Prize for turning the British film into the world's public.
The prizes were handed over at a ceremony in London's Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at 23 years of age.
The black-and-white film - on whose soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order are to be found - was turned for only 3 million British pounds.
However, he introduced the Dutch photographer Corbín, the first known for the cultic cover of the U2 Album Joshua Tree, two prizes - as the best director and the best director.
Rockmusic was the focus of another winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about the Clash singer Joe Strummer received the prize for the best documentary film.
The prize for the best performers went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a Russian Mafia boss in David Cronenbergs in London's Thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winston, who is in charge of playing hard guys, took the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films are Scum, Nile by Mouth and Sexy Biest, is currently filming the Indiana Jones Continuation The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winston said he was proud to receive the prize named after the Camelot and Harry Potter Star Harris, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of man, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film prices, known as Bifas, are selected by a group, belong to filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Sea Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia because of a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia discovered yesterday that it had arrested 208 soldiers because of their belonging to cells who had planned an upcoming attack on an oil plant as well as on spiritual and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle rockets.
Sympathetics from Al-Qaida have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion in Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign national, is attacking an oil plant in the eastern province, after the TV report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000 men strong rapid intervention force to protect the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to a domestic declaration, says that 18 of the detainees belonged to a cell led by a "rake expert" who illegally immigrated to the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
Another 22 of the detainees had reported on the death of spiritual and security forces.
The government has warned more to stop Saudis who are trying to join Al Qaida militias in Iraq, who want to fight allied forces and the US-supported Shiite Muslim government, which is viewed by the hardliners under the Sunni Saudis as ketzeric.
Al Qaida militias consider many spiritual people in Saudi Arabia to be in cooperation with the authorities in supporting the policy of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the leader Al Qaida born in Saudi Arabia to target the provincial Saudi government - have distinguished it from foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
"This was a very great effort by the security forces over the last five months," a spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior told the State TV.
The arrests also included a "medicine cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed at recruiting for the "Takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims who are being burned as unbelievers and dejectives.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of having provided financial support to the militia.
The climate on Venus could reveal a view of the future of the earth
The Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft operating on a orbit show that the planet is even more similar to a distant twinge of the earth than it was previously aware of.
The Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to the Earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planets, but the Venus of the Sun is somewhat closer.
Millions of years ago, on Venus, conditions that were very similar to those on earth and could even be inhabited by scientists today would have prevailed.
But due to the most unstoppable carbon dioxide effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rotation rate, the Venus introduced a completely different development course.
Today the planet is stolen from water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is destroyed by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the Venus Express space probe of the European Space Agency, which examined the plants for a year, offer a refreshing view of how the earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the leading Venus Express Mission, said: "It will be clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of Earth, while the planets are otherwise similar."
"Our new data enables us to construct a scenario in which the Venus began billions of years ago as the Earth may have with a residential environment."
"Enriched Uran" seized by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was arrested yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said that three people were arrested and that the material was being tested.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
Everything is still open
In the midst of Romey, he said he did not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
However, the Republican candidate for the presidency finally declared himself prepared to take a debate on YouTube, in which normal voters will take up and submit questions on video to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday, 28 November, were as ridiculous as the snowman, the Democrats asked about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, reflected exactly this time the state of the Republican Party, which will be in the elections next year.
It is not known, just like the CNN producers who supported the debate with the candidates who chose YouTube clips to show.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, which was devoted to one single issue, immigration was at the centre of the debate.
The issue is one of the most powerful issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to serve a selection disc when they heard things that felt to them: The TV channel noticed points of agreement when the candidates spoke strictly across borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national leader, and Romney, who moved ahead in the crucial surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to unwind the call, since he was a mayor of New York for illegal immigration.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of posting illegal immigrants for work at his house.
The two were particularly asked whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (the illegals would provide a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
More important candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, were able to explore this topic.
None of the two men have serious opportunities to nominate, but both of them remain in the race, perhaps because they have spent more time and more than others on immigration.
At least in the area of immigration, candidates share the same views in large and all: stricter borders, intolerance against illegal migrants.
This theme, together with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps the Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic as other subjects.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he has supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drinking should be considered torture.
One of the Frastalists asked whether the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to point out that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now opposite all expectations in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was forced to ask whether Jesus would answer her, he laughed at her and said that Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains extremely open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa is accompanied by Ron Paul's latest donations and his accruals in the debate on Wednesday.
These two are shot out of nowhere, because the two birds of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the most famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party from the beginning and convincingly united with a victorious message about the size of America and a twin to both birds of the party.
This time the party is split and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly sloppy.
No title appears to be sold, no politician paid Paris hotel bills, no exceptional toes were heard.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has spent more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million pounds) on behalf of other people over four years, and that the party has failed to report this is something that would have been good without the fighting Gordon Brown.
When two months ago the Prime Minister had withdrawn the request after an election, in this way the intelligence of the British had been adversely affected by claiming that opinion polls had not affected this decision, there was hope that he would provide a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, who was increasingly keen to represent the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the once-feared Brown from Stalin has developed to Mr. Bean.
The unscrupulous rescue of Northern Rock, a bank hit, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgmental powers under arrest.
Badly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have set up business associations against the government.
The tax authorities' loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative fraud.
A Trio of Generals in Rest began a rebellion in the Oberhaus in protest against reductions in military spending: being a minister of the military, they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the many gifts of David Abraham; Peter Watt, Secretary General of Labour (and her former CEO) has already retired.
It doesn't mean that Brown's going to break down in the direction of the retreat.
However, governments can reach a turning point after which they cannot feel it.
They don't even like people who are politicians, but they usually keep their skeps back when a new force takes over the office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and he does not need to be there for a long time, this upheaval is over: the public service is beginning to become void; the cabinet ministers are starting to complain; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is going to be defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because he cannot claim to be a new bees instead of other political leaders.
If he wanted to lie to Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and tax jurisdiction, for example, are linked to decisions that Brown made as an officer of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if he wasn't directly involved in Blair's misdemeanour - like in the long "Gold for noble titles" investigation of political party funding - the voters may assume that he was.
Nevertheless, Brown's situation isn't as bad as it looks.
The mistakes are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely overwhelmed.
And the opposite, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Browns of course have always promised Stalinist tendencies: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new belief in political donations is a good example.
The garboesque Abraham, who compares his gifts to his non-profits, says he does not wish public recognition for his well-being.
That may be the case, but the decision about it did not come to him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
What he said would have known about Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, of course some questions will have to be asked; just like Jon Mendleson, Labour's chief financial advisor, who was told about the independent donations in October.
But so far Brown is not involved: There is nothing that indicates that he knew about these confusions, although most of the payments after his office was made in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has accomplished half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered down this determination by taking after a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - in order to complete the measure by a bishop in peace and a judge.
In this case, the "learning to be drawn from" are not very complicated.
When the law was broken, it was a matter for the police.
Apart from this, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, like finding a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been unoccupied for six months, and moving forward with a comprehensive reform of political party funding.
This would require the hardliners of the laborer to cooperate with the conservatives and perhaps to give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party-owned person like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some party facts.
The conservatives now have a clear leadership in opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can win a victory is through irrevocable justice and solid competence.
Cardboards
Does the credit crisis in America set the credit card market up?
When blood is in the water, it is only natural that the backflows stir up.
Now that America's real estate market is failing, the predators have the country's credit card market in their visa.
Analysts from Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the risk of underfunded credit spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
The signs of the tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both the bookcases and the rates of payroll that measure the proportion of loans that are not deductible or are too late for more than 30 days.
In the last month, HSBC announced that it had taken a $1.4 billion levy from its US consumer financing, partly due to the weakness of credit card holders.
It's still too early to panic.
Losses and hives are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third quarter rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
In part, the deterioration in the rates can be explained by technical factors.
An amendment to US Private Solvency Law in 2005 led to an abrupt case of competition applications that would in turn constitute a large part of the card losses; the number of applications (and thus fees) would increase again, whether or not the general conditions for creditors would deteriorate.
The industry also reports on strong rates of payment that show how much of their debts consumers pay each month
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other areas of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney from the TowerGroup, a research firm, estimates that the spending amounts for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
Direct channels of infection between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market are certain: it is more likely that consumers will accept credit card debts, now that their own credit will be liquidated.
However, the card issuers look at the cash flow instead of capital values, so falling home prices do not necessarily result in a change in the creditworthiness of the creditor.
You can even be of benefit to the card exhibitors.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates are reduced if the assets are less value than the value of the loan; as a result, the credit card debts will become more important under the repayment priorities.
Map exhibitors can also respond much faster and more flexible than creditors to the stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid reassessment of assets.
"We won't wake up one day and reassess the loans completely," says Gary Perlin, Capital Ones Chief Financial Rapporteur.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable depreciation are much more real.
If lower domestic prices and a credit reduction in America are pushed into recession, the industry will no doubt face a more bitter future.
Keep them looking at these sharks.
British bankers confess guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers, who were to be brought before the court for their role in the deceptive system with the former Chief Finance Officer of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their search on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally had an innocent plea for fraud in seven cases using telecommunications means for alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was launched in January.
But during a hearing before the U.S. District Court, Ewing Werlein Junior complained about a case of fraud involving telecommunications.
The three former leaders of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were known in Britain during the two-year delivery process.
In the United States, its case is an endless end to an investigation initiated after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The allegations they initially filed in 2002 were pointed out by Fastow that it was the objective of an investigation by the government in relation to the Enron decline.
The charges against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claimed to have come to Houston in 2000 to raise a deceptive plot with fastow and his former top advisor Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron, which was controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron machines that contributed to the company's success in the competition dispute.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank valued its participation in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew that it had a significant value.
A company under copper control acquired the Bank's share of the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid copper $250,000 for participation in this company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow wrongly argued against Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the 20 million dollars went to the British bankers, fasts and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while fastow, copper and some 12.3 million dollars were dropped, according to the prosecution.
In January 2004, fastow was known to have been guilty of conspiracy in two counts for his role in Enron's proceedings.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a 6-year prison sentence in the federal prison of Louisiana.
Copper is serving a three-year sentence and a month in an institution in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was free on the basis of a $1 million bail that made it necessary for them to live in the United States in expectation of the trial.
Enron, once the nation's seventh largest company, was involved in the competition in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer cover the billions of debts or weak businesses could prove profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollar pension plans.
The Enron Founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Schilling were sentenced last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Schilling is a punishment of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were null and void after he died of heart disease last year.
Not quite down in Moscow
The price of an aircraft of the G550 Golfstream brand, equipped with a roll-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But this is Kleinfeld for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers room for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you asks for so many seats because it's for a private family or a president."
Firer was at the Gulf Stream on the last Friday at the Millionaire Exhibition, a four-day organ of consumption, which was held in a closed exhibition centre on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built exhibition positions, hoping to interest newly arrived Russians in everything, from Mahagoni-feeled yachts to diamond-crossed car grills, which would be suitable for 50 cents.
Fire carefully took a brilliant orange Porsche at the next exhibition stand in the vissier.
"That's a nice car, but it's Smallfeld compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Hot with an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be overrun with money like Dallas in its glossy times.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s, when some Americans came to giant wealth and went to the sheep market where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi-Arab refugees of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians came out as the world’s most visible free of charge.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of gold.
In Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, has been called on to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods on markets like Russia.
(The conference is organised by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billion dollars, totaling 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, worth $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written here by economic experts from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8% of the Russians lived under the minimum of existence.)
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the fair for the first time together with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all exemplary and the men are all worth a fortune."
While they wear evening clothing through the halls, two real estate brokers, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, themselves and their clients call themselves millionaires.
"I've looked at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Mrs. Yumatova, who delivered the design clothes she wore, like a rotter carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed primarily to focus on the new rich, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand several hours in the barn to visit an additional warehouse, which conveniently placed Cadillac Escalades, platinum bags, movenpick ice cream, tailor-made billiards, apartments in Dubai and gond Teddyburys next to each other.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotic at a exhibition by the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a large wall image of a rembrandt made of hand painted blue mosaics.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper-Klimper."
In fact, the traders say here that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of overnight brands with limited number of items that would not be marketed at a commercial show.
Nevertheless, thousands of people, whether millionaires, sent by millions or simply tourists, were forced through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show on the last Thursday, Roman Ersov, the general manager of King Koil Bedten, said here he had sold two $70,000 matratzensets, made of silk, Kashmir and cotton, with fine gold linings.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, said that a company has equipped the high-end cars with high-end alarm systems that its company has sold the green orange Porsche for 170,000 dollars to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customers' wishes, said he would have sold three auto-coolers grills for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, the same for each of the related chain arms, for $55,000.
He showed a reporter a car tire that was developed for a Russian casino owner, with storage that he had worn with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulette.
Costs: $22,000 for a quarter.
"The Russian millionaire, the Strauss Wheels or a picture of his wife's face from the Cuban zirconium will not necessarily ride on these wheels," said Mr Karapetian.
"He will keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage."
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they're probably already millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires could at least do as much as if they were rich at a position operated by the Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red telephone cells according to the British model, which were completely closed with mountains of false millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees would have printed 500,000 false bank notes for the millionaire fair.
Passengers stopped to turn the hedgehogs around, to take pictures of mobile phones, while they refused in the middle of the replacement wealth, to be cut by friends, or simply to insert a few million.
"See, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr Karryev.
Suspected operation at death in New Jersey
It was the day before the harvest party as Ronald Livingston saw the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier Restaurant here and watched as a car on the white Cape Cod held two doors below the West Scott Avenue.
Soon after that, there was a police car.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the boxing car of the medical bodyguard arrive," said Livingstone, a supervisor of the restaurant, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone was dead."
The authorities found that the dead Mrs. Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now, the investigators are trying to determine whether they died because of a procedure carried out by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon who was not identified by the police and who worked at the house at West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet found what has caused Mrs Arroyos' death, and they are hoping that toxocological investigations, whose results could not be available for weeks, will help to clarify a mysterious death sent by a sorrow through the leadership tip of the Newark Police.
Since September 2006, Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the Police Director, Garry F. McCarthy, and her voice has been widely known in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and hard-working," said Mr. McCarthy about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"Look at my Pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesperson for the State Prosecutor of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorized surgical treatment.
"That's one of the possibilities," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's a ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house about 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on site.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have reported little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to tell me if Mrs Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators try to determine whether a part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a flattered rose snout is in the next courtyard and a Dalmatian is lying behind the house.
A blue belt with "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark, after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable value and helped him find himself in the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to watch this or that one'," he said.
"She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I went.
It was painful."
Hopes that the central bank will reduce interest will lead to an increase in the world stock markets
Yesterday the shares ran to both sides of the Atlantic, after market openings that the Central Bank would try to calm down the credit markets by further interest reductions, aggravating comments were strengthened by the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
The stock markets increased in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kahn, number 2 by Ben Bernanke, the president of the Central Bank, said that politics had to react "flexible and pragmatic" to the constant pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm down depressing markets, given the signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said that the latest turbulence had " partly reversed some of the improvements in market functions from the late part of September and October".
If there were any increased turbulence, it would increase the possibility of further strengthening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were received by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to step in and stabilise the credit conditions with new capital prices in US markets and possible further interest rates.
The performances also helped calm the Wall Street, given other bad news from the US economy, as the sales of US properties reached a new record in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that they will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 per cent of their global workers, in a cost reduction measure, in order to offset serious losses from their lost assets in the US mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these places will disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent to close at 13,289.40, while the broad-angled S&P 500 index rose by 2.65 percent.
In London the FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent to close at 6,306.2, which added more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's index Dax increased by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
In the past, the resumption of credit pressure on the markets was underlined after a strong demand for a three-month guarantee auction by the European Central Bank, which was granted to the European commercial banks, amounted to 4,7 per cent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow up and to feed further capital resources into the money markets in London increased when the three-month "Libor" councils to lend between UK banks with 6.59 percent at their peak were seen to rise since late September following a continuous increase since 21 November.
England faced a decision about the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each of which is almost as difficult as the other.
Who's going to hit England's number 6 this weekend in Candy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important, because David Graveney, the President-in-Office, at least on call under this special title, is here to help the Chief coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morris, the English business manager, is filled with applications for national voters, even if not for which in part time.
Anyone who does not always get the sixth battle position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is certainly it.
It is never easy to find exactly what a person can achieve the tops of his career, while someone else never rises above the lowest rank, sometimes from lack of luck instead of ability.
It is not only in the cricket, where the selection is difficult, where judgements are needed, which are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time to raise Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah when he does it?
The same may also be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" banners should be carried, both intelligent young executives with good conclusions, who know the business well.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, figures have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a fighter must get regular chances on the order if he wants to make a day-to-day cricket player impression.
Catching the eyes of the voters is more complicated.
There were many who in the last season were better than, for example, James Anderson, who would appear to play in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison himself declared to be healthy and how the wind boiled into the net.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with 33 rounds to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hoped for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara is playing at the Asgiriya stage, there can be only one question of opinion.
The choice could determine the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, at that time still struggling to strengthen himself, who created the breakthrough to a significant test cricket player and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and abdominal feeling for Shah's greater experience of bopara's youthful enthusiasm after further discussion during the current network meeting at Asgiria Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, he speaks of his working and valuable 88 test-debüt-innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundred and only six of Bopara, who is 22 years younger, and an excellent balance against affected balls.
But Shah only made ten runs in his two innings in May against West India in the test in Lord, his Heimatherena as a Middlesex player, and this, in addition to his immediate rejection of the voters as Vaughan to take his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing out of his battle, which was still obvious in Bombay.
In contrast, the essex beauty of all kinds is unfortunately a lifelong pleasure.
He was not impressed by anything on a cricket site and his attitude was taken away from it when he had recently crossed a four-wheeled vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered smaller injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to pick up his Vodafone (of course also sponsor) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had observed this from a distance, and say with enthusiasm, "Have you seen this?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he conjures his middle tempo with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing to choose the right time another.
Maybe that's the real art of the selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not be well there when, as the tea set suggests from Ceylon, he is the one who's going to play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived yesterday in Baghdad, with a stream of displaced people, whose funds or visas have run out, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels who had driven them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, regarding the Shiite militias of the militant priest Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to return to the present time.
Qasim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Scottish teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime of Iraq was not allowed to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah urged him to tell him that a local militia supported by the United States had contributed to the distribution of Al-Qaida from its base in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe, who was driven out of his house in Sleich in northern Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after calling on his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaidas.
He was back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started one of the anti-Al-Qaida militias in Sleikh and that they needed my support and the boys.
That's why I'm back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many reported that they had been attracted by the increasing peace in the capital since the rise in the US troops and by the growth of local "groups affected" who were armed and in cooperation with the American military to defend their city districts.
But more were said to have been forced home by visa problems and money-laundering in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Scottish Prime Minister who had requested the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are probably escaped from the sectarian death squads in the country.
"We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government forced the Iraqis to give no more visas to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who knocked down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunni were driven from Shitian residential areas and vice versa, leading to the creation of many places where tensions have left behind.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will cause sectarian tensions again and there will be conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is leading and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education do the Saarland have the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I've declared yesterday at 50th time a non-Saar country that we are not French" - this slogan pictures the smallest federal state self-ironically on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which is in place in the education monitor of the Institute of German Economy Cologne (IW).
This is how the universities are working closely with the neighbouring countries from tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their study with a double or even triple.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 per cent.
But also the country kids bring the Saarland in an average number to the universities - many of them without a graduation at the gym.
"In Saarland you use the vocational education system," says Axel Plünnecke, education experts at IW.
More than every five young person acquires his study license at a vocational school, thus Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination opportunities for vocational and academic training are also considerably expanded.
As measured by the population, the equipment with dual courses is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has decreased by one third in recent years.
This is why the Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering matters.
"At the schools in general, we have encountered several reforms after the first Pisa study," says one spokesperson of the Ministry of Education.
The government thus introduced national comparative tests.
In order to start learning children earlier, the last year of Kita is free of charge - a model that is currently copying other federal countries.
Whether the student’s performance will be improved in a sustainable way will only show future comparative studies.
In Pisa 2003, the proportion of students at risk decreased from 29% to 20%.
Overall, however, Saarland did not increase as strongly as other federal countries.
The Bavarians are better off.
And, to the surprise of the Saarland, foreign language skills will not be measured at Pisa - in this area you might be able to point otherwise.
Because the language of the neighbours is compulsory in Gymnasia - even if the Saarland are not French.
Chávez sets the clocks
In Venezuela, the clocks are almost different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December President Hugo Chávez will be allowed to return the time fair in the South American country for half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke figure.
As the Venezuelan Official Journal reported, the clocks will be set at the world time by a new law of less than four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
The US enemy Chávez justified his decision, among other things, that the United States of the world should have made the division in time zones to full hours.
In addition, on Wednesday (place time) because of a Geiselaffere announced the interruption of relations with neighboring Colombia.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe President of Colombia remains, he will not have relations with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this on my own because of my dignity," said Chávez, who advocates a constitutional reform, about which the citizens of the island must vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would clearly expand his power in the country.
The reason for the dispute was the decision by Uribes, Chávez to withdraw the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, where it was about the release of hostages.
Uribe had "put in the face" Venezuela, with his decision, had criticised Chávez on Sunday.
Even in Spain, Chávez is all over the mouth.
A new mobile Klingelton ensures for Furore in the country: "Porque no te callas" (Why don't you hold your mouth) is the phrase that has already downloaded over half a million people from the Internet.
He was addressed by King Juan Carlos of Spain, who was generated on the recent Ibero-American summit by the constant call of the left populist and ran it over the mouth.
German threatens 2007 wage minus
Despite the strong economic situation, German workers are threatened with a real pay loss, according to this year's forecast.
Experts called a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prediction.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, the employees in 2007 could actually calculate less on the balance sheet than in the previous year.
"The debt is due to modest wage development, higher VAT and higher prices for food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Image" section.
New burdens could also come from unemployment insurance for workers.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung", the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 per cent for the current situation is correct and reasonable.
However, the Federal Labour Agency must not be in a position to ask for loans or grants when the federal government has to do so, the SPD politician has been quoted.
On Tuesday it was announced that the price explosion in food and mineral oil has been running at the highest level for 13 years.
Total prices increased by 3.0 per cent in the year compared to the year.
Venus is the cavelic twinning of the earth
The Venus is more similar than ever thought in spite of its vivid atmosphere: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and windmills in Poland, as they appear on earth in the winter.
For almost three decades scientists have suspected that it is on the Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has given evidence - it felt electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The lightnings on the Venus shoot at about 56 kilometers from clouds to clouds, reports Christopher Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "supply theory", lightnings have created life on earth: Winds are supposed to stimulate reactions in the ocean leading to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in the very early history," says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, the surface of Venus is hardly something alive: The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on earth, it reigns with temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the devil's deception of the earth, but it is a twin," said Russell.
Why the Venus, which is so much like the Earth in mass and size, has so much to do with other developments, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The beginning of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as since the beginning of the 1990s no more was a probe specifically used to explore this planet.
The latest research results, now presented in several "natural" articles, do not only emphasize the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system, according to researchers.
"They also show that the communions of our neighboring planet with the earth are larger than initially assumed," the Esa shares.
In addition to the already known wind wind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloudstorm at the South Pole, which is much faster turning.
The phenomenon reminds of air currents on the Earth’s winter atmosphere, writes a team of researchers about Giuseppe Picconi from the Italian Institute of Astrophysica Spatiale e Physics Cosmica.
The second thinner planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost as large with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or the evening star, crosses the sun in just 225 days.
But it turns much slower around itself: a Friday lasts 243 days.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly reminds the Earth, scientists assume that both planets were created under similar conditions.
On both of them, water gathered, which remained on earth in the oceans, but on Venus went to the space of the world.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on earth in carbonace stones, it makes up the vast majority of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkels Meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for an end to the party's dispute about the reception of the Dalai Lama in the office.
Indirectly, he criticised the SPD for their attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler takes care of Germany's views and has called on the great coalition to end the struggle to receive the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present the outside world in this matter to a split nation," Köhler told the trade sheet.
At the same time, Kohler signed an understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"The human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knew that Germany had to be a sensitive balance in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but Merkel took it in front of the proposal to protect them, and they were running a new Chinese policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not withdrawn from the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too," said Kohler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly exposed the boldness of the Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by a series of Unions.
Steinmeier had, among other things, complained about the Union's 's foreign policy'.
After receiving the Dalai Lamas in the office, there were too severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
In this way, the Chinese leadership not only expelled German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the Foreign Ministers of the two countries, according to SPIEEGEL.
China's Head of Government Wen Jiabao has now called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to accept the Dalai Lamas as an error.
China rejects when European politicians officially receive the religious leader of Tibet, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lamas showed that he was trying to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other current provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns against screws like in France
Street fights with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against crabs like in France.
Everything had to be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany did not get rid of violence on the street, the Federal Minister asked.
Barricades burned, Randaliers shot at the police with shrews: after the heavy youth riots in France, Federal Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) in Germany fears a similar development.
"We need to be aware that we do not build up social explosives and get rid of them in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "New Press" appearing in Hannover.
Not every young person is entitled to the rapid change in social reality.
Bonds, countries and municipalities were already working with the emphasis on solving problems, said Schäuble.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the summit of integration to the Islamic Conference, this is the first success."
However, it is too early for warning.
Schäuble pointed out at the same time that there were no urban and sociological problems in German capitals, as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had suffered severe street fights with the police in the last night.
Car and public buildings were also burned in Toulouse.
Increased integration efforts by the Federal Government also called for the president of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the Krawale in France, Kolat warned against "recognition effects".
The situation in Germany was not as fragile as in France.
However, there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate for young people with a background of migration was "averagely high" under 25 years.
In particular, more training sites should be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We must give young people a perspective."
However, the president of the Turkish municipality added, in Germany more than in France "social control takes place in the families".
In addition, many young people with migration backgrounds did not want to destroy what their parents had built up here.
Kolat warned: "But we still have to be careful."
Young people should be "quickly given the opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet at night in the Paris Voorort Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in use, a helicopter overflew the area with lightning waves.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning mills and cars.
Since the day before today, an offer of about 1,000 security forces will provide for peace.
The police will go through as long as it is necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs.
At night on Tuesday, about 80 policemen were injured at Krawallen in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the evening, the unrest came upon Toulouse.
The Krawale burned down on a traffic accident when two young people were killed on Sunday.
After first finding of the state attorney, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the kingdom of Angela Volke
The de facto appearance of the chancellor shows that the coalition is in the end - and that there is nothing more to be expected of it.
In which country does this federal chancellor actually live?
After their unrestful appearance in the general debate of the German day, which was harsh and inconceivable, one must say: not here - not in the country which you should finally be governed by.
The suggestion that they focus too much on foreign policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel with an angry excessive sentence.
That was provincial, she said, and she only showed that she didn't want to understand what the critics were doing.
In the Federal Day, she has documented how much they have been predicted.
There was neither a particular interest nor even a feeling of concern for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a retired politician who runs into foreign policy and stays there in the vicinity.
For example climate protection: There she is always a praise for the decisions of Saint-damm, but she does not say how to achieve the climate goals in this country.
In any case, self-inflictedness - so much modesty would have failed the CDU leader two years ago.
Now she complains to the floscule that the rise of the humans will occur.
This damages her image as a pragmatician who solves problems instead of making the world beautiful.
But in the realm of Angela Volke, domestic problems are a borderline appearance.
Child poverty and the concerns of the poor?
She's got a few extra points left for it.
It is significant how often she makes a promise when it comes to child abuse.
Three runs need Merkel to produce a semi-trailer sentence.
It sticks like on a foreign land when it becomes concrete.
Division Attakke
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mid Romney provide a hard strike exchange - and now have to fear an external candidate.
The effort of the candidates is already off on the first topic.
He has made New York a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants", in the midst of Romney, Rudy Giuliani proposed.
This, on the other hand, counts with serious assumptions: "I would say that his own house was a port for illegals", rejected Giuliani and suggested to the former governor of Massachusetts to have employed private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blow to the attack: because the Republican base still has no clear preference, the eight presidential advocates use the debate on CNN in particular to discredit their opponents.
The self-turned 30-second videos that have sent Internet users via YouTube are hardly more than a sticker.
"With this kind of isolationism, we have allowed Hitler to come to power," John McCain tells his opponent Ron Paul, who as the only one in the round is calling for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets the Levites to read aloud from the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", an interrogation method that simulates drinking as torture.
However, the fact that the main themes of the campaign are beyond Iraq's war and torture debate shows the reactions of the Salal Public in St. Petersburg in Florida.
Whenever conservative values are always praised and future tax increases are rejected, the audience will be in a state of shock.
Once again it shows where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was touched at the time," explains Romney, "stirred up and offered to the base and television audience a petition that he was still one of the retired advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes to the throat when he is asked, in his opinion, for a literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules for the first time in Civil
One day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani powerman Musharraf was defeated as president.
This will end eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has been eliminated on Thursday for another five-year term of office.
The Pakistani TV exceeded the ceremony in the Presidential Palace of the capital of Islamabad live.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his office as army chief to his trusted Ashfang Kiyani and thus moved from the United States to international pressure in particular.
Eight years after his arrest in an unbled military coup, the former general now rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander of the military forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of the exception, which had suspended the Musharraf on 3 November.
Soon after his release, Musharraf will, according to Advocate General Malik Muhammad Qayum, remove the state of emergency and thus meet a further demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which had occupied the Musharraf after the suspension of the state of emergency in early November with him, rejected all objections to the contested re-election of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others injured in the northern Waziristan tribe in an attack on a military convoy.
According to an army speaker, the bomb exploded on a street near the border to Afghanistan.
The fathers of the Krautrock return
The German supergroup of the 7bziger resounds: The three band members of Harmonia again performed their consoles at a concert in Berlin.
For Revival, an average of its great time "Live 1974" appears.
Already, they were much more famous abroad.
The perceived sensation then occurs in the form of three men set on the evening table.
Everyone has their chests in front of themselves, their cables and, above all, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius thront in the flower white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years of age and owned by Laptop and Guitar.
Right, viewed by the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is concentrated on the console.
Everyone contributes to noise, including a beat.
And sometimes it happens to add to a common piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the Lords themselves.
That the band has remunerated harmony, has provided some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
While it may be revealed here: Targeted requests revealed that the name was difficult through collective pop memory, but not so sustainable to avoid this band painfully for 32 years.
But why should not the German also celebrate his living legends from the 1970s?
At the same time, what is called misleading Krautrock was more and more true in England and America than in their own country.
When the music industry gave the survivors of the Cologne Can group in 2003 the Echo Prize for Life, it was seen in the room in German pop-faced questions.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers even thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and New!, the surprise did not know the limits.
At the concerts Michael Rother later joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage like an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and the statement abroad is one.
That is why the memory is already overpowered with harmony, because the Trio existed only two years and in this time also had a much lower effect than they were subsequently granted by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name Cluster.
At first, they played in the cellar under the Berlin Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had recently helped with the power plant and then played a call as a guitarist at New!, then perhaps the most radical German group.
In 1973, however, Roth followed the Cluster-Musician in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th - century ruins, they lived as city - fledgling municipalities.
Less ideologically than in municipality I, where Roedelius was still allowed to fight as a child girl.
More like a top-level artist.
In the Sperrmüll there was reportedly also a glimpse of the song club Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for art.
Some of them kept harmony from it.
The first album was called "Music of Harmony" and the following "De Luxe".
For so let the music be modest also sound, the band has little material need.
The travel collection was not the only one to use the self-defense.
The CD "Live 1974" now appeared was cut off at a concert in Griesem, in front of a nearly 50-headed record music, as someone thinks to be.
From Rother then came the desire to strengthen harmony and to practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an uncivilous claim.
The band declared its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the Esoteric Spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was relived in the Eighties and has since been more successful than it was in harmony.
The Griessemer live album is to be thanked by Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautruck as the true German contribution to living music.
New! has already been excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of harmony takes place in the Berlin House of the World's Cultures.
Publicly subsidized, within the framework of the Wolftronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, Altpunk and author of the handbook "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the Dr. Motte Loveparade Erfinder.
What would be the entire bandwidth of the influence of the Krautruck on the following pop music?
From harmony, the supergroup's empty space is filled out.
The sentence of Brian Eno swims with the most special sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are images showing producers with harmony in the farm.
Legendal design serves projections of further black and white photographs of revolving devices.
Before that, the three veterans are again concerned with improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and to the drums to unlock unstoppable sounds from the instruments via self-assembled effects devices.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three into the technical deepened humidifier.
The choir of the house doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, it is accommodated and unfurnished under sound clouds and sang at a beautiful place with Emphasis "Aaaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never about Rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in music schools (Can), technologies (power plant) or on the escape from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Whoever calls here "'68!" is not absolutely wrong, and harmony can't get out of it even now.
Even the most self-evident is carefully considered on the stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob one of the nerves, or at the quickest moments, of great happiness.
Richard Gere is simply not cynic enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Killer Peace", two films are once again dealing with the Balkan War.
But they're not convinced.
Either the concepts put too much on action and ballers or they are too moving.
Richard Gere can't help in "The Hunting Party" either.
The good news first: Even though war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but calculated there, in the dark background of the Bosnian war, the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eightties, because too many of the netless roles in women's welfare films and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism have been a source of pleasure.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument, "The Hunting Party - When the Hunter is hunted" (Why should film titles today always be as long and will be as long as lead tariff agreements?) perhaps.
He provides a wonderful eye-winding depiction: In essence, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have been made out of Gere if the fate and film industry were not as convenient: a man who has his best times long ago, but who himself has preserved as a ruinous memory of his downfall even a considerable remnant of the monotonous charm.
But despite this trump, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production "Killer Peace", which also starts this week, only continues the endless series of broken Balkan war films.
With "Killer Peace" you can make a short process: the film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who saves a Serb from Kosovo's hackers, which is still in love with a prompt.
Although it is commendable that at one time the Serbs are not represented here as the only root of all evils, the flat film loses its way too fast in baseball and action.
There remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with war for it.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be found to be very exemplary, why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who are opening up to detect the Serbian top war criminal "the Fuchs" could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and another book writer (both in the Personal Union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories are similar: Both times small teams go into the woods to accomplish something that the military cannot and both times it will be a journey in the mind.
One of the reasons for the defeat of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt does not just let his heart be the downtrodden cynic when he presents us at the beginning.
No, the script must have another romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the river when the reporters have been able to do what Nato, CIA and all the world's leaders have not done in five years: catch the war criminals and leave the Muslim Bosnians to the right race.
This is so bad that you would like to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against cinemalogy.
The film has a very human concern.
He wants to insist that Karadzic and Mladic still run freely, and he suspects that Americans and French (this should be exceptionally agreed) do not pursue the persecution too intensively due to secret political agreements.
But the good community and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "I am sorry to see the fainted stars: how hard it is to be evil".
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly the same shell heads, but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of Balkan war film.
Recently it was reported in this paper that all Iraqi films were big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa film.
Almost always applies: If a star moves around the world's crisis heroes or mine fields, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Archette, "on the other side" with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
Maybe all the conflicts are just too close at the moment.
It had to go on for decades before Hollywood with "Schindler's List" could turn a good movie over the Holocaust.
Some films will probably still be matured - which are now the classic Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have not been celebrated as masterpieces.
But maybe today, where every mass murder in real time comes home on the same two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the writers of the book the carelessness it needs to tell good stories.
"His or none" or "The Great Dictator" have finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Maybe you need to have the sarcastic distant art view of Romancier Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It is only because some things never change.
Cities will always be dangerous, people will always be brutally murdered and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia."
Criticised by Beus for Olympia Absage
The withdrawal of the mayor from Hamburg's application for Olympic Summer Games has been severely criticized in politics and economics.
Many want to continue fighting for the games in the water.
But from Beust, realism encourages the assessment of opportunities.
The chief businessman of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, referred to Wednesday as "not good for the business location".
No other project has recently developed as large motivation forces in the city as the Olympics.
"Without this objective, the sport policy force would not be able to be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to miss the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "getting out of a changed time beam".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole of Beust remained unrealistic in earlier statements, at least until 2028 the Olympics in Hamburg.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Club," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the sports club which was expected for the beginning of December on a Munich application for the Winter Games 2018.
"This preference for us means that we will not have realistic opportunities in the period we have so far considered by 2028."
However, the dream wasn't dreaming all the time, said of Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This will give the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for Olympic games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to build up a chance to complete the plans at this time," HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
A refusal to apply was also in opposition to the Senate's statement on the occasion of a reception for the full assembly of the German High School Sports Association.
There from Beust referred to Hamburg's application for the 2015 Universidad "not as a replacement" for the Hamburg Olympic Games.
The High School Sports Association had only nominated Hamburg last week as a candidate city.
The SPD Citizenship Group proposed to the Senate not to have used valuable time for the construction of the apartment in Hamburg.
"The development of the Small Grassbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has placed on the map of Olympia and expanded the building of the apartment," said SPD Deputy Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Small Grassbrook has always required integrated planning for Olympia and later residential use, the CDU has unilaterally placed on the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics had sparked a great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg was defeated in Leipzig.
They're not Warhol's box.
Whoever connects the terms Sweden and the wooden box is thinking about Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, in Sweden, made wooden boxes cast dark shadows on Warhol's work directory.
Most of the four-twenty-nine Brillo boxes listed there from the "Type Stockholm" are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expresse" some months ago raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxen of the year 1968, internal research at the Modern Museum in Stockholm now comes to a disheartening result: the six "Brillo Boxes", which former museum director Pontus Hultén of the Modern Museum in 1995, has made a donation - and probably also the majority of the approximately one hundred additional Brillo Boxes of the "Type Stockholm", which are in circulation on the international art market.
The history of art and curator productions has been obscured.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the papal cardboard powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his works at the Modern Museum in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of Brillo-boxes from the pope: these were not from Warhol (for cost reasons) but were delivered directly from the Brillo-Cartonagen factory.
It was not about works of art, but about their models, about just exhibitions.
At the same time, Warhol granted permission in 1968 to let some Brillo woodboxes be produced in Sweden, which were not exhibited in the Modern Museum.
Journalists now speak of about fifteen boxes that were then admitted as authorized original Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes with the name "Type Stockholm" to the right in art and auction history.
Some of them have achieved more than $100,000 on auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that it was produced and exhibited in Sweden around a hundred wooden cases in 1968, which Warhol left him.
In fact, Hutén's 105 box was produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Modern Museum, has also examined three of the six Brillo-Boxes in Swedish private possession, two of which were manufactured in Stockholm in 1968: their press trays were first founded and blended, then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
On the other hand, the structure of the 1990 copies betrays that the color with a painting role was applied directly to the press panel without foundation - it is not oil, it is acrylic.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo-Boxes," says the director of the Modern Museum, Lars Nittve, "if the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to another conclusion, the Modern Museum will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
Already in July, the Authentication Board has announced free to go after the "serious charges" that will be raised in matters of soap powder boxes.
But since then, you've been hiding there in unscrupulous silence.
Rebellious soldiers in Manila report
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have given up who have flocked to a hotel in Manila and demanded the storm of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be responsible for any bloodshed, said the rapporteur Antonio Trillanes, who proposed corruption and election fraud, reporters at the hotel.
Government-owned soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under Trengengas use.
The approximately two dozen soldiers had slipped into the building for hours.
Around half of them stood before the court on Thursday because of a failed pout trial in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the negotiation to end up suddenly with about 30 sympathies.
The military policemen who were actually supposed to watch him were obviously passing over to him and joined his maternity.
They entered the Pennsylvania Hotel and demanded the storm of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops shut down the area around the front hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"The people have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who previously commissioned the elite unit of Scout Rangers, said that other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Government critics had called for large demonstrations against the President on Friday.
Its government has been overestimated for months of corruption.
Manila's financial district was already the main venue of the tried matrimonials of about 200 military members against Arroyo in 2003.
The rebellion took place after almost 24 hours of refusing to join the army.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder at Versatel
United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent of the telecom company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as reported by the company on Wednesday evening.
I'm going to keep 20.05 percent of the basic capital.
An acquisition had been speculated before.
You keep the option open to increase the share of Versatel.
With this step, you want to advance the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet reported.
Earlier on Wednesday, a rise in bribery had already occurred, after the Berenberg Bank increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator by another 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The House held only the shares for a third party, called it on the financial market.
On the previous day, the United Internet had already participated with almost 10 percent of its mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares in value of 106.4 million euros.
5.15 million shares of them purchased United Internet for EUR 31.4 million.
In addition, companies have held discussions on marketing cooperation for DSL and mobile radio products.
"We strengthen our partnership," explained a United Internet speaker.
The two companies have established the Community company MSP to take over the competitors Freenet.
First, the two companies want to satisfy themselves with a share of good ten percent to Freenet and do not use their right to take over another 18.49 percent to Freenet, the United Internet reported on Thursday.
However, the two companies kept all options open, in particular to further increase their participation in the Freenet AG, it said.
Discussions between the United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership were completed in mid-November.
The ongoing and still hard-to-see poker around Freenet has been part of the consolidation of the German telecom market for months.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile phone clients and 1.27 million DSL and complete connection customers.
The holding of United Internet and Drillisch has so far held at 6,01% of the Freenet shares.
Now it has been agreed that Drillisch will bring about four percent more.
The right to purchase Vatas, which is 18.49 percent of the investment company, was already agreed in August.
