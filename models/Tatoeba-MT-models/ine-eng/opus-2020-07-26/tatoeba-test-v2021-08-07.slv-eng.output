You're drinking again.
You've been making a mistake lately.
You've been making a mistake lately.
You ate.
You ate.
You prayed with me.
You prayed with.
You prayed with me.
You were studying.
You were studying.
One day, it's gonna be a hate.
One day you'll be fine.
You're gonna be a beautiful mother-in-law on the sea.
You'll be a beach worker.
You wrote a book!
Njam!
