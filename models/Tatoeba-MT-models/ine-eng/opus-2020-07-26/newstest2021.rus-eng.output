Semilarically against the prosecutor's office: the cassation of the former vice mayor of Tartu will be considered on 4 August
This means that a decision on it is likely to be made early in September.
The courts of the first two courts refused to consider the Semillarski claim, but in April his cassation complaint was brought before the State Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the complainant, as it was not authorized by the Administrative Court.
The Court ruled that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for the damage caused in criminal proceedings.
“These matters must be handled by the Prosecutor ' s Office and the Court of Justice”, explained earlier to the correspondent of the ERR Press Secretary of the Tartu Court, Anette Creatsmann.
She said that Valvo Semilarski had complained about the decision in the district court, which on 5 February had not changed the judgment of the Court of First Instance.
Now he will have to say his word.
According to the defendant Samilarski, a sworn lawyer, Oliver Neaes, his client was unreasonably suspected of being in custody for about two years.
He now demands the prosecutor ' s office to reject the false allegations to his address and to compensate him for his moral damage.
In October 2017, Samilarski, together with others, was arrested by Tartu's Deputy Mayor, Artem Suwarov, on suspicion of several crimes.
“Remember, when I was detained, the Security and Public Prosecutor's Police immediately organized a press conference and informed the whole of the Estonian Republic that the Tartu leaders, one of the most influential local authorities, were sold.
Those airtight public suspicions accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have proved false, the prosecutor's office has nothing to say about it," said Semilarski in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Neaes, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecutor ' s office was to operate.
"The claim of taking and selling has proved false, but this is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its decisions on Russia, as well as in Lithuania, that during the investigation, representatives of States should be cautious in the choice of words so that suspects would not be represented in the role of criminals prior to the judgement.
The prosecutor's office is also bound by the presumption of innocence, which was unfortunately not respected in this case against Valvo Samilarski," Neaes said.
“The public representation of Semilarski as a serious offender and receiver in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of the recipient are still unacceptable is contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the applicant”, added the lawyer.
As Rus.err.ee wrote, the former Deputy Mayor of Tartu Valvo Semilarski would not be held liable for the charges against him - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official is charged with a deliberate violation of anti-corruption legislation in the conduct of transactions in particular large sizes.
According to the indictment, from 2015 to 2017, the former Deputy Mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in the city court meetings in making decisions relating to Tartu's existing companies, with owners or managers of whom Semilarski had been actively involved at the personal level at the outside time.
According to Gross, in all these cases, Semilarski had personal interests and therefore it had to be excluded from taking decisions.
Earlier, as wrote by Rus.err.ee, the Prosecutor ' s Office had filed Semillar suspicions of receiving and violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions in particular large sizes.
This happened in October 2016 when he was arrested along with another Deputy Mayor, Artem Suwarovov (Centrist Party).
At that time, the Prosecutor ' s Office and the Security Police stated that there was strong evidence against both Deputy Mayors.
After that, the two officers resigned.
The Suvorov case was later brought before a court that had fully justified the policy.
The trial in the Valvo Semilarski case is still ongoing.

How the CBC's decision to reduce the key rate affects the economy
The Bank of Russia is expecting a resurgence of the key rate.
It dropped by another 0.25 per cent, up to 4.25 per cent of the annual, formally regular historical minimum.
In view of the return of a short decline in the rate, as well as the tonality of the CB statements and updated forecasts on the Russian economy, the regulator will look at economic prospects more optimistic than before.
This means that the current cycle of money-credit policy mitigation can soon be stopped.
"We have continued to mitigate monetary policy, especially given that inflation is still at risk below 4 per cent in 2021," reported the head of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiulin.
They are linked to a significant decline in economic activity, a fall in domestic and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, according to Nabiullin, will take more than half a year.
It noted, however, that, following the removal of the restrictions resulting from the pandemic, economic processes were revived: energy consumption, consumer demand and investment, increased construction and issue of consumer goods, slowed the annual traffic down, and promulgated.
According to the CBC, the reduction in the economy in 2020 would be 4.5-5.5% (4-6 per cent expected) and the recovery growth in the economy in 2021 would be 3.5-4.5 per cent, and 2.5-3.5 per cent in 2022.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised its annual oil price forecast to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021 respectively.
In the past, the CB was expecting $27 and $35 for a barrel.
Finally, the Russian Bank's 2020 inflation forecast was 3.7-4.2% against the previous expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view of the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which draws us closer to the end of the mitigation cycle, the economists of Russia and the CIS Renesan Capital, Sofia Donez and Andrei Melaštenko.
Yes, the Bank of Russia has consistently reduced the key rate for more than a year and has dropped by 3.5 per cent since the beginning of last summer.
At the last meeting in June, the CB immediately reduced it to one percentage point due to low inflation rates due to the sudden demand and the need to stimulate the slowed by the pandemic and associated constraints of the economy.
The chances of monetary policy adjustment are maintained (at the next meeting on 18 September and by the end of the year), but the border is already close, and the main analyst, Rosbank Evgenie Koschelev, agrees.
The pool of pro-inflation risks also indicates the proximity of the break in the reduction of the percentage policy - broken supply chains, the potential cost increase due to prevention measures and faster recovery of demand (as expected), he said.
In conclusion, the Bank of Russia will need more attention to inflation processes during the harvest season, as well as the external volatility that has increased in the face of geopolitical conflicts, Koschelev points out.
Thus, a decrease in the key rate would lead to a further reduction in the rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as perhaps in the mortgage, said the senior economist of the Open Bank analyst Maxim Petronovic.
The adjustment of rates would be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, he explained.

The authorities of Sub-Moscow told about the fate of closed mines
In Sub-Moscow, landfills of solid household waste continue to be closed.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the last.
Some of the 39 existing landfills are modernized in modern waste treatment plants.
But this option is not possible for every polygon, many of which have grown with a flat housing.
After the polygon is closed, it stands for recuperation - the body of the polygon is resuspended by ground, the degasation and removal systems are installed.
This allows the chemical processes to be stopped inside the dump, so that it does not burn, and does not cause any harm, and does not poison soil and groundwater.
And then the ex-capture continues to raise a useless dog in the middle of her living room.
Why don't you do something useful?
For example, in Russia, where the recuperation of the Annano field was literally completed in the days, the authorities consider making the dog a mountain swan.
This polygon, which was operated from 1976 to 2016, has expanded beyond the borders of its land.
Therefore, in the case of recuperation, neighboring areas had to be purchased, which had long been killed by a mosquito under siege.
"Sometimes will pass, the polygon will come, and we will think what we can do to get it to benefit.
It's a mountain resort," told reporters in the head of the Russian district of Nikolai Parfenov.
Two polygons will become renewable energy recovery sites
The "Torbeevo" and "Timohovo" fields in the Bogorod district will be places for the recovery of renewable energy from natural and natural gas.
Torbeeva will be launched by the end of the year, a gas station capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatts of electricity per year and about 0.95 gigacalories of heat energy, which will provide its own needs for the polynomial supply of administrative and production facilities.
"Timochovo" will produce 72.5 million kilowatts and continue to work as a musero-processing complex.

Beautiful high minerals only decorated Ayah-Sofia
Once again about Ayah-Sofia, the text of Vladimir Zelinski has come to light, which, please, must be protested.
First of all, there's been a free way in!
I wasn't in Istanbul, but in God's House, it's better a free entrance than a free entrance.
Second, Muslims have won this land just as honestly as the Orthodox have won the Volgo-Oxy conflict, the Muslim Caucasian (and set up churches in Grosno) and planted apples on Mars.
God help!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered the United States.
We'll all be back?
You don't think there are any linguists who will need to return their capital to the site of the Ten Church?
Third, Muslims have improved this building, invested in it.
That is, it's like the factories and premises that the lions have chosen from the bourgeoises to own, it belongs to the Putins and other nomenclatures.
They've improved everything from Kremlin to Angara, so that's all they've got under the law of the progressives.
The beautiful high-minerets were very beautiful to Ayah-Sofia, very.
She was a stupid blacksmith, a stupid blacksmith with beautiful minerals.
Fourthly, there are no "Islamic" and "Regal" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are the hypocrites, and there are the hypocrites, and there are those who are united in faith and hypocrisy.
A believer in the categories of civilization will not think.
It's the thinking of a British mid-Tunby officer who believes it's hard to think.
And to the one who believes everywhere in prayer.
And always.
He who believes does not pray except to be removed from a place other than that from which he is called, and he prays.
He is the one who believes, and is not unconcerned.
We're snakes, not rocks.
