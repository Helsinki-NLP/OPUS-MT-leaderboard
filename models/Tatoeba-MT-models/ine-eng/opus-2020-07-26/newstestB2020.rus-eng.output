Half Defender Rubina Paul Mogilevez told us the reasons for the failed team game.
The Russians suffered four defeats in a row, as well as their departures from Cuba.
We're in the middle of every game, they're quoting Mogilev's report.
So each of us needs to think about the causes of such a failure.
Further meetings are needed to prepare and correct the situation.
How?
If we knew, we'd probably fix it.
But first of all, I think we need to add to the component like unanimity.
I think we have a problem with that.

China strongly opposes the adoption by the United States of the Tibetan Bill
China strongly opposes the adoption by the United States of the so-called Tibetan Bill, which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of three Chinese-American joint communiqués.
On Friday, the official representative of the Office of the Gossovet of the PRC on the cases of Taiwan, Ma Siagouan, stated.

China must be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be halted by any or any forces, said Ma Siagouan.
TikTok hides bad videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years of age
China / Reuters image
The Chinese Social Network TikTok is censored by the video industry, which mentions the Tianjanmen area, the independence of Tibet or the banned religious group Fallungun, reports The Guardian.
The documents published show that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance company) is promoting China's foreign policy by means of the annex.
The main part of the violations related to China's policy is "inflammation of hatred".
In each case, TikTok has unfavourable publications in the context of general rules so that social networking does not look censored.
For example, the ban on the criticism of China's socialist system falls under the general prohibition of "criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.".
The ban on the mention of incidents in the areas of Tianjanmen or genocide in Cambodia falls under "the history of China or other countries".
The document also lists the names of the 20 “foreign leaders or government officials”, including North Korean leaders Kim Chen Ira, Kim Ir Sen and Kim Chen In, Indian policy Mahatm Ganda, US Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Sindzo Abe, South Korean President Park Qan Hi, President of Indonesia Joco Vidodo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as indicated in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Publications from the first category are removed by the administrators of the network and may lead to the user being blocked.
Such publications remain on the site but are limited to TikTok algorithms.
Representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer applied: "We now use a localized approach to modernization, as well as attracting independent local specialists."
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publications, the founder of the "Producer Centre" by Rust Boddanov.
"Producer Centre" is a Russian media company that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All the advertising materials of the bloggers "Producer Centre" are in agreement with the representatives of the network, but the user materials can be placed without agreement, and Bogdanov is passed on.
On the question of whether TikTok can be expressed about politics or Putin, Bogdanov has a strong responsibility and says he has seen such publications.
The founder of Our Didgital Roman Zaripov agrees with Bogdanov: "The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: no shocking content, discriminating statements and so on."
But under these rules, any content that does not like moderators can be subjected to notice of Zaripov.
Zaripova Agency is another Russian partner TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years of age.
Under the user agreement, TikTok can only be used by persons over 13 years of age.
Network administrators check their age with artificial intelligence: neuropathy analyzes individuals and determines how many years a person looks, explains Bogdanov.
If nervousness decides that the user is younger, his account can be removed, he adds.
According to the RBC, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow in September 2019 in WeWork.

I can't go back yet!

Russians warned of false bank calls
In Russia, there has been an increase in the number of phone calls from frauds that replace the bank's phone number.
This is reported by the Commercentus with reference to the Central Bank data.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator communicated to the communications operators more than 2.5 thousand numbers from which clients were called to different financial organizations.
In 189 cases, operators found a sub-number.
Another 218 numbers were blocked, and in 59 cases a restriction on the use of financial services was imposed.
The deputy head of the information security department, CB Artem Sichev, told us that a large number of Russian banks had met with the bribery.
He explained that operators did not always respond to the Bank's warnings about fraudulent telephone calls, referring to the lack of such a duty in the Communications Act.
In the Open Bank, Rosbanke and Alpha Bank confirmed information on the increase in fake phone numbers.
As reported in the Bilaina press release, a part of the information on the fake phone calls transmitted by the CB was incorrect: the lists contain the numbers that are actually used by banks to communicate with clients.
Their blocking would lead to failure in the organization's work.
Artem Sichev told us that the Central Bank is planning to establish a number base for fraud, to which the liaison operator will address each call to check the number.
He explained that amendments to the legislation would be required to establish such a base.

Barcelona blackmails Nimara
The Spanish Barcelona and its former Brazilian footballer, Neimar, are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the French attacker Pari St.
The case was almost brought before the court, but the Catholics suggested that the game be resolved without interference from Femida.
Otherwise they will deny it.
Neimar and his clever father, who is also a Brazilian agent, took an interesting focus: in agreement with Barrso, who signed the game in 2016, he had to receive 40 million euros.
However, literally a year later, the Forvard appeared in the GSP for a record of 222 million euros.
Nevertheless, he has received 22 million from Catholics and now wants to take the remaining 18.
In addition, Brazilian lawyers insist that the club should pay him even interest for the delay of payment.
When it became known in the capital of Catalonia about Nimara's claims, Barcelona filed a meeting claim.
"Sine-Granate" insists that the bonus was based on the entire contract - from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club considers that the game was worth only a quarter of €40 million and requires the return of the proportion of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that, in the summer of Naimar and Bars, they almost agreed to return the "crazy" game to the fate of Catalonia.
True, the deal failed, but the hope for the return of the Forvard remains.
And this is what Sports.Ru says with reference to the insulators, the lawyers of the club told the players that if the financial claims issue is not settled in a pre-trial manner, it would rule out the possibility of returning the Brazilian.
Naaman himself wanted to return so much that he asked for assurances that the Catholics would buy him back.
Mart Laar: EKRE members to the advice of the Bank of Estonia do not enter
ECRE members were not and will not be invited to the Council.
The advice of the Bank of Estonia is based on the conclusions on the trust of the Estonian State.
Until the ECRE members continue to act as they first speak and then think that none of them will be invited to the Board of Banks.
"The President of the Council of the Bank of Estonia cannot apologize for the statements made by members of the Council," Laar said in an interview with Delfi, transmitting the ERR message portal.
Laar noted, however, that ECRE was represented at meetings of the Eesti Pank Council.
The current seventh composition of the Board of the Bank of Estonia includes Laara, Lina Tinnisson, Kaye Kerem, Urmas Varblane, Kalev Kallo, Janus Tamkivi (Reform Party), Ann Lester and Rein Minka.
On the proposal of Laara, two members of the board, Kallo and Tinisson, were to be replaced by Anna Eesmaa (Centrist Party) and Ivar Padara (Social Democratic Party).
At the same time, the Reform Party wished that, instead of Yaanus Tamkivi, Andres Sutt would be in the council.
But Laar replied that the aim of the Reform Party was to get two seats on the advice of the Bank of Estonia, so that, apart from Yaanus Tamkivi, Andres Sutt would also be in the advice.
On Tuesday, 24 September, Riigikogu rejected Laara's proposal to appoint new members of the Bank of Estonia Council.

Soccer Paul Mamaev, released last week from the UDO colony, will not return to the Krasnodar football club.
The former advocate of this club can soon sign a contract with FC Rostov, as reported by the Championship portal.
According to the publication, the negotiations between representatives of Rostov and Mamieva are now in the process of completion.
It is assumed that a contract with a 31-year-old footballer will be signed for two years with the possibility of extending for another season.
Sport-Express writes that the day before, Pavel Mamayev had to undergo medical examinations in Moscow's Dinom, but the check did not take place because of the "unspecified situation in the club".
"Craznodar" broke a contract with Momaev last week on the agreement of the parties.
Half-protector has been playing for the Reddish club since 2014.
With the team, he won the bronze of the Russian champion twice.

A man with a samurai sword tried to resist found in the garbage dog's body
A resident of the American city of Oakland Park, Florida, was arrested on charges of attempted murder after a samurai sword struck on his opponent in a dispute over the body mass found.
The 54-year-old Curtis Miller (Curtis Miller) was buried in a trash can near a deserted house.
That's what Todd Beavers noticed at the evening party.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black body among the discards.
Miller saw the Bevers find and was upset.
He thought he could claim to be in the morgue, since the first one started digging in the trash.
Men started arguing.
Suddenly, Bevers caught up with her and ran away from her home.
Then Miller took his sword from the same dog, samurai, and went after the opponent.
He killed Bivers around his house.
Miller pulled a sword out of his knife and began to blow them in the direction of the kidnapper.
Bivers told Miller that he was recording on the video.
Seeing the video camera, Miller ran away, but threatened to come back.
Bivers left a body in the yard and went into the house.
Soon thereafter, he found that an unknown woman had entered his court and had taken away the corpse, shouting insults.
The police are already looking for Miller to drive a car without rights.
The man was detained, charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the American city of Hardston, New Jersey, the manager of the hedge fund attacked an unknown woman and wounded her with a sword.
So he responded to the fact that the guests at the wedding that they had celebrated at the same hotel where he had stopped did not allow him to smoke.
Mass disorder per three
The Moscow case against the participants in the summer protests is more pronounced on individual fragments and is losing political momentum.
The evidence of the very fact that "mass disorder" did not hold back, but in the absence of a political decision to put this case down on the brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the removal of the charges.
The breakdown of the case must be encouraging to society, but it will probably leave to the extreme annoyance of the silhouettes whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence were in vain.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining accused under article 212 C.E. (mass disorder) - Alexei Minjaylo was unexpectedly released from custody without any obligation, and a few more hours later and completely rehabilitated: the DRC withdrew the charge.
Last year, nearly two months after his arrest, several professional communities — historians, priests, and literarys — joined him.
Thereafter, there were only two accused of mass disorder (originally 13): Sergey Fomin, transferred to domestic detention on 3 September, and Samariddin Rajabov, who had been arrested by the court before the end of December (he was also accused of violence against the representative of the authority, article 318 C.).

He also added that there was usually less punishment than they were asking for.
The collection of signatures on Latvia's accession to the United States was organized in 2016.
At the same time, at the same time, Latvia's accession to the Galactic Empire and the country's exit from the Solar System and the Milky Way have been collected on the website.
It is noted that a criminal case has been initiated with regard to Bartecco under the first paragraph of article 82 of the Criminal Law of the country, “Public appeal for a breach of the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia”.
In 2016, the author of the Internet petition for Latvia's accession to Russia received half of the prison.

The Russian IMF proposes to punish police officers on the Internet
The Ministry of the Interior of Russia has prepared amendments to the Police Act to protect the order against the spread of false information and their contempt for information on the Internet.
On Friday, a request for a public discussion of the bill was made on the federal legal portal, but the draft document had not yet been published.
The explanatory note to the document notes that it is being developed in connection with the need for the protection of the honor and dignity of a police officer from “proliferation into information and communication networks, including the Internet,” information of a derogatory nature, including discriminatory nature.
The exact way in which it is intended to protect the police from fraud in the network is not specified.
However, the document explains that the provisions of the amendments will be applied “by way of individualization of the mechanism”, already provided for by the law on blocking posts that offend representatives and the law on penalties for such posts.
Both laws entered into force in March of this year.
The final text of the bill will be published after public discussions and an independent anti-corruption expert.
According to the explanatory note, the amendments to the Police Act should enter into force in January 2020.
On 18 March, President Vladimir Putin signed a law on punishment for “clear disrespect for the State” on the Internet.
According to this document, Roskonaszor warns against a violation resource and gives it a day to eliminate it.
For the first violation of the prohibitions, a fine of between 30 and 300 thousand rubles is provided and for the reintroduction of administrative arrest for up to 15 days.
On 12 April, the Russian Federation first applied this rule to media by blocking the Warsaw edition 76.ru.
Soon thereafter, the Grand District Court of the region of New York City fined the local population for 30 thousand rubles for placing on the network “two records of information in an inappropriate form that abuses human dignity and public morality and expresses a manifest disrespect for society, the State, the authorities of State power in the FP.”

Housing credit rates in Russia will be reduced by the end of 2019.
The Director General of the Dom.rf Credit Organization, Alexander Plutnik, reports the Interfax.
As Plutnik pointed out at the Ministry of Russia College, the majority of banks will conduct another cycle of lower mortgage rates over the past months and the average market rate will be 8.9 per cent, the level of the national project "Gil and the urban environment".

Earlier in September, it was known that one of the largest Russian mortgage market players - Sberbank - planned to carry out another reduction in housing credit rates by the end of 2019.
Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help to prolong youth?
The topic of phytoandrogen has been studied poorly.
One of the most famous is the base dust.
Phytoestrogens have been studied and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain diseases associated with age (including heart and heart disease, some types of cancer).
Known sources of phytoestrogen are all beaver (popular soybean), cloud, salt seeds.
On the other hand, many experts believe that such BADs cannot fully replace natural hormones.
The possible harm from such additions cannot be excluded.
For example, in the light of their adoption, the production of their own hormones may be reduced by too many analogues outside the body.
The Verenteniks called for the return of the Kazakhstann "Jenice".
The former attacker "Rotor" and Russian assembly Oleg Veretennikov joined the action to re-establish Kazakhstan's "Venice".
The club from Astana, which was called "Dinamo", "Celinik", "Astana" and "Jenice", was organized in 2014.
Verenteniks protected its colour in 2004 and 2008.
“I knew about the action to restore the Genis football club, organized by his patients.
And he couldn't stay on the side!
I spent half a season in this club.
It was not the best time for results and funding, but I will never forget this club and its loyal patients who have always been with the team!
It'll always be in the memory and stadium of Munitapasov, where I killed my 200th ball in my career!
"Gennis" must be born!
He's got a lot of history and great sick people.
I wish them the best, and I believe that the people of the city will return to their homeland."
The Bastion complex started on the Onicks rocket.
For the first time, the mines launched a winged rocket from the Bastion complex in Chukotke.
"Onics" started off at a distance of 350 kilometers, and 200 of them flew over the land, which is a record for this type of missile.
The safety of firearms has been provided by about 10 warships and ships of the Pacific Fleet, as well as by seaplanes, reported to the Department of Information and Mass Communications of the IOM.
The Bastion complex has never been used in Chukotka before.
Hydrometer named the faithful folk monuments
Russia has many peoples who are trying to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
At the Hydrometre, all the notes that are likely to work have been checked.
Meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can really be trusted in the short term.
As Dr. Roman Wilfand of Russia's Hydrometre director said, if the sun is red during the sunset, the next day will indeed be as hot as our ancestors noted.
And if the sky is whitened, on the Day of Resurrection it will rain.
The second working note is based on bird surveillance.
More often than not, if they fly low, it's usually raining.
This is simply because when the humidity is high, the muscles are wet with wings and the feathers are forced to lower to catch insects, says the TAC.
On different continents, there are people's monuments.
Surka Day is a traditional folk holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on 2 February.
It is believed that this day should be followed by a surrogate coming out of its norm in order to determine the time of spring.
Unidentified oil Fridays were discovered on the north-east beaches of Brazil
The oil spills of unknown origin were found on 99 north-east beaches in Brazil.
Pollutants were scattered two thousand kilometres from the shoreline.
Communications of the first discovered oil-fifty began to take place on the second September.
Every day, however, up to Thursday, as well as territorial coverage, they continued to increase.
The Brazilian Institute of the Environment conducted a chemical analysis of detected samples.
It turns out that they're all identical and this is about crude oil.
In the State Oil Corporation of Petrobras, which was transferred to the analysis of the samples found, it stated that they did not, in their opinion, correspond to the oil obtained from locations in the territory of Brazil.
"It's a thick oil.
It may be discharged from one of the vessels after the tank has been cleaned.
Many continue to do so.
And it is likely to fall into the ocean during the period," said the Brazilian news portal G1 coordinator of the oil industry union of Pernambuku and Paraiba Rojerio Almeida.
He also added that, despite the prohibition of this practice, many ships continue to waste in the open sea.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states in the north-east of the country, environmental defenders discovered nine sea turtles completely covered with oil traps.
Only two of them survived.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Institute of the Environment, together with Petrobras, will begin cleaning contaminated beaches.
As long as specialists recommend that tourists and locals go round the oil tank on the fifth side and report on all the pollution that has been detected.

The business community required the removal of the existing SPNs, and the Rossustzauzer said a joint development of new ones.
The list included 33 agencies.
By 2021, however, it was intended to reduce the number of health standards and rules by 40 times.

The Russians don't want to retire - B. Matvinko
The Speaker of the Council of the Federation, Valentina Matvinko, believes that the Russians do not have sufficient stockpiles to fully earn the draft guaranteed pension product in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions from private collections in the world is quite widespread.
Another case is how timely it is.
“In my view, a large part of the population now has incomes from which they simply have nothing to spend on increasing pension provision in the future,” said B. Matvienko.
The Russians, in the view of the speaker, cannot understand the mechanisms for the formation and assessment of the pension, since “the constant changes in this area have finally been confused”.
This does not mean that I am opposed to improving the pension system that regulates its legislation.
"Russia is a social State, and we are obliged to do everything we can to improve the size of pensions, social protection of citizens.
But steps in this direction must be smart, responsible, taking into account national realities," said B. Matvinenko "RA News".
The Head of the FSF stressed that if this initiative (the draft law on guaranteed pension product) is to develop, several basic principles, including voluntaryity, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and the responsibility of the State to ensure the preservation of pension stocks, should be provided.
On 6 September, the Ministry of Finance announced that the draft Pension Guaranteed Product Act (GDP) had been approved.
Among its main elements is the voluntary arrangement for citizens to join the stockpiles system, the preservation of long-term pension stocks by the State, the registration of the stockpiles by the central administrator, the tax benefits for business and the tax benefits for citizens.

Sony and Disney made a deal.

One of the most famous comics heroes, the Human Pauk, will remain in a filmed Marvel.
Disney and Sony Pictures have been able to agree on the rights to use it in French films.
This is known from the Sony press release, which says that the third part of the Human Pauka with Tom Holland will be screened on July 16, 2021.
Previously it was reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not reach a income-sharing consensus, which would lead to the leaving of a film-based Marvel.
Sony has the rights to the filmmaker.
She gave them to the Marvel movie rental, which belongs to Disney.
As a result, Sony received incomes from the movies and Disney from souvenirs and toys.
At some point, it was reported that Disney had ceased to exist, and the company wanted to review the agreement.
President Marvel Studios Kevin Faygi said he was furious.
Surprisingly, the journey of Spider-Man to filmed Marvel will continue.
"All of us at Marvel Studios are very happy to be able to continue working on it.
A human spider is a sign figure.
It's a hero whose history affects all generations and audiences around the world," he says in his press release.
Faygi recalled that Sony was also creating his own movie house, which was built around the Spider-Man.
"So it happened that he was the only superpower given by a hero who appeared in different cinemas.
So while Sony continues to develop his own community-wide Speedy, the future can predict unexpected surprises," he noted.
Tom Holland, who played the Man of the Spider in five films, apparently commented on the news, posted in his "Instagram" account a section of the "Wolk with Wall Street" movie, where hero Leonardo de Caprio shouts "I'm not leaving!"
Information on the contradictions between companies appeared in August.
According to the media, Disney wanted to receive half the cash receipt from Human Pauke films, provided that both companies would pay half of the cost of painting production.
But it didn't set Sony up.
The news of the possible departure of a beloved superhero from filmed Marvel caused anger among many loyal worshipers.
Details of the new conditions have not yet been disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement, but stated: “We have worked beautifully for the past four years, and our joint desire to continue working together has been commensurate with the wishes of many fans [Human-Paucus].
We're glad we can move forward together."
The film "Mestrels: Final", the united Human Pauka, Thora, Halka and other Marvel superheroes, became the most cash in the history of the world filmmaker, moving from the first place "Avatar".

The expert told me why he had to give up tea in packages.
The team of scientists from Canada representing the University of McGill found that more than ten billion microplastic particles fall in the cup in five minutes.
The bottled drink can also add particles of the eyelids, according to the National News Food Safety Expert Elizabeth Tihonov.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot obtain reliable information on the composition of the packaged tea - the manufacturer may add ingredients that will not be included in the package.
The beers at the end of the season do not pick out, so they can be in the tea.
"More importantly, the packages do not always include tea plants," Tihonova said.
She said that it would be better to refuse the use of such a drink for the benefit of the tea for development sold in specialized stores.
She also stressed that the risk of packaging tea was not only in its composition, but also in its production method, micro-organisms heat up to high temperatures, which could lead to the distribution of harmful substances.
"The best thing is to buy pure green or black tea, which will be the least of the additions," said the expert.

Regions were invited to share business support secrets
As noted in the "Parliamentary newspaper", on 27 September, the Chairman of the Committee of the Council of the Federation on Economic Policy, Andrew Kutepov, sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development, Maxim Oreskin, and to the Minister of Finance, Anton Silovanov, proposing to express his position on the initiatives of the Federation's actors to improve legislation in support of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
It is time to establish interregional relations
The Committee of the Council of the Federation on Economic Policy has compiled information from the regions on the business development and legalization of self-employed persons and on the outcome of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions told the senators about the problems of the development of SMEs and submitted proposals to improve the existing legislation.
"To date, communication between regions has not been sufficiently established, and the business community in all regions has identified the lack of information on regional entrepreneurship development programmes in the country as a whole," noted Andrey Kutepov.
In the annex to the letter addressed to the Government, he presented a set of positive contributions from regions for the legalization of self-employment and consolidated data from regions with proposals and issues (recorded).
In addition to its own ministries, the compilations from the regions are also directed to the executive heads of the regional authorities.
The exchange of information on positive work in the regions could give a measure of entrepreneurship in general.
The first step towards such an exchange will be to provide the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy," said the Senator of Parliament.

In a number of other regions, special support measures are being taken for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed continue to withdraw from the shadows
In the opinion of the regional authorities, a number of changes to existing legislation should be made to better support for small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, the Archangel region has proposed replacing the term “self-employment” with “business activities”, since it is “the most appropriate content of the public service to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
In the Ivanov area, amendments were considered necessary to expand the list of activities undertaken by self-employed citizens, including activities relating to the division and repair of residential facilities, roofing facilities, physical training.
The Brasian region considers it important to strengthen control of the poor dairy producers through the Mercuria veterinary system.
In the Kostromian and Magadan areas, the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and of social entrepreneurship are being reinforced in the legal and regulatory field.
All proposals from regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific legislation.
"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes for support for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific legislative projects," assured Andrey Kutepov.

Internet users who use airline services have come to the fore since the introduction.
Some of them thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines had to do the same.
One of the Southers complained that a few weeks ago he was traveling from New York to Doha and was sitting next to him with three crying children.

The "licensing" items in Russia fell 100 times
In the RF Government, the supply of agricultural and food to Russia from countries falling under the Russian food embargo was estimated to have declined more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to President Vladimir Putin, 31 thousand tonnes of products were imported from the sanctions countries in the first half of 2019 against 3 million 442.2 thousand tonnes for the same period in 2013, according to Interfax.
The value of the imported product was reduced to $226.5 million from $4 billion to $975.5 million respectively.
It's about the supply of goods that didn't fall under the embargo.
As indicated in the report, the volume of imports prohibited has been offset by increased imports from CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia, Serbia.
Recall that, at the end of August, the Government extended until 31 December 2020 the period for the destruction of agricultural, raw materials and foodstuffs prohibited from imports into Russia under the anti-dumping measures.
The document on the official legal information portal noted that the time limit for the rules had been extended for another year, from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
The original action of the order on the destruction of the licence was extended to production from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, on 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Ukraine, from 1 January 2016.
The Putin ' s order for the destruction of illegal imports into the country of "authorization" (products falling under the food embargo imposed by Moscow in response to the Western anti-racial sanctions) entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the Government has authorized the destruction of “licensive” food in any legal way.
As the sanctions were maintained in the West, the FP also extended its response.
However, the measure does not apply to products imported by citizens for personal use.
The prohibition does not apply to imports of goods for personal consumption up to 5 kg.
However, the head of the Council, President of the RF for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights, Michael Fedotov, previously called the destruction of food simply immoral, and that, he said, had a negative impact on human education.
Furthermore, in early June, the Rosustrustrate checked with an initiative to prevent the destruction of food suitable for use.
Thereafter, the Human Rights Council, with President RF, issued a similar recommendation to the Government.
And Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Gordeev said that destroying food products was wrong, and we should think about how to use them for appointment, assessing quality.

In Chile, a cost of 1 billion euros began to be built
This is reported by the TAC with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
As ESO reports, this week the construction of a building dome where the E-ELT Telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) will be located, the "European Superb Telescope", is the most expensive and ambitious astronomical project.
Its total value, estimated by ESO, will exceed EUR billion.
Most of this money will be spent on the construction of equipment and construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record large mirror, with a diameter of approximately 39 meters.
It will be collected from 798 hexagonal segments of 1.4 metres.
This huge mirror, as well as two supporting surfaces with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help E-ELT get the first detailed photographs of the planet outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and search for Earth's twins.
In addition, scientists are trying to use this observatory for observation of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the centre of the Milky Way.
Although the construction of the dome is only started, mirrors, scientific tools and other components of the observatory have been developed by scientists, engineers and other specialists for three years since the announcement of the first E-ELT construction plans.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose total value was around 400 million euros, was awarded by the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
