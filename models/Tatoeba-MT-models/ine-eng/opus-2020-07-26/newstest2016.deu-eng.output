Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly.
The two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and the destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
At the meeting, however, it is also intended to address the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-State resolution under discussion.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been strained for years.
Washington criticises the ongoing settlement of Israel and advocates Netanyahu's lack of will in the peace process.
Because of Obama's deal on the Iranian nuclear program, the relationship between the two continued to deteriorate.
In March, Netanyahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republicans before the US Congress, which was partially assessed as a front against Obama.
The speech was not in agreement with Obama, and this meeting had indicated that he had rejected the choice he had made in Israel at the time.
In a hurry, Professor, have shot his girlfriend
In an emergency, Professor Shannon Lamb told with a somewhat curious voice of the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the house the officers found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten note that was criticised on a white block: "I am so sorry, I wanted to make it go away, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school site where, according to the police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university employees heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said Lamb had made the impenetrable emergency sometime after.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took his life when the police threw him in.
One day after the shooting at the university, the students and teachers forced themselves to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him said, helped to draw an image of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal precedent.
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, where he mentioned the "wonderful people", with which he shared his academic life.
Both were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, which includes 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some trends in problematic behaviour.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised the Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that at the end of the academic year 2014-15 he had to deal with stress.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for permission for health reasons and said he had any health problems.
This year he taught only two online courses.
The latest changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion for which the Lamb had worked so hard would not guarantee him an automatic way to an appointment as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
These are questions that the Lamb can no longer answer.
After the escape from the campus, the police found Lamb's trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb himself killed a .38 Caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still on the way.
It wasn't immediately clear why lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she thought he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He promoted education in the spring.
One of the long-standing friends of Lambs described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamm was 20 when she met with friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to play her guitar for a few years.
He was the woman's fever at the time.
All the girls smelt there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss apparently had some time together.
In the emergency, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no warrant from a hero.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the backstein house, which is adjacent to a bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but had friends and had a daughter who was 19 years old now.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer year market three years ago.
Later, they played one or more gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for different companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night at night on September 5th for the last time after Lamb finished his guitar and oral harmony game before a special audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and messing with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar programme and specialized in American natives and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and the Student Committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people attended a Christmas celebration on Tuesday evening, including teachers, employees, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the mahnwache, while singing the "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The course will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We're trying to move our students back," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say Lamb made the emergency after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamb in his emergency Prentiss was named as his wife, but there is no indication that the two had ever been married.
Toys R Us plans to set less workers for the Christmas season
Toys R Us says that it won't set up as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the employees and seasonal workers who are currently employed by him a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to employ 40,000 people in shops and sales centres all over the country. In the Christmas season 2014, 45,000 workers were set up.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month it will start with application talks and the number of employees will rise from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is closer, and companies are preparing to set up time workers to provide stores with employees who sell, send and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was professionally a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We're sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it's always clear to me that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary film "Back in Time".
The film begins, and it makes sense to me that I'm a simulated genius and an arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentary on "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and the producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had premieres 30 years ago.
"It really is for me," said Spielberg, "unquestionably the biggest time travel film ever turned."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and in selected movies in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia's enhanced military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of the nearly five years lasting conflict, and more weapons will only become worse for the violence and misery of millions of people.
The UN Chief once again calls on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to cooperate and support integrated negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - on the edge of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the explosions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional authorities "make this situation unresolved."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in the crisis management in Syria that they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 Surveyes that show that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others have made him a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the top ranks in surveys down, it hasn't (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump leading in the two-digit area, and some start to seriously wonder what it means to nominate the real estate mogul.
Of course it's too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at this time Rick Perry's leadership was given to the rising Herman Cain, from which no one won only one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he should have fought in a general election.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's assets and start to let their dollars flow to crush him.
Here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity values have turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey of the Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Six of 10 Republicans now have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are held in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of the Republicans had a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a survey of CNN/ORC last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said they would be either "be pleased" or "be pleased" if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "suffered" if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "spirited" vs. 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
The next in matters of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican voters say that they would be "unsatisfied" or "angry" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticised for his bombing and poignant statements, 52 percent of Irish voters tending to the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temper for a president, says ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the nation's first pre-election state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of the Republicans think that he has the personality for a commander, says Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to perform his office effectively, and almost six out of 10 independent say that his temper does not fit into the White House, as ABC/Post says.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they set up their training huts, Republican voters keep Trump real.
If they are asked who wins the GOP nomination first, they say four out of ten last week's CNN/ORC survey said Trump was the best bet.
That's a change since the time they put their money on Jeb Bush four of the ten end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters in the past did not have the clearest crystal ball.
At that time, in the last cycle, four of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination against only 28% for the final candidates in the middle of Romney.
However, it turns out that a number of GOP voters view Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while the anti-trump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey at Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-on-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump collects the majority support.
He has 13 points in front of Carly Fiorina, 14 points in front of Marco Rubio, 15 points in front of Walker, 19 points in front of Jeb Bush and 33 points in front of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-on-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beat him?
Ben Carson would take over the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-on-head race.
A few majority of Donald-Trump fans say they've formed their opinion.
A new survey of CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that just over half of the voters who support the Trump say they have given their votes firmly.
Of course a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never change the opinion.
46 percent said they let the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition at the time of the other external pages, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as often for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violent" in his election campaign two months ago, immigration was a turning point and a turning point in the public discourse in 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombastic expression of Trump will keep Hispano-Americans from the Republican Party and damage the re-orientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
As long as immigration remains in the ramp light, Donald Trump will seem to do it too.
The frustration over the government climbs to new heights.
In the meantime, Donald Trump and Ben Carson are disappearing around half of the support of Republican voters, especially through their foreign status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday survey of ABC/Post, they prefer to be a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three of four Iowa Republicans were frustrated over the Republicans at the Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "Hellishly angry".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residents of Germany
Here in Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential facility - overlooking the North Sea Watt.
In the street, a square meter of a riding roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the offer of objects is naturally limited," says the study - therefore, the high price.
A new study shows which special levels cost most a square metre.
Of course, 18,70 Euros per square meter for a student offer in Munich are not really small.
Unlike Germany's top roads, however, one of the prizes is like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Angel & Völkers has published a ranking list of the most exclusive German residences - with square meter prices in floating heights.
There are once several tens of thousands of euros of nothing - per square meter, well marked.
But, well, who can afford it...
By the way, Munich is not at the top of the summit.
Champions League: Bavarian Dream Start thanks to Müller and Götze
Double Torschütze in Piraeus: Bayer-Star Thomas Müller just has a run.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for the FC Bayern to a deserving 3:0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then lived.
A sovereign performance of the Champions League season.
World champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have protected the FC Bayern in the Hexenkesel of Piraeus a dream start in the "Mission Milan".
The team of Trainer Pep Guardiola won her performance at the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a warm atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52/90.+2) and Götzes hit (89.) earned with 3:0 (0:0).
The 12th opening success in the series will be the first step towards finals on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to get to Munich in the third run.
Müller received good support from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto at his 28th encounter at the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership, who had a flagship shot by the world champion.
"We won't underestimate them," said Bayern-Captain Philipp Lahm in front of the game at Karayakis Stadium in front of 3.1,88 hot-flowered fans - and the Munich kept the word.
They showed a concentrated and committed imagination without glancing.
Piraeus had won his last six home games in the royal class, including against famous clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund was also found (1:3).
But the Bavarians, in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They courageously went to work, but in their offensive efforts they often went to work in vain.
The attacks were too often initiated by the game movement on the left-hand side of Douglas Costa, who rarely survived against the former Brownsweg Omar Elabdellaui.
Müller had more luck from the right than his flange from the right half-field entered the upper left toreck.
In the 67th minute the world champion gave the possible 2:0.
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiako's storm Ideye Brown hit the Polish headball off the line (26th).
Then, by direct removal, Torwart Roberto paired with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians used to raise her dominant game, Piraeus could put up needle sticks.
At Torhütter Manuel Neuer, however, there was a legacy.
For example, when he shot an Ideye gun over the latte (56).
Before New, Guardiola had a four-stringed band with David Alabama in the center next to Jerome Boateng, who did it well.
Mario Götze, after muscle problems back in the camp, first sat outside.
The WM helmet has only given green light after the final training, sports chief Matthias Summer said at "Sky": "Whoever wants to do something else about it is already evil."
In the first change, Guardiola also decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the wounded Lewandowski (59).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, per elfmeter put another müller on.
Before the game, it was at the stadium to crawl.
After a smaller group of partially suspected Bavarian fans in their audience block apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and marched with strikes against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bavarian fan was injured from the stadium.
Whoever smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth
Whoever smokes does not only damage the lung, but also the teeth - this puts a Potsdamer long-term study close.
The good news: If you refuse, the risk is reduced quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is reflected in the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research (DifE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers risked losing their teeth in advance to increase the 2.5- to 3.6-fold.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth decay are caries and inflammations of the tooth flesh, the DifE emphasizes.
For these parodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors stress.
The relationship between smoking and tooth loss therefore goes back to more frequent dental inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear how much smoking also increases the risk to careers.
People who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, however, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years to reduce the risk to the level of non-smokers, first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham explained.
Heiner Boeing of the DifE said: "Smoking shortens life."
Not smoking is good for lungs and appliances and also leads to good dental health until high age.
In Germany, more than 20 per cent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of toothlessness were affected, the DifE reported.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early dental failure.
The new long-term study undermines the findings.
Archaeologists rely on Cologne Rheinifer on remains from late antiques
Again and again, archaeological finds have been made at the right Rheinifer in Cologne.
Close to the building site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-German-Museum Skelette and the rest of historical buildings have dug out, said Museum Manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work at the Rhine, historians have been searching for so-called soil paints.
At all construction projects in the town district of Cologne, the museum is always raised as a specialist for archaeological ground-based care.
In the third section of the Rheinboulevard, the archaeologists have now been found.
It was already known from text documents that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood, Trier explained.
Besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 tombs was discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman of goods
After a young woman at the railway station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern was disappointed, the Federal police asked the people for help.
On the morning of the morning at 1.40 p.m., the woman from the direction of the railway station building crossed the track at the end of the train station and was recorded by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
According to the Federal Police, the recording of the train caused serious injuries.
She was treated notaristically on site and was taken to a hospital by rescue forces.
There is no evidence about the reason for the overnight crossing of the track of the young woman.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses, or residents have perceived acoustic perceptions.
Inquiries come from residents or passengers of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Information given about the cause of the accident can be given by telephone 0800/6888000 or by any other police station during the clock and free hotline of the Federal Police.
EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute with TTIP
To strengthen the dispute over the planned transatlantic Free Trade Agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The contested private divorce institutions for disputes between groups and states are therefore to be resolved by a more transparent system, which in its functioning clearly corresponds to more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that the citizens trust," EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said in his presentation.
Sweden intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the United States.
The German government announced support.
Through TTIP, the world's largest free trade zone is expected to produce 800 million people.
The plans for reforming the current arbitration procedures provide for the EU and the United States to elect jointly independent judges for a new investment court.
They are intended to come from the EU, the USA and third countries.
For the first time, a second instance is also envisaged.
It would allow it to raise objections to judgments.
To date, the parties agreed on arbitration, and there was no opposition against their rulings.
In the discussion last month, it became clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in matters of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, it intends to work on an International Investment Court according to its own data.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could also be resolved.
The investor-State split procedures (ISDS) required by large groups are considered to be one of the main reasons for Europe's major resistance to TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel litigation, against which companies are liable to cause injury to taxpayers, to impose national laws or to impose a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact referred to the EU Commission's proposals as insufficient.
It was particularly criticised that they should not apply to the free trade agreement already negotiated with Canada (Ceta).
The German Secretary of State Matthias Machnig (SPD) referred to the plans as major progress.
The Commission takes into account the essential points of the reform drawn up by the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private divorce courts is from the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European Business Europe Association warned against limiting the appeal opportunities of the economy by too many new rules.
Especially small and medium-sized enterprises could be adversely affected by this, it said.
When discussions on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) could be concluded, it remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been taking place since mid-2013.
However, the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States.
Originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year.
This date shall be deemed to be no longer sustainable.
Delicate People of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Seventeen years ago, Sufjan Stevens is on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now: Luxor).
Next to him is a flip-chart on which the fearsome folk singer recorded the picturesque state of Michigan with film pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost seized by Steven's speech.
He tells from different places that he always sign on the map, about which he reports his minor and carefully arranged songs.
Where they were created and what it looks like in his home.
Since then, Stevens has proved to be a wonderful creative error.
With the release of 2003 and the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", smartly composed songs that are very harmoniously close to the American people of the late 1960s, but at any time can be very opulent.
The rumor is that "Michigan" would be the first part of a series to be quoted: each of the 50 US states is to be awarded as a result.
However, in 2004 and near Rhine has already appeared "Seven Swans" and has positive expectations.
Reduced, Stevens comes up here.
Live enough for him guitar and Banjo.
A year later, the musician who lives in New York returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invitations You To: Come on Feel The Illinoisis"), 2005 is a highly celebrated masterpiece.
Overriding in ideas and stylistic fines.
The album rises to the American Billboard Charts and is not missing in any year's best list of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic replacements.
This sixth regular studio album is still widely orchestrated, but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and halls.
At the length of the smaller clubs, the stage shows will be presented here as a colourful spectacle of neon strips and large fluorescent staged cobblestones.
Currently, Sufjan Stevens is part of a five-headed band through Germany.
In the dark kept Hamburger More!
He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although almost 2,000 guests are now confined in their chairs, the clearly mature Stevens returns to intimacy and to the people.
Without giving a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience you hear: the talk is "opulenter" and this allows you to throw away the plates in principle.
Only to an addition thanks to Steven's modestness, acoustically plays a few older songs and finally turns down under a thousand applause.
Jeremy Corby's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn Debüt has been looking forward to the Prime Minister's question.
The new Labour President, Jeremy Corbyn, will give his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and will first place himself with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will be raised to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, with his performance being probably verified by the media and the Labour Members from nearby.
He called for "less theaters and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corby's leadership, since it will be appointed as a member of the shadow cabinet after his appointment and after his speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour President to hold a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence on Tuesday during the singing of the National Hymne, to challenge criticism of a number of Tory MPs, and is at the centre of several headline stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corby's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention to itself.
A speaker from Mr. Corbyn said he would have "stand in respectless silence" and recognized the "heldendom of the Royal Air Force in the Air Battle around England".
But a member of Mr. Corby's Shadow Cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Nights Program that he had advised the Labour Chairman to sing the national hymns "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Corby's team, and they relied on differences in economics, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as a leader.
The BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stumbled" within Labour, and according to Mr Corby's comments on the position of the European Union and the restriction on profits.
Mr Corbyn said the TUC conference that Labour has made changes to remove the whole idea of a total restriction.
Hours later, Mr. Smith told the shadow workers and pension ministers that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government's plans to reduce the limit of £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour President, David Cameron, since he is the head of Tory, is facing the dyspatch box in Parliament in the last decade.
The Labour President, who has promised another policy approach, says he has "Crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Icelandic North MP has said that the Prime Minister's questions are too confrontational, and that he will be left with both "fighting" and fighting counter-hackles, and that he has taken instead to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow minister of the economy, would represent him if he did not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is on his way abroad.
He also discussed the idea that other colleagues occasionally took the word, and that he spoke to John Bercow, the speaker in the basement, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to get away from politics in the style of a "kasperle theater", which is often associated with the Prime Minister's question hour. But a few years later, he admitted that he had refused to do so.
Since she was first broadcast on television in 1990, the question hour with the Prime Minister was considered the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the under-house and his position among his fellow Members, although critics argued that she had become a cartoon and needed extensive reforms.
'Gessossen in Joburg': homeless young people trained to photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a bustling place when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and thus earn their livelihood.
"I what shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take pictures from their surroundings and earn a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
In parallel, FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, the result without bonus in the United Kingdom increased by 2.9 % over the same period of the previous year.
Since 2009, this percentage has been the fastest and was estimated at the time of a rise in interest.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and was climbed up to 0.84% against the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index was increased by 1,49 % to 6,229,21.
SABMiller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a 20 % jump after taking over the rival AB InBev offer.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Buddhists, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the Competition Group for luxury goods.
Richemont's latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales to China - a key market for Burberry - again reported growth.
Glencore's shares increased by 5% after the mining said that he had taken $2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the Mondi packaging and paper group were the biggest losses on the index, with a decrease of 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs had put his estimate on "sales" for the company.
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports clothing company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The leader of JD Sports says that higher wages risked expansion.
JD Sports Manager Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labour costs of his company, he says.
The costs could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and this could mean that there are less additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber-Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
21-year-old kid, a hanger with over-scattered hair.
The type with the platinum white hair is 100 million euros hard.
Even more.
Now Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is going through.
Like Victoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
Since 7:00 in the morning, however, the Polin has been sitting on the cold stone plate in front of the Berlin luxury hotel at the Potsdamer Square.
The Bieber-Build: Here you live an idol whose poster has been hanging up in Stettin since Monday night.
The suite where the Canadian singer lives costs just as much on the day as her mother Ewa earns in half a year.
If not at all.
She says, "In fact, my Victoria had to sit in the tenth grade in high school."
"I will fill her with a dream."
Compulsory?
Who's kidding?
The fans don't.
Not even Bieber himself.
He's got it anyway.
For advertising in the Superbowls advertising break, he cashed three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pixel firm, many, many dollars on the beer account.
And with every doll that looks like he and the shopkeeper, beeber also throws off.
If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you stay on the window disc.
More than 100 million would have been worth it.
Some say the hippie went too far.
Others point out, Bieber was finally in the United States and the United Kingdom with his new single "What do you mean?" on place 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, the many zeros are not interested for the first time.
At least he does.
Pegida Plakat brings Lebaneses to potatoes
Potatoes or songs?
It is both - and it is in the potato cane developed by the oldenburg imbessier Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the phrase "Cartofefel instead of Doner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay Cartofel and meat have stuck together on a spear.
On the idea, he brought him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the title "Cartoffels instead of Donner", which he had accidentally seen on TV.
Since then, in his shop there is a barbecue that is filled with meat and potatoes.
"That's multiculture for the stomach," Alhay says.
The idea has now been introduced by the Lebanese at the Patent Office in Munich.
According to the Authority, it has been protected there since recently as a pattern of use.
So how much meat and how much potatoes the spirit contains, Alhay doesn't want to betray.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
Also with its customers, the culinary understanding of the peoples is good.
Metcash launches ground resistance campaign to fight Aldi-Infliction
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a soil resistance campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing for the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media, as well as through events like Adelaide Show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as icemaker Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples in IGA shops and shop owners, and sell authorized tickets to faithful customers for the South Australian Football.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when the wholesaler carries out his annual investor strategy day.
It is very much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA charging business and generate higher profit margins than Metcash IGA network in the Eastern States.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notorically provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the East.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will be removed about five percent of the food market in these two countries 12 months after the opening of its first market and all existing players, but mainly self-employed retailers, will be removed.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers would lose $360 million revenue per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and produce a sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in food and food business and in the amounts on Metcash high fixed-cost basis could cost Metcash about 13 million dollars in advance of interest and taxes, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the eastern states, mainly in Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most reliable.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's turnover in the food and food business will fall by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, and the market share of 14% in 2015 will fall to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglas, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told in a business in Melbourne that Metcash was likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond to Mr. Douglas' comments publicly.
But it is assumed that a board member of Metcash has made contact with Mr Douglas last week.
IGA's market share has decreased from 18 percent since 2010 to 14 percent, and revenues from Metcash's food and food trade, which has provided some 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction at the same time on sales and margins.
The wholesaler, however, resists and invests more than $150 million to compare sales prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh foods and to provide a better choice of private label foods.
Metcash's CEO, Ian Morrice, says that the price adjustments and charging processes will be applied to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of the Australian tennis club Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his conduct.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "Collateral Damages" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgyos and, in the opinion of the president of the Australian tennis club Steve Healy deserves more praise than criticism of his own behaviour.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, which is repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks", is driven by the announced confrontation of Kyrgyz with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters in the ramplight.
In a fiery skill game in Cincinnati shortly thereafter, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, stating Harrison: "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgyos, and I should have beaten the child."
While he was last seen defeating a tennis player after a crash defeated a potential U.S. open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis of Healy was constantly defended.
The teen is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth in the second place behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis-Cup-Alb final against the UK.
"One thing that I think I'm quite familiar with is the fact that, in my view, Thanasi was a little involved in the dispute," Healy said.
He broke a battle when he lost in the U.S. open due to a crash, but he is not the first player who broke a battle out of frost with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US openings, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too tight.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the dressing area, he's trained hard, he's good in shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important pre-decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra to return as a long-term fixed component to the team."
"First, we wish that the team is fully focused on competition and not on all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I believe that Nick has succeeded very quickly in the rise, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his action. Some time outside of the ramp light, where he can only think about it, I think it is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary states an emergency, closes the border, keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the situation and closed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and determined all those who tried to illegally enter the country. All with the aim of stopping the flow of migrants.
Chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a non-Serb country and Serbian officials responded with encouragement.
The people who had fled for violence stood in an unknown distance on the street between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and lay down there for an unknown time.
But frustrations increased.
When a police raider swam over them, the migrants "Opens the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian emergency police.
Some show up from protest food and water back.
Serbia's Foreign Minister stated that it was "inadmissible", that migrants would be sent back from Hungary, while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
Talks with Brussels and other countries need to be held in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turbulence at the Hungarian-Serbian border was not able to agree on a common immigration policy one day after the 28-nation bloc at a meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed their hope that an agreement would be reached by the end of the year, either next month or by the end of the year, that the EU countries would take up another 120,000 refugees, including some of them from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis in the continent.
However, Hungary did not place its hopes on a swift action by Brussels or its neighbours.
On Tuesday, the emergency in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis so that they could shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country also plans to build a steel mill along its border to Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country - after it had finished a mill on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisons were used in the race to create the Stacheldrat-Zaun between Hungary and Serbia.
In the last few months, Hungary has become a major hub for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and an entry point for the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life, and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - an opinion that is strongly opposed to other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4-metre (13 feet) high fence, which the government had built along the southern border to Serbia a crime. These laws also impose higher prison sentences for convicted human dealers.
"Because of the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the state of the emergency," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say very clearly: Illicit cross-border is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree to the military's use, which is expected for next week, but reports from Associated Press have seen heavy-armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for a long time.
Gyorgy Bakondi, State Security Adviser for Orban, said that 45 authorities had already entered the country deeper when trying to cross the border.
They come over by damaging the zoo, they are now in police custody, and they are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are about to repair the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia after a train wagon with a stacked wire to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of people and pressured a crowd to enter it.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clinton's lead in front of Bernie Sanders in national survey
Former U.S. Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to have a two-digit lead in the democratic race to nominate at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins against her on the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the elections (58 percent before), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for the presidency, receives 15 per cent of the democratic voters of the elections.
More than five months before the elections begin, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more stable in their choice than the other candidates.
Since the CBS-News survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has gained some gains.
Clinton has a great advantage in women and moderates, but these advantages have decreased.
Your support for men is clearly reduced, and Sanders is back here with only 5 points.
Clinton's advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has fled, and they and Sanders are now at the same height.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage in the older voters.
Last month Clinton was in front of Sanders with two-digit lead in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.
About half of the democratic voters of the national elections say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if it was nominated by the party.
A quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support them.
Maybe it's not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are particularly excited about her.
The views are more mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support her with enthusiasm.
While 48 percent of the democratic voters of the election say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to dealing with the problems and the desirability is also cited.
Since the Vice-President throws a potential for the presidency into the Waagscale, 57 percent of the democratic voters of the elections want to see him running - although a third believes he should not.
If democratic voters of the elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
Clinton's followers say more than half that Biden's second choice would be far from Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's preference for Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him running.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win the election; however, this figure has decreased by 78 percent in the last month.
Biden is a second at this measurement at a distance, but the percentage that sees him as the "selectivest" has increased.
Nevertheless, when it comes to the question of what is more important for a candidate, democratic voters call questions about the eligibility.
Like in the last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate for these electors of the elections is ineligible.
The democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some important features in voters of their party's choice.
Most people view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is best cut off in honesty with the three candidates, while Clinton's strength is the leadership.
Thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not agree with him.
Democratic voters of the elections generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server are still being asked as a foreign minister during the time of office, most democratic voters of the elections are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it has not affected their views as a whole.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion on this was split in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no effect on their general opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent said that their opinion had worsened.
They are mostly Republicans, more than six out of ten who say their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered to be honest and confidential by the voters of its party, this is still a problem for them among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent view them as honest and confidential, 8 percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May.
62% of the electors do not consider them to be honest and confidential.
At the same time, 55 percent of the voters across the country also view Trump as not honest and not confidential.
However, Clinton and Trump receive good grades in leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush cut off the best in honesty.
A majority sees Sanders more than honest, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic voters in the elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson goes back to Donald Trump for a national survey.
Ben Carson is in the latest survey of CBS News/New York Times close behind Donald Trump
The two candidates now lose half of the voter support in the new survey, and others lose dramatically.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers throughout the country. Support is growing by 23% in the last CBS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson dropped from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson is welcome in demographic groups and exceeds Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, was defeated with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who is the lowest in the field, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are 6% in third place.
The error margin for the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was performed in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey, published last week, shows that Carson is increasing in the survey - he is getting 19% support from the Republicans, behind the Trump with 32% support.
The latest survey of ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly in front of Carson.
With a view to a carson rising last week, Trump found some side points for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for asking Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Satisfied bath temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees hot.
Even if peaks are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for those who have to take a bath to find hot water.
A bath in the North Sea or East Sea should be a shorter pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some no longer go to the sea: Maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and East Sea this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) shares.
On the other hand, bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east it is even up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees.
Five members of the brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch College-Neuling
Almost two years after a student died during a shaky ritual in a student association in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, a murder case against five people is filed.
Members of the New Yorker Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introduction ritual in September 2013 brutally and delayed his transportation to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police informed him.
Officials said that he was loaded with eyes connected with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and was repeatedly attacked while he was trying to go over a frozen field to a goal.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, and then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood did not call the 911 emergency number after Deng became powerless and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, so the police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, put on his symptoms, and and Andy Meng to contact the national presidents of the brotherhood to get advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide tools and put the welfare of the brotherhood in principle over that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be rebuffed, and he died the next morning in his injuries.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added with strong force injuries to the head, body, and neck.
"To many families, the Shikans of the brotherhood have been destroyed. At least one student has died to the Schikanes since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Dengs family, in a statement.
Brothers and their members must be taken into account, and this step by the authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a third degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, are also accused of shaky attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
"We want not only to make the parties responsible, but if there is an organization that - officially or informally - has sanctioned this, we will also take these into account," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has revoked its membership of the local group.
This will happen when the feed increases the interest
A rise in interest is coming, and the house will get into the fence, income will rise for loans, and the economy will rise to a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it all takes and how long it will last.
In particular, the history of the economy provides only a small guide to the end.
A recession occurred within 11 months of the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, even if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial facilities react.
Therefore, representatives of the US central bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when they start to increase interest rates, but rather on the time needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants could find that the whole excitement may have been exacerbated by an increase in interest rates.
"The first increase in feed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of "billion money," said Julian Jessop, a chief economist at Capital Economics, in a message to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal heights, but still to a low level to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no effect.
Here is a historical trend based on how some areas of the economy could respond:
As the market has seen in the last month, the advance of interest increases can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for assets to be rejected 12-24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy again," said Deutsche-Bank analysts in a new study to what happens after interest increases in the fed.
More precisely, in the past 35 years, the market is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the increase in interest, rather flat in the 250 days after (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average yield in the past six cycles of 14.4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob Doll, Chief Plant Strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
The Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the income begins to decrease.
Reactions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is of utmost importance that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at an increase in Fed's interest.
According to Deutsche Bank, at 118 interest rates, the nominal GDP was below 4.5 per cent since 1950.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, few expect this to take place and expect only 1.5 per cent for the third quarter according to Atlanta Fed.
Interest increases in such a fragile economic environment could be risky and raise the question, "Is it different this time," said the Deutsche Bank.
Market participants focused all year round on an increase in feed interest, and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many street and economics believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting, the future trade is only a 25% probability.
"In our study, all the increase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super-cycle with increasing pressure on GDP and pre-recession heights very quickly after the start of recovery," said the report.
In contrast, this is a clear slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is at a distance of the longest that the feed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are up to 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market is expected to increase interest, and the pattern is quite similar as on the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares when they change their strategic course.
In the case of loans, the yield appears to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the borrowers fell immediately, the Deutsche Bank said.
The strata of Charles Schwab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer collection of income between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a collapse of the curve.
High-level loans often produce better returns in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher returns," said Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the view of stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the yield curve is smoother, credit rates have expanded and volatility has increased - all features of the market when the feed increases its strategy.
In large and large companies that develop most of their business in the United States will benefit from increasing interest rates and making local products more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and the financing of their debt.
"History shows that "quality" shares tend to react positively three months after an initial increase in interest," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a customer report.
Firms with a strong balance sheet have on average exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility on their shares also exceeded their pendants with low quality by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debts are going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most, said Goldman.
Out of the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savings could see gains through higher earnings, even if experts of different opinions are how fast this will take place.

BBC Radio 3 "turns" to Classic FM, claims to be a leading member of parliament and increases new pressure on the sender to prove that he is doing something that the private broadcasters do not do.
Conservative Deputy Andrew Bingham also told the BBC boss that the public-law radio broadcast "crazy" and increasingly no longer be different from his commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 doesn't seem - I don't like to use the word "dumping" - but it seems to turn into a classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, appear to be only under another name.
So if you're trying to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples, in which you're actually just imitating what's already on the market," said Mr Bingham.
The BBC Director-General pointed out the props and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public disclosure.
What I learn from Radio 3 will teach me about classical music nowhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unsurpassed.
"And finding the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and to commission new works, I also really care about it," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that it had to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was, however, not the only element of BBC production which, during the hearing in the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, led to the introduction of commercial rivals to the feet.
The Tory Lieutenant Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was purchased by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated costs of £22 million.
Do you see why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly noticeable?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1-show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced "on a special BBC basis".
He added, he hopes that the company will find "a hit from our own home stable" when it next starts a series of entertainment.
However, he refused to exclude the order of other series of The Voice in the future or to issue the fees for other forms of entertainment.
Internet rates rose in August at the slowest and the Black Friday may be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the start of the recordings in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using phones for sale
Experts believe that the Black Friday has stopped spending in November
For over a decade, virtual shopping has been booming, and many of Britain’s main shopping streets have become ghost cities.
However, experts say that there is now evidence that online conversions stagnate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of the recordings in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there is evidence that online sales stagnate after new numbers show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back by 2000, then this has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, publisher of the IMRG Sales Index to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started to shop with their phones.
It meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now this is happening, and we may experience that growth is decreasing.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the remaining sales.
Experts believe buyers keep their purchases before this event, which takes place each Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers was cut off to make their computers, and some dealers' websites collapsed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, in which buyers fought for shorts, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study of the British Retail Consortium found that a little more than £5 expenditure was spent online.
In some products such as TV and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of the people buy clothing and shoes online instead of in the motels in the inner cities.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca during the Kran accident - Bin Laden's family is being punished
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca by the streets
Saudi Arabia partially launches the collapse of the huge Saudi bin-load group
The Ministry of Health said that in addition, 394 people were injured after the crash
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane broke down on Mecca's grand mosque.
Regrettably, largely dressed in white, the route to pay their respects when the first of the dead entered their last trip to the Al-Moaisem Friedhoff.
The mourner process took over at the Holy Place, where only days before a building through the cover of the mosque and then fell on the bees.
The bodies were released for burial when the Saudi king imposed a penalty on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 better killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Great Manchester, father of four children who were on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Haddsch in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already firmly promised that the Haddsch will move to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said that the bin-load group should not have left the arm of the crane until it was used.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said that the bin-load group was responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the company's leadership was prohibited from travel abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crash of the crane, which collapsed in an inner courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before Haddsch, which later took place in this month.
The Bin-Laden Group did not issue statements on the collapse of the cranes and their representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also divided the group because of non-current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Hundreds of cranes surrounded by Mecca Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the bin-load group.
For decades, the Bin Laden family has been associated with the family of Saudi Arabia and has been undertaking larger construction projects.
The dead leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a distraught son, who was rejected by the family in the 1990s.
The collapse of the crane came in the middle of strong winds and rains, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said that 158 people are staying in the hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rials (£ 174,000) be paid to the relatives of the victims and the same amount of permanent injuries.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says the time of the cheap Eastern European artisans is over
Britain increasingly employs handicrafts, says Veronica Laury
The number of skilled artisans from Eastern Europe has increased behind
This leads to the opening of 200 additional Screwfix loads aimed at handicrafts
At the same time, Kingfisher 60 B&Q sales outlets will close the countrywide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britain lowers its barriers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled Eastern European artisans who carry out the work at home
If you can walk around with a hammer or a brush to stretch the walls, you seem to belong to a minority today.
Because Britain is increasingly employing handicrafts to carry out domestic jobs in their homes, the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the construction market chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled artisans from Eastern Europe who currently offer low-priced services was overrun.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops, which are directed to handicrafts and close 60 sales sites of B&Q.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight of ten purchase decisions in the shop are made by women.
At the moment, the men are superior to the employees.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that are taking more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, "There's still a majority of men working in our branches.
We need to shift this to a greater balance.
In principle, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of items by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laury, who is one of only five women leading company at the top of a British FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial management.
Mrs. Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decrease in half-yearly earnings and sales after the group had hidden the costs of closing the stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, the Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Functionaries of Aich/Dob because of mistrust in court
At the Landesgericht Klagenfurt, on Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vizemeister Aich/Dob have to be responsible for their mistrust and fees.
The accused are not guilty.
One of them was also accused of abuse of office.
From this proposal he was legally acquitted in May.
The current process has been lost.
According to state attorney Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, the defendants had been crystallised that in the years 2006 to 2011 they had used funds from associations that they could have made available in their functions for private purposes.
The damage is about 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also accused of financial misconduct.
This fact was distinguished by the president of the creation board, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It should be negotiated at a later date.
For the rejection of the mistrust, the defense stated that at no time did the association create an asset.
The sports officers had only calculated the expense damage and the sports club for which they were active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they invested a lot of time and money out of debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 shillings in 2001 (EUR 44,000).
"At that time we were facing the situation: Shall we lead the club further or shall we stop?" said one of the defendants, in the brothel Big Business Examiner of the Finance Office.
With his colleague and co-rapporteur, he then decided to take over this task.
With all the risks.
"We have set up money, put our life insurance as security at the bank," he said when he agreed.
The association has been agreed: you can manage the money freely; it must not be done.
In addition, it has been decided - in the case of financial matters - that the payment of the damage caused by the expenditure has been effective until 1991.
Therefore, part of the damage caused was paid only a year later, from 2003, when a plus was on the account.
Therefore, neither pauscal nor detail appearing, the former Obmann explained the proceedings.
The accounts and savings books managed the two accused together, the second accused said.
Why the payments were not disclosed to the association in detail, the judge asked.
The association has not been interested in the details of the financial situation; it is important that it was only the freedom of the debt, as the answer is.
When an official investigation for abuse of office began in 2011, an amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the association account.
The defendants explained that these were the six withdrawals.
This paper account was on behalf of the second accused and was not known to the association according to its statement.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The questionnaire did not know the answer for a long time.
Then he finally thought he believed this was the best for the association.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything about this money, the attorney put it in the room.
The co-rapporteur was informed, the officer justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "damaged recovery".
Why did you want to know about damage?, the judge and the state attorney.
The first defendant stated that he had not agreed with this wording because the association had never been damaged.
But what should I do when the lawyer says, "With that, you're all out of the knife."
"Am I a lawyer?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said that he had never paid a cent worth, he calculated only kilometer money and diets.
On diets, he took 1,000 euros a month into account, but he added that the actual effort was much higher.
The defendants were unable to produce precise documents for the previous years.
These were no longer stored after an operational examination in which everything was assessed as correct, they explained.
Kilometer money had also been involved in the second defendant.
All the repairs were in the bar, and he had to go from his place of residence to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main debate will continue on 23 September with the examination of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard covers another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the three years of staff reduction, the computer crisis will reduce further jobs during the company's division.
The U.S. computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) has no end.
As part of its restructuring, the US technology group plans to reduce the number of 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its customer share.
As a result, costs of $2.7 billion (EUR 2.4 billion) were to be saved, the company informed on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special load of about 2.7 billion dollars, which will fall from the fourth quarter.
The three-year reduction of 55,000 jobs has not yet been completed.
At the end of the financial year 2013/14, HP employed about 302,000 employees.
After all, the Hewlett-Packard shares accounted for 2.3 percent.
The California Palo Alto Group, which has become a major company with printers, currently split up: This is how the computer and printer business is to be merged into a new society today - separate from the more challenging areas of computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services.
Both business parts are to be listed in the stock exchange.
A once again disappointing PC charge and a weaker demand for company customers for its services recently put the world's second-largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo.
In the third business quarter to the end of July, the paragraph of PC and printers dropped by 11.5 percent.
The turnover fell by 8 percent to almost $25.4 billion.
This led to the return of the ransom in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a split and massive job cuts on the change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has only recently reacted to the fact that customers increase smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more and more business online at the same time.
Whitman's restructuring plans foresee the total reduction of around 55,000 seats.
Conflicts: Most support the anti-IS training mission
However, a direct involvement of German soldiers in Iraq's fights would be largely rejected: 54% spoke against, 35% agreed.
The fact that other states are flying against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61% positive.
24% are in conflict.
A collaboration with the Syrian ruler Baschar al-Assad denied 51 per cent of the respondents, 20 per cent for that.
29% could not decide.

Röszke: violence against the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have deployed on the Serbian border at Röszke Tränengas and water towers against several hundred refugees.
Euronews correspondent Daniel Bozsik experienced violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported on the phone:
A group of refugees crossed the border.
After that, a police line had formed and behind the police stood a water heater.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, pieces and plastic bottles after the officers.
The officers first introduced uninterrupted pepperspray.
Then the police used Trengengas.
Many trengengas have been sprayed toward the refugees.
This led to the dissolution of the group.
The refugees have now withdrawn somewhat in anticipation.
A more pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the area.
Children who had taken in the train gas are screaming.
Other refugees fell together and were left under breath.
The Serbian police press also suffered injuries from the use of Trengengas and Pepperspray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US bank
The world is watching when the US notary bank meets in two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not the interest will be raised for the first time for almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists who were questioned by Reuters found that a little more than half the last week of the view was that the Fed would do this, now thinks that the Fed will last a little longer and that the interest rates will be maintained at the current rate of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historic event, because it's been seven years since the Fed interest was put on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Head of Staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is at a relatively good level of performance, billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a little inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy view of global conditions.
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances against such a step are good.
Decision to be notified at 8:00 p.m. on Thursday
Death shot at Delta State University left apologizing
After the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "suffering" him at the first murder and wanted to make it impossible," authorities announced on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, Professor of Geography and Social Science at Delta State University, reported the emergency number at 10:00 a.m. on Monday morning
And he said, "He shot someone and killed someone."
Lamb told the staff at the emergency station that the police had to send policemen to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" was in the house, but "no one will disturb", but he'll probably be upset.
The police asked the caller his name, but he didn't give it to him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When the police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, who said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to make it go away.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday evening, when the police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday, there was "no information, no evidence" for a "threefold relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said that they had been married for about seven years as a "good man".
The two were separated 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19, and she was "destructed on the ground".
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, which was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had met Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "Don't go to jail."
When the police picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car aside, ran away, walked into the woods and killed himself with a gun.
Lamb received a doctoral title from Delta State University in spring 2015, as his life course on the university website indicates.
Stars that lost their lucky bringer
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-term partner, Farrah Fawcett, because of cancer.
The actor also reportedly fought with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of possession of drugs.
I'm sure all this calls for his tributary.
Eurowings: Lufthansa built the group
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organisation.
150 of the world's 1000 leading forces will cost the group building the workplace.
With the pilot union, there are new negotiations.
Lufthansa builds up its business structure and evaluates the Eurowings ticket.
The aim of the re-establishment was a profit and loss contribution of around EUR 500 million per year from cost and recovery synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
For example, there is no board for the passenger business in the future at Lufthansa.
Eurowings is to be developed as independently as possible.
In the board team around Chef Carsten Spohr, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the future.
With the refurbishment, the track underlines the importance of Eurowings, which the Group wants to join with Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120,000 employees of a strong company has been complex.
The airlines signed under the roof of the Airline Passage Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the tariff conflict with the pilot association Cockpit (VC), the negotiations will be resumed on Thursday following the legally closed strike.
That's what the union shared.
The topic of the conversation is to be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to come "in a year with a forecasted record result" as quickly as possible with sustainable results.
The conflict between union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional provision of the pilots, the concept of "Wings" is the background.
It is anticipated that Lufthansa, in the fight against competitors, sets out routes to the Group's Eurowings Billiglinie.
Under the title "Morgenzug in the South", paintings by Leena Krüger are shown in the artist's house.

Luke Shaw from Manchester United can't play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw at the Champions League of Manchester at the PSV Eindhoven has a double fracture of his right leg.
While this brought the left foreign defender to the wine and will exclude him for at least six months from the game, Louis van Gaal does not hope that Shaw can play again in this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw was broken into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes in the field and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double bone fracture and is in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18, it's very hard and then plays fantastic, and then it happens.
In the dressing room he had an oxygen mask.
He's crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it takes six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to be a red card and the hanging of an elephant meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the judge of divorce, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian judge had moved.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an elephant meter and a red card were missing.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account said: "Thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how broken I am, my path to recovery begins now, I come back stronger."
Related to this: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw at the defeat of the PSV
With the European Championship in France, the British Defender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming of June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It's a very bad injury."
If a player with this type of injury leaves the room, all are very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent.
Moreno suffered a bone fracture when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the WM 2014.
"He's doing very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and then if you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," said Cocu.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction, so it looked like he [moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In the conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard something can be.
I feel really bad about it, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a game by Chris Smalling.
Are you sure David Cameron knows the Lorax better?
It's a thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won't take long until you know it almost externally.
Maybe you're David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister decided for The Lorax, the environmental facilitator of Dr. Seuss, published in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "sudden, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book that I like to read to my children, because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we've missed so far."
Everything is nice and good, except that the next paragraph, in which Cameron reportedly describes the action of the book, instead of repeating a content of the 2012 film version, added the new characters and details to extend the rather short original text.
"In the middle of the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a young man named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose true name Theodor Seuss Geisel was loud and died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if this wasn't suspicious enough: the text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and begins: "In the walled town of Thnead-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a product, a young man named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the book. Here is an unnamed boy, like the local environment through the silvery, fallen trees, THNEED strutting Once-ler despite the protests of the so-called Lorax, a horrendous, narrow-minded being, "who speaks in the name of the trees", is being devastated.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times each other.
A Downing Street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but did not give any further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
To hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you see the frame chosen by England for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test series is not on my map.
I wouldn't exclude an outside victory.
Alastair Cooks site may be less experienced than three years ago, but there are good spin players in the Batting show, and the community spirit is strong; they will not wear scars from 2012, only a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as spin-bowler and Adel Rashid, even if he is an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Here's a message: Adam Lyth separates from the England Test Framework and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is, of course, hard to analyze for me as his chief coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and this led to the nomination, because - and I have said this before - players are their own best voters.
Long ago, you would have extended the course of Lyth, but he had control over his own fate.
If he hopefully misses another course for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The English-Trainer Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he did not do so well, and that does not surprise me; he is primarily a team-man.
The question of how long a test slagman gets to put his signs is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and out.
The only suggestion that can be raised was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming in, and he's a hit man I appreciate very much.
He's an X-factor cricket player, what we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge spot, which hit us very hard.
He must have at least the same opportunities as he had before him, but this, of course, depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea to let Moeen beat next to Cook, which would bring an extra spin-bowler and get four quicks, turned up, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a hit man can't hit there, and this left hand has already shown that he's a hell of a cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for her, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He got three hundred runs right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the box as a back-up spinner, and in my limited treatment with him, he impressed me very much as a young man.
People may look at their statistics - on average 31 with the hitter and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there are no large number of backup spinners who raise their hands and the trainers have decided for young people.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made some clever additions to the training staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman of Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a lot of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and how Mahela has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the dressing room, even if the news is consistent with the previous words.
Collys teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One-Days, Root got a similar break against Australia and I don't have a problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and teammakers do not determine the timetable.
And you have to think that, like players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made by light hearts.
The Brexit warehouse (Brexit = UK exit from the EU) could win on Zulup if the economy goes into a flood until 2017
David Cameron's tireless renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is being made more difficult every day, even without the choice of brilliant Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn as the leader of Labour or the TUC, who is deeply ingrained because of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some Member States, as deep as the EU is now and not always because of their own debt, are set up by the UK itself with broken consents and disruptive treaty changes that they do not want most.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they are in danger of social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they win alliances for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants a British looking outside the UK inside the EU target - "Let's not be alone with France," says Berlin - and let's see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials have arrived in some major cities to the point where they don't care whether we stay or go.
German-owned Chancellor Angela Merkel has been an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office, before it looks bad for her, as it has happened with the exaggerated long-lasting ones such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande is looking at his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's also a bluffing force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will stretch out a leg to help the Selfie-British Brits, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's withdrawal from the UK - something they do not want, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, perhaps some such ministers are planning even deliberately not helpful remarks, in the SNP style, while Britain's 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"The renegotiation was a pleasure" and "British Britain has won nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how stolen Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU skeptics are the oligarchy of the press barone, how they were not supported by our entry in 1973 at the time of the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben.
You can remember Boris Johnson, the Erz-Euro opportunists, who made a name as an "EU-Gera-Banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
With all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of Tax-fearing Squirches, Telephone-Hacking Aliens and the Pseudo Non-Interns, who own most of our big newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similar about her, but realized that if you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla, you'll distribute better bananas to get rid of it, instead of becoming his dinner and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more blairian than Blair himself, when he opposed Cameron's referendum, because Blair had laid down the principle of the unadopted EU constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.
The press never did that to him either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needs time to waste on me - seems in danger to repeat Neil Kinnocks Boycott Murdoch's strategy of the 1980s, a mistake then and today.
It can take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I express it in a friendly way - in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional blue-colored trend and the wildest fields of Tory's Small Anglanderism may say yes.
It's what Hilary said "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on the radio and television this week when the pathfinder fought in him, not to mention that Corby's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow Chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father tried to be unfairly opposed to his Labour cabinet colleagues, without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to remain "under all circumstances" - Ben's expression - was not what McDonnell said, but what JC told his fellows and deputies after all the reports at her closing meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the moving bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he has even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the battle of social media, a crime scene of Paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to keep Labour's support in the referendum campaign for self-esteem, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins must think so.
But McDonnell and Corby's fundamental multidepartment on EU membership - in line with her Bennite siege economy, her anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of the esoteric debate among left-wing dissidents, for which the nazism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with its multiplicity to the Nato - Tom Watson is convinced by the fact that JC does not start a campaign to get out - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of home for their leaders.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital, - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if this can be meaningless?
The U.S. has already been quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even by reducing the costs of the Tory government in power, where I was reminded of something called the British Influence Security Forum at the beginning of Monday.
Experts criticise Public Health England report on e-cigarettes
According to researchers, claims by a State-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, partly with links to the tobacco industry.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "baseline report" last month and described it as a "extensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the burden of data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A headline in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extremely windy base" on which PHE founded its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers wrote in BMJ and asked whether the claims "to build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects that the claim by PHE that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people invited to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to bring their views on the damage of various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose manager was supposed to have received the British American Tobacco Media (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting stated that they would receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding that he should have received according to previous reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reasons for the selection of members of the board are not provided, but several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also indicate a sectoral funding in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting also took part in the tobacco management of PHE.
The research work of the group "is markedly", that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products at most criteria", wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, no such links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the claims of PHE that "there has been no evidence so far that e-cigarettes served as a way of smoking for children or non-smokers".
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had already been responded to.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies in his search.
All evidence indicates that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to this, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what it does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die of a smoking-related illness each year, and smoking costs the National Health System two billion £ per year.
Through the clear presentation of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastAnders, former head of Channel 4 says
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop sending programs like EastAnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit-shows like Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for placing public-law programs that are probably seen by a smaller audience in hard-disputed time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and from broadcasts such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to work more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to contact the BBC.
"I have had problems with the idea that BBC programmes are being commissioned or sent, which would also be clearly shown by unsubsidized rivals," Johnson told the Upper House Communications Committee as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the radio fee, which I don't think for the medium or long term for a good idea, you should at least have its production on programs that others don't do or order.
They send The Voice in a first-class window because they want to get as wide support as possible for their future.
The idea that anyone else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's, of course, nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax program is funded, which could also be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is a further, attributed to both own productions.
To be honest, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how this is supposed to be public-law television.
I don't think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, led channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was responsible for hunting for evaluations "because of the ambitions of the people working there and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts return to what the former director of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTagart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East Enders should be sold.
Johnson said that the rather public-law niche programs should "go to BBC4 where you can't measure the audience quite well, but they fulfill their tasks, and they can argue when they go on their seeming missions to justify 4 billion £ radio charges, "Now, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that nobody has seen."
They put them in a time window where no one would ever want to see them.
For the radio fee, Johnson said to the committee: "I ask you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value from this.
Of course you all think, we all think you get a big value here for £150 per year, but for people who are a lot of money for £150, ask me if that's right, because they don't consume much from the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5-Chief David Elstein, who also spoke before the committee on Tuesday, asked the BBC to check their Reithian mission "to inform, form and entertain".
He said that only a few of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% of their radio production - and they should take an example of this changing in "information, clarity and entertainment" at public-law television stations in Australia and Canada.
On the issue of partnerships Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said that only a handful of people are shown on TV and enter alliances with the commercial channels to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction at the moment they are hit with sound pulses.
Scientists have raised worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The small nematodes change the direction at the moment when they are exposed with sound pulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard.
The impulses work by activating motoreuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
Further on this topic: Researchers read and write hiernation with light
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new process, called Sonogenetics, when ultrasonics can be used to activate a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that provides an electrical impulse in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Fadenworms usually do not react to ultrasonic noise, but Chalasani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, strengthen the ultrasonic waves that then enter the worms.
The enhanced ultrasonic waves affect structures called TRP-4-ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves effect the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, such a report Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasonic-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4-ion channels.
When applied ultrasonic to the modified creatures, the sound waves are reinforced by the microbials and transferred to the worms where they include the modified motor neurons.
The process has some similarities with optogenetics, a cutting tool that allows the scientist to switch on and off neurons with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics might have some advantages over this technique.
In contrast to light, which must be sent to the desired place in the brain at an optical fiber, low frequency ultrasonic tissue may pass unimpeded and thus can be sent to the brain from above onto the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neurons susceptible to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

View Amnesty International Anti-Waffen fair video.
Terrible killer drones!
Leg joints tearing leg joints!
Streubomben!
And electroshocks that cause painful pain, but do not leave any trace!
The joyful voice and the cartoon images leave no doubt that this display for the world's largest weapons fair is a battle parody produced by Amnesty International to bring the British government's readiness to bring to light the ramps, weapons on repressive regimes over the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are visible at bus stops and in the subway trains and require a second look.
"Important announcement: Do you drive from September 15th to September 18th with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the fonts of London Underground and the marks of the DLR line, which turns into a panzer image.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will drive with the DLR ... customers will be asked to help at the stop of the gun fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have shown their work in the Museum for Gross Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped with the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6-£ package of in-bus keys, which claims that "access to around a third of the bus stop advertising areas on the planet."
Transport for London doesn't find this poster "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and Professor at the University of Essex, artists will be more critical and try to bring political works to the public outside galleries.
Many artists work with activists in protest movements and note that they have to go out into the real world to influence their art on society.
Another one of the anti-war trade spots welcomes the pendler in the U-Bahn.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times over 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the VCCP advertising agency, who works in a non-profit with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Liver was amazed at the silence that ruled around advertising for the gun fair - through an empty site of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic flexible company, but "through the incorporation with bright colors and animation it remains stronger."
"They've done a fantastic job helping us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is a step-by-step by the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not unlawfully dealt with in front of our house.
Perhaps the most creative art around the gun fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors make amazingly euphemistic products.
In a press release Saab reveals an order from the US army about "the AT4CS RS fired by the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped combat head that delivers outstanding effects within the target."
Whatever it does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Life in Student Housing
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgivator, I moved to a student home, still in the faith of Berets and Moral Relativism, but only now do I remember the excited smiles of those I've had - and the numerous, long-lasting complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The entrance to the student residence is quite scary from easy to extreme nervousness.
It's tempting to say: tell people where you come from, whether or not you've taken a Saturday year, where you're talking about Corbyn and why you say "Marmite doesn't love or hate because seriously, guys, it's just a HAHA Hefe extract, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest.
It links the conversation and helps you find out the people you like, in contrast to those you would not talk to, even if your firefighters were driving in fire and these fire extinguishers were.
Let people go.
People's rooms often turn into drinking receptions, movie-night venues and municipal meeting points, but they are also the places where people are attracted to and recuperated by their underwear.
To this end: Do not think about starting with a relationship at the Union
Introverted people receive severe treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many students' homes form a space-to-space cotton culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This may be the hell for someone who tries to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to go away to get back the energy I've spent on interacting with you."
Try to feel when a co-militone is exhausted from society - and send him an SMS instead.
Zoom in: Do it.
A guy in my student residence had the idea that a non-closed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship closes through bakery.
Since you start the Uni at the top of the Back Manie, the knock on the doors of people to introduce themselves with a plate full of brownies is less rare than the welcome of the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I have baked you something. So, and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions."
To offer homemade candy is a good way to make friends.
Your fellow citizens feel obliged to entertain themselves and may eventually associate your face with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you're a decent baker.
Bad mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you hit.
Stealing food is a common crime in student residences.
Of course, clauing chickens is a theft, but is taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check with the milk owner.
The chances are that they say to serve themselves even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your things, it's annoying, and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my companion, who added a drug to her milk to punish the thief.
She's in jail now.
You shouldn't make any noise, people stop sleeping or work.
It is not only to be a decent person, but to be among the people sitting in the glasshouse in the truest sense of the word.
A girl on my fleur asked her neighbors if it would allow them to put something quieter in Drum & Bass, for it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5: 00 p.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for two more hours before she let her own music cry, closed her door and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future marriage partner accidentally moved into the same student's home?
In return, would it not be extremely painful if you kept a companion for your future mate, ran into them, separated again, and then had to see them every day, and perhaps live myth, how they turn all their friends into themselves?
Of course, the heart goes its own ways - but if a warm companion is definitely not your future mate, at least try to give your surviving a little sense of purpose.
At the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his unclosed room, the border between a wolf and a mobbing is as fine as it seems.
A good string is funny, but it only takes moments until it gets to the boomerang.
By hiding, give a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but never waste any room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock her door, and place her keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but thank you no more than twice on the deck.
Series houses for refugees, self-employed, low-income workers
The real estate company Markus Gildner builds in the medium-sized corner houses for people who do not have much money.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the only raising mother and the minors."
"I show how you can still build cheap and well today," says 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will be forced into the apartment market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly to create cheap living space: he builds in a project series houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be forced into the apartment market.
What is your solution?
Markus Gildner: The massive accommodation in containers or tournaments has no sustainability.
Because people stay a big part here.
In view of the refugee flow, we also need sufficient living space in the next decades.
A completely banal, three-storey row house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house needs at least a place.
It facilitates integration.
It's different when you put people in living blocks.
Each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for each four asylum seekers.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living area per house is 184,000 euros, without land.
That's observable.
Six months has passed.
That's appropriate.
Did the construction regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: I went through my project correctly.
Especially complicated it always makes the threatening Damokles black special construction and the place regulation.
Terrible.
It is still subject to the need for at least three places to build three apartments in a row house.
Only in the cities there is no room for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents react to their row house project?
Gildner: There were some who suggested to create luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
What's definitely wrong.
But don't you strengthen the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: It is true that in the last five years we have had a building tree in Germany, but luxury apartments have been built that can hardly afford one more.
My project has the message, even the normal people need a living room.
Not only refugees, but also the only raising mother or the minor.
I'm showing you how you can still build cheap and good today.
That's why we're here.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and first dealt with environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is published
The new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app, typing on "General" and then choosing "software update".
If it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some have been hit by problems after installing, as they receive an error message that states that the "software update failed" has failed.
To address the problem, users are advised to wait either until the storm returns or tries to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more unlikely by closing the update. Also, it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and install them again once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is up to date or is in the vicinity of a charger so that the battery is loaded.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone may turn off half way and this could lead to a break in the update.

You should also ensure that before you download you have reviewed our checklist of all things to prevent things from going wrong and protecting yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that speed up and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's only currency: Full attack
Nico Rosberg knows in the fight about the WM title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton only one change: "Full Attack".
The WM second stressed before the start in the decisive seven overseas races, "that I have nothing to lose anymore".
53 points separate the world's champion before the night break in Singapore on this Sunday of title defenders and two-time champion Hamilton.
The British has already won seven of the 12 season races and takes the river light Grand Prix in the city as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Brit was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city will have influence at the high price of Singapore is still unclear.
For days a shower bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club, founded three months ago, "Schachfriend Bad Kissingen" has taken up another member in its series, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who has been on the course in Bad Kissingen more than 40 times.
Gauselmann is a carrier of the Bundesverdwirtschaftskreuz 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a donation that the president, Alfred Klein, took away.
It is thus possible to include chess players who cannot charge the membership contribution.
Youth and talent research should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership of the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club "Rot-White" will be seen as an expression of its relationship with the Kurstadt.
Quarter office looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Altencentrum Antonistift have come together under the cover of the Social Foundation and opened a new starting point at the Graf-Stauffenberg Square.
In addition to consultations, you can also take part in courses there.
The Social Foundation takes it down from the mountain into the city centre.
More precisely, at the Count Stauffenberg Square.
A new quarter office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and consultants are immediately receiving information on issues such as care insurance or the services of the health and care services.
For years, we have found that with our ambulance care service, caregivers are often left alone.
There are endlessly many questions.
"Also, not often many of the cash benefits are not taken into account, because the complexity of the insurance is not yet understood," explained the new Home Minister Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the citizen hospital as well as for the ambulance service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new quarter office also offers prevention, health care and wellness.
To this end, the Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, additional offers such as storm prevention, memory training or physical therapy can be used.
The offers from the Senior Centre and the Saludis are complemented in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, care and reha.
"The Senior Care and Care Centre," said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new headquarters in the city center is seen by both business leaders especially in the demographic change.
Because this makes good decentralized infrastructure in the individual parts of Bamberg in the future essential.
In addition, as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) stressed at the dedication celebrations, the neighborhood office also devoted itself to the association at the age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and invite them to a regular social meeting".
The Social Foundation thus made a major contribution to the ability of seniors to live as independently and well as in their familiar environment.
The quarter office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 o'clock, Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 o'clock and Saturday from 10 o'clock to 12 o'clock.
Intracht Bamberg v Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it is official: After the appointment of Fuchsparkstadion for the game FC Entracht Bamberg against the third party Würzburger Kickers has not yet been determined, the 6th of October has now been appointed as an appointment.
The meeting of the FC Entracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bavarian football totopokals against the third-party FC Würzburger Kickers was now complete.
It will be played on Tuesday, October 6, at 7:00 p.m. in Bumberger Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are happy that we now know when the game is over the stage, now we have planning security," said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the sale of cards now started.
It is especially important for our team to play against a third party.
We therefore look forward to numerous viewers, and this is not without reason, because fluctuating plays have a special time.
In the round of the last 16 teams, the FC Entracht Bamberg 2010 won the district league 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and home against the regional leagues 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition will receive 5000 euros and qualify for the first round of the DFB Association 2016/2017.
Title Defender is third-party climber SpVgg Unterhaching.
Vienna Architect Karl Mang died 92 years old
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna's architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5, at the age of 92, as the artist's house reported on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist house loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was said in the edition.
Born in 1922 in Vienna, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War.
Since 1952 he worked as a liberating architect, but also as a teacher, writer and institute manager.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute for Forming.
In the 1980s he was commissioned with the setting up of the treasure chamber in Vienna Hofburg and the reconstruction of the Palais Lobkowitz in the Austrian Theatre Museum.

He didn't give up intellectually on the other hand.
Wiese was allowed to cut his hair in the city of Bremer, when he saw a parking guard outside exhibiting a criminal record for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Then Wiese stormed out of the shop, hit the officer and threw the fines off her feet, as the "image" section reports.
At the city of Bremen you confirm the predictions, it is about the consequences for the unusual event but not yet in the clear.
"The thing is still in the test," says the city of Bremen.
Only after that will decide whether or not to show grass.
Authorities of Panama destroy 4500 Marihuana plants
The fertile soil and the rain forest-like climate of the Isla del Rey are best suited for the cultivation of Marihuana plants.
For three days, Panamanian authorities have destroyed 4,500 plants and burned them.
Men spread to 17-year-old Afghans
Witnessing is looking for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmunder: On Friday evening, at 23:45 p.m., three young men were on their way from Bad Soden to Salmunder.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends in a distance of about five meters, according to the police, and asked them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the height of the bft tank.
Three persons were also present on the site of the tank.
One of these men now yelled at the young man and struck him in the face with the fist.
The victim suffered a nose fracture and was bleeding out of the nose.
When his two friends marched out and sat down to the battle, he first left his victim.
His friends brought the injured young man home now.
The perpetrator pursued the group with a pkw up to their apartment and went through there demonstrably multiple times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured went before the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the fighter and another male person.
With the aid of a stroke, the victim's face and neck were struck.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical purposes.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second blower was about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and notifiers to report under telephone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Practice Felstehausen and invests 310000 Euros
Silvia Müller-Gongol and Frank Müller (left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
In addition, the mayor of the municipality of Bernd Bormann, the economist of Uta Seim-Schwartz, and Asenddorf, the mayor of Heinfried Kabbert, are pleased.
In many places in the country, there are no doctors - Asenddorf, however, is lucky: there Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of Felstehausen on October 1.
While Ursel Felstehausen is in rest, her husband, Karl-Heinrich, is still on the side of his successor in the coming months.
After a conversion phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October until then he invests 310000 euros in the premises at St. Marcellusstraße 6.
It was at first sight when the rock houses Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Goll, met at the same time performing their professional training in the World Hospital and wanted to join the practice next year.
"We always had in the back of our head that the müllers would fit in this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was so far, I just called them."
The couple Müller felt the idea of operating their own practice in Asenddorf in the future.
"The closeness and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says the 39-year-old müller.
"We want to meet and accompany the families over the years."
As an advantage, he also sees himself as his own boss soon.
And so you agreed, the millers bought the house with the practice.
They will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There, Frank Müller, the father of two families, was raised, his medical study in Hannover, in several medical practices, and in hospitals in Sullingen, Nienburg, and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as an supervisor in Sullingen, and in 2009 he was appointed as a leading notarist in Diepholz County and is a member of the DRC's Brechhausen-Vilsen Association.
From September 19th, the practice is being prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a house doctor, his Gattin Ursel (Internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internistants, want to leave home as doctors.
"The endoscopy therefore comes out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongol.
After the reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasonic investigations as well as long-term and load EKGs and need a more chat room.
In addition, the EDV is completely renewed.
A total of EUR 50000 is awarded to the millers under a programme of funding from the rural district (EUR 25000) and from the community council (12500 euros) and the community (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is being carried on," points out Joint Mayor Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongol, about 2000 patients come to the practice of rock houses every quarter, in which the Northern German average practice is about 500.
In Asenddorf, there is another practice of home medicine.
A positive side effect of the practice acquisition by Frank Müller: The apothecary remains according to Ursel Felstehausen in Asenddorf.
If no successor had been found, she would have gone too.
Those who visit Müller's talk hour also continue to look in the face of the familiar: it takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the rock houses.
With its departure ends in Asenddorf an era, however, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"At first we had only two rooms," recalls Ursel Felstehausen.
A little bit of wetness she's been chasing after a long time.
"But we are still living in Hohenmoor and many patients will probably still see," says the interiorist.
Your husband laughs: "We have a 6000 square meter base."
"Bisher I've always pushed myself before garden work, now it could be different."
The couple also has two ankles and enjoys travelling.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now the border controls are also high at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It remains clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can also make this "self-evidently".
The supply and security of people are at the forefront.
But it is also clear that "it needs clear signals," the Minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, nor across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled procedure.
Croatia Considers Corridor - Slovenia Refuses
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to allow incoming refugees to travel towards Austria and Germany and, under circumstances, to establish corridors for refugees.
However, this did not see the Minister of Interior Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", instead Slovenia will intensify border monitoring - especially to Hungary.
On the other hand, the border with Croatia has already been heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister stressed, Slovenia does not want to limit its borders to refugees.
"Each EU member must fulfil his or her obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," stressed Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government reported, the first refugees had already tried to cross the Tovarnik/Sid border in eastern Croatia in the evening hours to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to intervene in the nearby cornfields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly in contact with the Croatian army.
It is primarily about Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country is estimated to be about 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo at the Macedonian-Serbian border that had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border would be redirected towards Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade argues that it is it that people should be instructed to take certain routes: "We can, we still want to do this," it said.
According to the media reports, in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city of Sid would be expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The settlements were all night long from the Macedonian border about 500 km away through Serbia.
"We've heard that Hungary has joined, so the police told us we should go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could, in fact, result in the already predicted shift of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a slightly further westerly route.
Croatia: Comprehensive possibilities for border control
Croatian Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations for the case of a strong flow of refugees.
Details he did not mention, but he pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member has "wide-ranging possibilities for border control".
Strict checks are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Since 2007, Slovenia has been a member of the EU partners since then, as regards the standard of border controls, a good witness has been provided to the country.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees remain behind the Hungarian border.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the last night at the border crossing of Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
The Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down in the middle of the afternoon at a local auction in Horgos: he held the debate on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed.
It would not be very high numbers of refugees at the moment.
It is not possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Help counsel migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute to the refugees maps on which alternative routes are signed by Croatia.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe: there are still unencumbered mines in parts of the border area 20 years after the end of the Croatian war.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of miners were sent to the border region.
Exchange hacker: Ukrainian paying 30 million dollars
Supranok is supposed to have been a ring of cybercriminals, which has been proposed to have been providing insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwire and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information used should have included insider business on the financial markets.
In this way, the investigators have calculated a total of over $100 million.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our country borders will be finally captured," says the SEC Communication.
The proceedings against 32 other defendants were pending.
Most of the accused came from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators should have acted both in the United States and in Eastern Europe.
Economic hospice aid Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
Around the Mannheim Paradeplatz reigns in business.
People carry out their concerns, partly quick steps, partly welcoming.
They run the two stations of the Mannheim Car Salon at the parade.
Keep track of the city.
Pulsating, beautiful life in a beautiful autumn sun and in the middle of four large tables each with the title "Before I want to die"....
Economie hospice aid paid attention to its 20-year-old existence with this action and is clearly confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we've gone in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lamer.
The Head of the Ecumenical Hospital Assistance is also available to passengers for questions and conversations as well as to the honorary staff.
While some spontaneous passersby grabs at the cricket and the sentence "to age my life", "to read", "to drive through the United States with the camper," "to stop the war" or "not to suffer for long", others remain brief, read, say sentences like "as far as I am not yet" and then go on.
Small discussions on the action on itself, on life, on how to deal with death continue on the edge.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only if I make it clear to myself that at some point the end comes to me in this world, I can live with responsibility," says the Director of the Diaconic Mannheim Works, who is together with the Caritas Association bearers of the Ecumenical Hospital Assistance.
Therefore, this public action should be good for the 20-year-old.
The fact that not everyone wants to make public on the tables is, however, understandable, is finally a very personal matter.
The topic of death and death is still gripped with Tabus, so the experience of Josefine Lamber, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening up of people.
An estimate sharing Angelika Godefroid.
The death and mourning companion is one of the honorary employees of the first hour.
Faced with the subject of personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the death care.
When the Ecumenical Hospitality Assistance was sought by the Office, it was immediately reported and was at the time of its establishment in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 honorary officials - 43 women and two men - accompanied by the affected and members of private homes, hospitals, nursing homes and the Sankt Vincent Hospital.
They're all trained carefully.
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with her task and the experiences and experiences involved.
"I see the life of another wait, hold it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the ambulance ecumenical hospice service is free of charge and free of charge.
The financial support of hospitals and donations from relatives and associations enables training as well as training and supervision of the death and mourning attendants.
Every two years, training is offered for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now displayed in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There are also other personal wishes on postcards.
FedEx mixed result, financial perspectives for 2016 reduced
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the supplier-giant reduced its profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said that it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At that time, FedEx announced last year that the company wanted to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The share fell over 2.5 percent in the premarket trade 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the business year, which ends next May, 20 cent less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected an inquiry of FactSet $10.84.
The lower outlook comes despite the price increases of on average 4.9 percent and becomes effective on 4 January and despite higher subsidies for land transport of heavy and large packages to be collected from November.
The company said that it still expects the result to be increased over the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trade.
Charman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "makes solid profits when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival UPS, which plans to set up 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, such as the same number as last year.
In the quarter, which ended on 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The result for each share was $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, which twelve analysts asked for.
The turnover rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zacks' analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has reported a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which led to the stagnation of sales in its unit of express shipping.
But the tree in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, land transport sales increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result fell due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In premarket trade, about an hour before opening, the FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday it closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a recorddoch on 11 June.
At its most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserve Strategen spends two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to raise the lead for the first time for almost a decade.
Threatening about them at the end of the depleted, double-chaired meeting room is a wall picture of the United States.
The map is a reminder that F-president Janet L. Yellen and his colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation ahead of all other things.
The Central Bank has a two-fold mandate from the Congress: maximising US employment and keeping prices stable here.
But since the great recession, the fed leader has acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be exempted from the exampleless incentive by the short-term interest rate that is close to zero since the end of 2008.
Although most economic data show that they are growing solid, the latest turbulence on global financial markets could scare the already prudent Fed representatives to increase this volatility by raising the interest on federal bonds - and it is also only a quarter of a percentage.
"The labour market and inflation will obviously be the most important thing they're watching," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Makler company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think, if they were looking for a pretext not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue waiting," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which will insure the financial market itself.
About half of the economies that were recently questioned by Bloomberg predicted a rise in interest this week.
However, the financial markets are expected to wait for the Fed, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market, if the feed increases the rate, it is that the streetmen will heal the blow by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or by 1.4% to 16,599,85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy maintains the sentence this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise the bets at that time," he said.
If she does, "she had to go very far in her statement to calm down the financial markets so that they wouldn't panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest rates would calm the financial markets, because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
One month ago, the fed seemed to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow strengthening of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States.
In the spring and early summer, Yelle had said that in spite of the complaints by Liberals that more economic progress would be necessary, she expected an increase in the rate.
Although the creation of jobs slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was strong this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the last month, the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level seen by the fed as full employment.
Increases in wages have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can manage higher interest rates and needs them because of the pressure on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets all over the world came together at the end of the last month, after China had valued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% in May when investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would dampen global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the dow now being almost 10% below the peak of May.
For the fed representatives, market turbulence affects the complex calculation when the interest is to be increased.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would be pulling the triggers at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former U.S. notary bank employee.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to get the effects better in the grip.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy, and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the fed, so it should not be technically involved in its finding.
But in the end, the Fed has become the currency authority of the world.
The central bank's influence has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication of the then leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "enlarge" its monetary expansion, triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, the Fed representatives can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global asset management strategy of Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, V., observed this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that are apparently not related to economic fundamental data."
Lacker, a voter member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which used to raise interest, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its lead by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "in spite of limited impact on growth in the USA", Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed representatives withdrew these cuts.
The Fed should first place aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the collapse of the market in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest-fixing committee.
The latest turbulences do not come near this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a rise in interest because the markets are excited," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not believe that it should advance the time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/store was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Thai Town.
The market/station is a central starting point and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need motor oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes about an hour to slide through the corridors.
If the whole shopping is hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and priced) in this shop is close to the boxes and has various reception options.
What is there here: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C's probably got it.
Products are priced and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat tea is extensive as well as the fish tea - the staff behind the tea will clean and fillify the fish and even break on request for you.
A good part of the shop is part of the massive freezer department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and gallant, whole ducks, fish, bovine blood and galle, pig guts, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys in here: restaurant owners and kitchens, including individual families and individuals.
The wide ranges are suitable for shopping cars and forklifts.
You can find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the box.
Where it is located: The shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and the city center - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the charge is well visited, it is not hard to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small Life Help for Refugees
More and more refugees come to Germany these days.
To prepare you a warm welcome, does not go without the commitment of countless noble helpers.
In Hoyerswerda too, there are a whole number of people who support unsolicited asylum seekers in the city.
These include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
With her 74 lenses, she still likes to teach.
She does it every Thursday at the Dillinger Straße in the asylum competition.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn the German language.
Of course, this is a whole different teaching than at a right school.
Brazil's Paediatric Society Rio Grande promotes food for healthy silences
The Brazilian Paediatric Organization SPRS tries to find out in a shocking way how important good food is during the time of silence. It does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who suck on breasts that are painted with images of unhealthy foods.
Mother milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers will be able to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research results indicate that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A current study conducted by Robert Waterland, professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can adversely affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Berneries Sporthalle
The municipality of Bernried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro expensive sporthalle.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be smoother for solar system.
The plans for the long-standing construction of tournaments at the Bernreid sports grounds are progressing step by step: at the most recent municipal meeting, the design proposal was unanimously approved without much discussion.
The Board had previously decided, among other things, to apply for a "exemption" or "exemption" from the valid construction plan.
The "exception" was the permit for a special form of roof construction.
Thus, a "satisfaction with non-military first and ceiling" is to be created.
On the basis of the planning, the intended use of the roof area for solar systems is: "This brings us together a wonderfully large Southdach," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
In turn, the "freedom" was intended to be less than 10 degrees for energy reasons, other than those prescribed in the construction plan.
The volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced.
A "freedom" was therefore necessary because the construction plan does not allow "exemption" in the case of the roofing - with the Bernreier municipality being generally more restrictive in the case of relief applications.
However, in the construction of the tournament, it is not a recurring project: "We do not create a presidential fall," says Steigenberger.
The tournament building at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and of the SV Bernried.
At the cost of around 2.3 million euros are calculated.
Grants are expected from the promotion of school and broadband.
In the next step, the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall will now be submitted to the Land Council for examination.
Pißenberg clinic to Schongau
The Pißenberg Hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - that is 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) will become the new medical director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of the employees move from Pißenberg to Schongau.
This is what the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county, confirmed by Landrätin Andrea Jochner-White, are.
However, a decision on this will be taken by the Supervisory Board, and it will take place on Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were implemented, all of the almost 50 employees at the hospital in Pißenberg would be further employed.
The overwhelming majority are to move to Schongau with fishermen and the remaining internal station.
The rooms were there.
The employees who cannot go to Schongau will be offered a job in Weilheim, according to Jochner-White.
The employees are informed of the plans.
The change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has been a medical director of Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice near the hospital.
On the question of who should follow up, according to Jochner-White, the name "fisher" came into the game, which was ready to take the lead from October 1st and move with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau this in any case meant a "revaluation" and an extension of the offer in the area of "Other Medicine", according to Jochner-White.
Fisher is a specialist for heartmakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized in gastroenterological diseases at the interior station.
For the next two years, Fisher and his team will, if the Supervisory Board agrees, lead both houses until next year, the former hospital of the disease, which still has 35 beds, will be finally closed in Pittenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the county has planned this for 2018 when the current recovery at Weilheim Hospital has been completed.
Landrättin Jochner-White, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, opposed the announcement that the house, which is in the possession of the federal deficit, should be used in the future as accommodation for asylum-seekers.
As with the property, Jochner-White could not say that there are several considerations.
At present, there is a short-term care for Caritas and a daily psychiatric treatment.
"What better thing could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come back," says Fischer about the cursive drive to the Lech that was "positive and very understanding" taken by the employees.
There has been no real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as chief for over 30 years.
He was asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the positions of the Medical Director.
The Pißenberg Hospital (one hundred beds) has been under constant threat of closure in recent decades, departments have been closed, such as surgery and birth care.
The handballs of the Rhine-Neckar Löwen are required tonight (20.15 am) at the Bergish HC.
The Federal League's table guide is in Wuppertal, although the clear favorite, but there is no cause for superiority.
In the last season, the bathers at BHC had a painful downfall and had some good taste there.
Hunting accident with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were severely injured during their maesership on Tuesday afternoon by shots.
During the evening on a corn field near Pratau (Landkreis Wittenberg) several hunters were in use, as the police reported.
After a shooting, a 63- and 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
Just as it could have happened, it was not clear at first.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-olds from Rheinland-Pfalz Victims of Violence
A suspect has led the police to the body of 16-year-olds from Rheinland-Pfalz who have been missing since Saturday.
In the hearing, the 20-year-old added that the young people were killed and that their bodies were thrown into a channel in rock houses.
A 16-year-old from Rheinland-Pfalz has been killed since Saturday.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday in Rockenhausen at Kaiserslautern, as state prosecutors and police reported on Wednesday.
As a suspect, a 20-year-old who was arrested on Tuesday night was also considered to be a suspect and led the investigator to the foundation of the body.
The 16-year-old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home as agreed upon after a visit to a autumn party in Rockenhausen.
When looking for the young woman, the investigators first focused on personal objects of the victim.
In the case of questionings in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing persons, a suspicion was finally expressed against the 20-year-olds.
The moderate perpetrator then led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen where the body was found.
According to the authorities in the police investigation, the prisoner killed the 16-year-olds and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was supposed to be brought to the court on Wednesday, and the investigators put him to death.
A review of the circumstances of the case should be made of further investigations.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns against apartment accidents
The situation on the German apartment market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for a payable stay.
The pressure on the apartment market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have started for the longest time.
With the coming EU refugees and job seekers, more and more people are pushing into a market that is already being loaded down in many major cities.
They compete with poor citizens for the last affordable apartments.
In order to cover the demand for affordable apartments, 400,000 new units had to be built each year by 2020.
This results in a study on behalf of the Association of Social Housing.
For comparison: This year 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
This means 140,000 apartments are missing.
Refugees are no longer obliged to live in an asylum-seeker after the first three months of their stay.
Many then enter the apartment market and enter the long hoses in front of the apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers lived in the last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not limited to the rising numbers of refugees.
The study has also made significant losses in housing policy over the last few years.
Germany faces a housing deficit that is growing from year to year.
Currently, about 770,000 living units were missing in the dance areas, reported by Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore lived in major cities forced into WG rooms.
Young adults remained reluctantly in the "Hotel Mama" because of the fluctuations on the apartment market.
In the major cities, the number of square meters per head has been reduced for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the Association of Social Housing proposes a new start.
New incentives should be reinvigorated in social housing.
In this way, the basic taxes could be waived and the basic taxes imposed on funded apartments would be suspended.
In addition, according to the alliance, attractive tax options are necessary.
The funding programme for refugee shelters of the KfW State Bank is already well under way in cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start of the Monday evening, more than half of the 300 million euros available had already been collected with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be stocked up.
Refugees have free guidance: Croatia and Slovenia set up Corridor
According to Hungary, there is virtually no escape, as more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia.
Zagreb announces to provide the journey through Slovenia to the north without any threats.
But the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to understand with its neighbours Slovenia the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I spoke to the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
The EU country of Croatia is not a Schengen country yet.
After the Serbian-Hungarian border is shut down, hundreds of refugees have broken down to Croatia in order to reach Western Europe.
500 people came across the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian TV RTL.
Hungary had cut off its borders on refugees in the morning.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, also make ordinary asylum procedures virtually redundant in Hungary.
Croatia wants the refugees to pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, there are women, children and men who live and want to achieve something.
However, there were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had attacked Croatia's first refugees at the border of Serbia in the morning.
Most media reports have been reported from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and by taxi to the Serbian border city of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to reach Croatia on foot over the green border.
On the Croatian-Serbian border, refugees do not cross the border.
There are other dangers to the border zones: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Mining facilities should now quickly create a safe passage.
After the border is closed to Hungary, there are hardly more refugees.
On Tuesday, the police took 366 people.
Shortly before the end of Monday, there were 9380.
The new Hungarian laws impose the overcoming and damaging of the border zone as a criminal offence.
Therefore, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern border city of Szeged.
The convicted are threatened with imprisonment for up to five years and the removal from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" on the border, almost all of them - 93 - at the most important crossing of Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, there were still 40 refugees.
However, virtually no one else has an opportunity to receive asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The refused asylum seekers are to be moved there.
Before the "transit zone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In Röszke, workers began to clean up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the road in the past weeks.
Sperrgitter was demolished and one of the recording camps in the border area was rebuilt.
For the purpose of this reconstruction, no one wanted to express themselves.
Austria reaches only a few refugees after the border between Serbia and Hungary is closed.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
According to government data, about 20,000 migrants remained in the country.
In Salzburg, some 1,400 people are waiting for the move to Germany.
The train journey from there to Germany was stopped on the morning of the German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees met regularly.
Mayor "Gestrandette" drove across the border
"We were busy cleaning after the bridge party on Sunday, when all of a sudden ten people with travel suitcases were at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
Because on Sunday, however, because of the refugee flow, Germany had put the rail traffic in Austria to a surprise, it was in Wernstein's conclusion," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the beachmen along with two other helpers and their cars over the border to the nearby Passau.
Previously, we had eaten the unexpected guests, with juice and drinks.
We just said we'd take them by car to Passau.
"That was of course for us," said Stadler in the OÖN discussion.
They were very grateful.
A man did not allow himself to hand over a generous gift - 100 euros for the firefight.
"That made us very happy," Stadler said.
On Sunday evening, the beached train passengers moved from an ICE to a regional train to Passau in order to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that rail traffic was stopped to Germany.
However, the regional transport was postponed before the border in Wernerstein at Inn.
In Wernstein, the border crossing is generally high in the course.
The bridge party is associated with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday, days before a two-bridge race – organized by the Union Wernstein and Bayern from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending us another thousand visas is a logical result of a secular policy:
Instead of helping immediately with the establishment of structures to ensure humanity in the camp, our Federal Chancellor has put the attitude of the Hungarian government in the Dunstkreis of National Socialism high-level and public.
The leaders of this policy are not only the Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also have to find that the "received country", which they have invited and welcomed, is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge in view of the continuing flows of refugees and the approaching winter to create decent conditions for protection seekers.
And it will be even greater - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad looking for 35,000 winter parties accommodation
Konrad has all his hands full with the escape.
Christian Konrad is used to saying that his word has weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to build quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first recording centre of Traiskirchen has already been captured by Konrad.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported on his first success.
The accommodation of 20,000 refugees who had arrived in Austria on Monday was also done without great vertebrae, Konrad said and praised the organizational "master performance".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "critical situation".
Overall, Konrad has a need for 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 more accommodation will have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 will provide the countries, 15,000 of the fed.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a phase without ground," said Konrad.
He has already had discussions with the Heads of State.
They would have assured him that he would also create accommodation for the future refugees.
"In Upper Austria it's going well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP Mandater supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, explaining how the church will help.
The asylum coordinator also places great expectations in the ORF action "Help as We".
On the platform, individuals can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
In addition, you hope for hotels that are empty in winter.
Yesterday Konrad and Maier criticised the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of need, it may not be that quarters have to keep a certain height of the hand-held or the size of the upper lights.
For a period of time, "not standards" should apply.
In contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, Konrad is more successful in providing accommodation, and his experience is based on his experience.
I am an older man who is not being told the truth without another face.
Convinced power is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cost the Republic as they themselves explained.
Their number of employees wants to increase to three to four.
The search for his own quarters has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
However, there are obvious problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better distribution
First, there is no opening of urban sports and other buildings such as Tip Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees, the city of Linz plans.
This is not necessary at the moment, as it is possible to stop the people in question without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, for the emergency, further locations should be checked for their daring.
Criticism is practiced by the head of the city in the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other areas must also make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "limits are not abolished"
In a longer phone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Landeshauptmann Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on Monday's next move on the issue of refugees.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be abolished.
The further travel of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
There will be no more special flights with refugees to Germany.
However, protection seekers would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
From the other EU Member States, Pühringer once again called for enhanced solidarity in the issue of refugees.
For Pühringer, Austria is "a logical consequence" from the German process.
The next Runtastic is a question of time
The generalization of the "new yard" in the Linzer industrial line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT group S&T is drawn, the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology area.
"In the IT are the smart heads of our raw material - and we have to try to work for us," says S&T Chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He can imagine investing in start-up companies in the new firm and then buying any.
From the beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - some of which Niederhauser promises: "The next Runtastic is just a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which is one third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the Federal Republic (FFG).
The building is covered by the Linz AG for 60 years to S&T as well as Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters remains in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent there are requests.
Lia-Peroni owner opened second business in the arcade
The new shop focuses on Furla handbags.
In fact, Jutta Breit wanted to raise a dog.
This project had to be cut short by the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the Taubenmarkt Arkada: she has now grown up in the form of another business location.
In the Furla shop, opposite the store where they sell pockets, suitcases, shoes and clothing from different manufacturers, everything is now turning around to have women’s handbags at the Furla brand, money exchanges are from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
Since yesterday, the new shop is in operation.
It was rebuilt several weeks earlier.
"But I've been wondering for a long time if I should open another store," says Breit.
The decision was decisive, among other things, that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also affected by the idea of their own place where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the large area of Linz who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who owns Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has got width from her mother into the scales.
Most of the time, when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why can't the expert answer with the latest certainty when looking at a nice handbag?
Maybe it's because a nice bag evaluates every outfit.
The puzzle maker from Callstadt
The Pälzer precedents of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are named.
This property is also linked to the billionaire who wants to become president of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether it is foreign, journalists are concerned with fraud or knowledge gaps in international crisis policy, the candidate for the US President's office is strongly reversing the election.
And cut off well.
This is also recorded in the town of Call, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the Féhnfrissur is a term for many in the wine village on the wine street.
Some in the 1200-society location are over -zig corners related to him.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in the election mode.
The cold city woman Simone Wendel filmed a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think those who find it kind of exciting, but are not so impressed in their call city style either," says Simone Wendel.
The native cold town has filmed a fun documentary about the place and its famous spruces, including the Ketchup family Heinz in addition to Trump.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, comes to "Kings of Callstadt" (2014) as well - with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Callstadt.
He didn't bring it there to the king of hearts.
Although there is respect for the performance of the family, it also tends to think that Trump is "a bit of a big mouth", says Wendel.
By chance, the name of the town called in the area is "The Brulljesmacher" - in German: the teller, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the narrators.
The Trump's success story began in 1885 when the later Grandfather expanded and opened a site for gold miners in the United States.
The foundation of the real estate group was the first land purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy: your desire to return to the home for a long time was broken by the Bavarian state, to which the people belonged at the time.
He didn't take Trump because he was one of those once without permission, the director of the Institute for Pälse History and National Art, Roland Paul, had declared the film launch.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal emigrator".
This is in contrast to the underlying marked statements of the offspring.
He had repeatedly spoken apostately about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to scare illegal immigrants.
"As the potter does, it is not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("The grandmother was a born trumpet, the grandfather was born Heinz").
The winner at rest sees the American rather distant, "he's always so exciting".
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says 72-year-old.
"He never took care of Call City."
The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions like some Callstadters that a descendant of the Heinz family at a visit gave something to the church organ, which was generally well achieved.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says 68-year-olds.
She found it better if he didn't win the election, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good."
If those who had the matter at the time of his grandfather in the United States had been like him, "where he never got there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzer daughter Sarah Bühler.
What about as president?
"It isn't my president," she says.
And, "The grapes will also be ripe without the President Trump."
Wendels Film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 filmmakers, also in the United States.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf".
According to the Vice President at the German Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfenig, the 1800s village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 "Gergsteiger villages".
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "Bergsteigerdorf" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be identified as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the evaluations, despite Nina's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at today's show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson moved to Canberra to report the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but there have been no major changes in the evaluations for today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast by the Bundeshauptstadt, when Malcolm Turnbull created Tony Abbott's crash.
The rival Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was part of a weekly series of international television broadcasts in London, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise achieved an average of 397.000 spectators in the five main cities, compared to Today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday (317.000) and last Tuesday (283.000), but its number remained behind the last Thursday (343.000).
Today has closed the gap on Sunrise in the last few months.
Today, on average, 318,000 reached in August compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, in September, Sunrise stands at an average of 349,000 spectators to 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The wind of change concerns these people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the check!

The great novelty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star from Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently-white father, who decides to leave with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could carry a hit show Solo without the rappers Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last evening answered this with a clear "yes".
The X-factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million spectators and slightly beat The Block (838.000) and TBL families (726.000).
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 5.30 p.m.) of the new Quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe on average 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 till 18:00) ran to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot Seat (613.000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 spectators, and in the second half hour it was 720,000.
Hot seat on average 620,000.
The decline in the quotas of the second evening of The Chase Australia will be likely to agree that the hot-seat will finally take place at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for millions of dollars a minute that didn't make it to fly the McGuires show.

The last three votes agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Revealed Secret? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have revealed incredibly who wins the Bachelor.
The woman who finally landed Sam Wood in The Bachelor was kept secret.
And not one of the three remaining girls will certainly be rewarded if she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows on the day before becoming out of two, you may have accidentally indicated who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women turned out to be lyrically why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor, pride, family values and positive attitude as a reason why they want to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If you don't who should get Wood's last rose?", their answers to the game destroyer, who won the heart of the Bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski called both fast - except for themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day.
"From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam's energies, I felt they were pretty compatible, and I thought about it all over the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah stands on the ground with both feet, it makes so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I saw them together, and they've got the right chemistry.
They feel pleasant and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be a good couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that last week the house visit made it clear that Wood could be one.
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I'm now totally on him," she said.
And when she was asked, who would choose Wood, if she didn't, she was furious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the rest of the girls alike - it's an indecisive between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open day of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsula and looks like a smart decision.
Some trainers would have banned Hayne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a ring like the Aussie-Rugby-Liga convert on his first point return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a point-back and also to the current game after a breach of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game.
He encouraged her instead of making her smokes in front of the rest of the team through the mill.
Tomsula also strengthened Hayne publicly in his press conference after the game.
The 49th sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who encouraged him to forget his captured catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne writes at a point that was restored in the first game district of the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the beginning, the Hayne and his massive Australian succession for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the playing field shortly after the Fumble and later told Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1, that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens now, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the snitzer to his original debut in 2007, when a pass in his own in-goal area led to a trial for Queensland.
Overall, it was still a great experience for the 27-year-olds.
Hayne posted for a photo with fans and held an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of the Schulen
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested in a Siberian field with gun violence.
After challenging President Vladimir Putin openly, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company seized Yukos and banned his democratic efforts.
The free voters call for the establishment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria due to the high numbers of refugees.
The party and group leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW Heritage Clause in Großwallstadt against a severe crisis in Bayern's schools, if there are no new teachers for many new students, "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapsing," said Aiwanger.
"Sometimes we'll get recruitments in the Bavarian education system."
The Landdays of the Free Elections takes place until Friday in the sub-frequent municipality.
In fact, other main topics were envisaged.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Elections meeting.
"Of course, the topic of asylum will overcome the Klausur," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN shields for refugees in Syria, as it did during the Yugoslavian war in the nineties.
"That's not the way it goes, we have to do the reasons," said the Free Electoral Chief.
Declined asylum seekers want to remove the free voters as soon as possible.
Therefore, Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints: "We also need at least 50 new asylum lawyers," said Aiwanger.
The FW chief criticised that several federal countries were not consistent: "We need uniform standards across the federal state."
"Bayern's moving away, others don't."
"That's where we need to be more capable of action."
But national policy in Großwallstadt is not supposed to fall under the table.
A year-long burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
As a new year of school, Culture Minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) at 47 Gymnasia launched the pilot test "middle level plus" in which an extension of the secondary level is tested from three to four years - the result will then be nine years to Abitur.
But that's not enough for Aiwanger.
"The G9 theme needs to be accelerated," said the FW Chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all gymnasiums who want to do so.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.
Fester Wall Street helps Dax to jump
The German stock market has closed down over a wide range of directionless and nervous trading with profits.
Only in the afternoon was a firmer rise in US stock exchanges for a clear direction that finally moved the dax by 0.56 percent to 10 188.13 points above.
The MDax averaged 0.54 percent to 19,552,88 points.
The technologically flexible TecDax increased by 1.03 percent to 1736.69 points.
The EuroStoxx 50 as the Eurozone's lead index averaged 1.01 per cent to 3207.60 points.
Solid wins also booked the trading venues in London and Paris.
In the United States, the Dow-Jones index last noted about 1 percent in the plus.
Many Bursians expect that the markets will take place until after the interest rate decision in the United States and also for the large decrease in the deadlines on this Friday.
The discussion on the loads from the atomic rise has temporarily pushed the shares of RWE into a record depth and left deep traces at Eon.
According to "Spegel", the German energy groups may lack 30 billion euros in reserves.
The Federal Government dismissed the figures mentioned in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy groups recovered slightly, but eventually lost 3.31 per cent (RWE) and 6.15 per cent (Eon).
Infineon shares increased at the Dax point by another 3.22 percent.
According to a dealer, a positive report from the US depositor magazine "Barron's" came after the weekend.
Thus, investors gave too little attention to the German Chipbauer at the moment.
Investments in future wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid off.
Car values were asked: Even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were replaced than in the previous year, as the Acea industry association announced at the beginning of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt.
The papers of the autobuilder Daimler and BMW added by 1.34 percent or 2.21 percent.
Volkswagen's advances were estimated at 1.26 percent.
In the German interest market, the turnover of registered stock exchange securities fell to 0.48 (Friday: 0.50) per cent.
The Rex pension index rose by 0.12 percent to 139.55 points.
The federal future lost 0.71 percent to 154.11 points.
The euro's price fell to $1,1262 last afternoon.

The dollar thus cost 0.8846 (0.8875) Euro.
4 people killed after police shooting rubber shots on demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber shots in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution, an officer said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday night in the Rupandehi District, approximately 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Head of District Officials, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said that the police had used Trengengas and then shot into the air before she attacked rubber shots.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber shots used, known to kill, but which were traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high rate of death.
The dispute was the last week of violent protests in southern Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group said that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus who want a state of their own.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been involved in violent clashes since 10.
August was killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial topic in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
The work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Emmer Youth Centre Old Post is to be rebuilt again.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000-square meter area.
A mixture of trade, commerce and housing is planned - concrete offers are not yet available.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a large plot of approximately 4000 square meters in the immediate vicinity of the Old Post youth centre.
Preparations are currently under way.
It is planned to use the land for a mixture of trade, commerce and housing.
You wait for the corresponding offers, it's from the city.
Any investor's inquiry is not clear yet.
In line with this, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had bought part of the property located on the Ringstraße / Ecke Grandestraße, a few months ago and let the building on it be covered.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
Plans for holiday home at the Small Sea at Emden take shape.
The investor introduced public plans for the project for the first time.
Some investors are still concerned - they fear the sale of their leisure refuge
For months, closed doors were negotiated, grumbled, debated and signed.
Now the plans for a new holiday home on the Small Sea are close to Emden on the table.
The interested, the medium-sized Elder company "System-Bau", presented his plans for the first time on Monday in the city development committee of the Elder Council.
This item had originally stood on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of project critics and the FDP Group, who challenged the investors and the administration of secret creameries, Ralf Behrends went to the Offensive from the System-Building Directorate: "We do not yet have an answer to all questions," he told the Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
It has been in the debate for about ten to twelve million euros.
The images and new details called for the desired hotel construction of severe reactions among seabender owners who came to the meeting.
Roberto Schulz, the owner of the sea and the board member at the representatives of the investors, Pro Hieve, complained: "This is a giant club that surpasses all other buildings".
He also fears, like several other project critics, that traffic would increase strongly by the intended size of the plant: "There must be all bus charges to calculate this," says Schulz.
However, what is happening on the very good hectar of the large area of the former guesthouse is still open.
There's no operator yet.
"We must have a key concept first," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this is still missing, the construction plans are still variable.
Two-year-olds at Gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is happy to grow up with its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Diana brought twins to the world yesterday.
The birth of twins is rare in Gorillas.
The last in a German zoo is almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, it is called the Zoo.
The sex of the newborn gorilla twins has not yet been established, since Mother Diana has so far kept them close in the body.
At first, the "Image" had been reported.
NHC predicts 60% chance for Cyclones south of Cape Verde
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center said a wide depth printing system of approximately 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verden islands, which has a 60-percent chance to develop into a tropical vertebral storm in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined deep pressure system, for example, in the middle between Cape Verde and the Small Antilles, also has a 60-percent potential to form a tropical vertebral storm in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google starts a double donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a double donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations, to help thousands of refugees who have overwhelmed the European nations, as they flee from war and poverty.
Google has an unusually personal approach to making a donation on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experience.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperate for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first global donations up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeerelief will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled from the war - torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.
Report by Yasmeen Abutaleb; working by Christian Plumb
For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote a editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or adipositional surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, adipositas operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proved effective, but most studies have been conducted in people who are ill-fated with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in terms of size, is considered as normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI of more than 30 are considered fat.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 comparing two types of adipositional surgery - stomach bypass and stomach tumor formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The mean BMI among those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
On the other hand, the BMI remained at approximately 29 with those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments.
Among those undergoing surgery, 36% resolved diabetes in whole and 28%.
In the medically-treated group, in comparison, diabetes was completely resolved by only one percent and in part by only about two percent.
In addition, the results of blood pressure controls, triglyceride and the "bad" LDL cholesterol were "in general better in the "surgical" group", the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the patient’s blood levels of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects the blood sugar levels over time.
Haemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, according to researchers.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin A1c decreased from approximately 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the medical group, it remained stable by about 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - as you reflect in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, so the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compares average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the gastrextomy group (18.7 vs 14.2 kg), achieved higher reductions in BMI (7.4 vs 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs 2.1%) and reported a complete excess of diabetes (46.9% vs 16.7%).
While the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of more difficult people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study it was for healthy people who underwent an adipositional surgery to die about 29 percent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show any benefit for the survival of the surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"That is the critical point of this study, because she says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," she said, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have collected these genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a conversion is really difficult."
Love story plays in the back of the Huns
It is a topic that is now growing in Belletristik: A young woman, unloved and insensitive at school, meets her youth's scarcity again after years, and this one falls in love with her.
So also in the recently published novel "We Are Not Like This" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the story of love, the novel should be especially interesting for Hunsrücken readers, because he plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The main professional author has grown up in Langweiler and is happy that she was able to place a literary monument to her home.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan-Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is devoted to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents in the circumstances.
He also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was remarkable, but the situation was not appropriate.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama Germany and Austria praised efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"The care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions like real peace and real development, mainly through education, which can be created for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we must consider how killing in their countries is reduced.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama referred to the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions following the terrorist attack of 11 September and said that the violent reaction of the United States had drawn a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I put my leave in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is in vain.
"I know his motives were good, but he put on violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the intake of hand infection by children in the last 4 years
Drug control centres in the United States report a nearly 400-percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow heavily alcoholic hand disinfectants, says the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gailord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the incidence of income from hand infection in children under 12 years of age reported by poison control centres rose from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them are going to be taken in the emergency," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mute test on social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young disinfectants drink only because of a cheap experience.
Young people reportedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouth water to obtain a stronger drink.
Younger children can be Angelized by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those who are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberries, grapefruit and orange juice, which are very suitable for children.
Hand infection agents contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in small children, few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Gift Center in the hospital of the University of Kansas, Sender Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So, you wouldn't let a leak of whiskey stand around, but people let these hand disinfectants in a range of children, and when children come to it, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaija Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four sprays of hand infection in the school, was treated in an emergency.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice as high as the threshold that is legally applicable to an adult as drunk, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, a emergency hospital doctor who treated her in the Winnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nahiah kept her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital on signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through alcohol and had hit her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaija's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and to store hand infections outside the child's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with fatalities.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand infections that included a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials assume that the product contains methanol, a lethal solution, instead of ethyl alcohol, which has been listed as active substance.
In January, three of the fourth grade students in New York planned to poison their "common" teacher by exposing antibacterial products around the teaching area," reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand infection and banned it from her room.
The police viewed the plan as "sweet" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwingingen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver has been easily injured in a cross-country accident between the Nordring and the Horsemen.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove across the crossroads in the direction of the circuit industry area and took too late to realize that two leading vehicles had stopped in the circuit.
As a result, with his truck he pushed into the corner of an Audis and pushed this vehicle onto a front Ford Fiesta.
In the accident vehicles, damage was caused by around EUR 10,000, the police report.
The audience of the 33-year-old was no longer ready to travel and had to be dragged away.
Kitchen: No Disharmonie at Celtic
Griffiths plays the line of disharmonie at Celtic Glasgow, adding that the Hopes are in a bad place, but that he will turn it again.
Hearts will fight SFA because of the charge of Neilson and Warburton will be cautious in January commitments that could destroy the unit of the camp
Dons increase lead over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's Elfmeter in the first half of the year gave Aberdeen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so the Dons create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays directly over disharmonie
There are reports of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which has been deliberately rejected by Griffiths. This was because he and his team comrades are not under increased control, as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch table guide.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in the Scottish football season Netherlands - de Boer
The former Rangers Midfield player and former Dutch national player Ronald de Boer said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic, since there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently a messenger for Ajax, said, "In Holland they don't show any highlights of Celtic games anymore and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here are not only talking about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about the old firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the old firm games, and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm going to turn things around, Dela.
RONNY Sharea has accepted that Celtic has to fight, but the Norwegian boss has sworn to turn things around.
Following the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League, the defeat against 10 men from Aberdeen, which now stands at the top of the table with five points ahead.
But Dela said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we'll be back."
Now we want to get out as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel that way - but we have to move on.
We really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
It's so important to be together now.
Warburton Careful at January Transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he indicated some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is careful when signing new arrivals and insists that he does not want to disrupt the Ibrox Framework.
Brentford's ex-chief said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in the summer have this preseason time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is arranged by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic-Zielperson Michu with return notice
Swansea storm Michu, with Celtic during the transfer period in the conversation, indicated that he could withdraw when his contract expires at the Swans.
The 29-year-old has been hooked up with a lousy bone for two years and has not made the withdrawal from Wales this summer.
Hearts on SFA fight set for Neilsson comments
The hearts led 2:1, as Patterson was sent from the field and then lost 3:2, but the red card of the defendant was later lifted - the third red card of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson continues what he said, and continues: "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynacastle
The unparalleled hibee was justified after he admitted to singing a song with aggressive lyrics about Ex-Hearts Player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a button in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Derby in Tynacastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the stormer, adding: "It's safe to say that I'm not going back to Tynacastle if it's not for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has trust in Dundee-United Management
Simon Donnelly insists that the board of Dundee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but says that the downfall has to end on the field.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We'll get the boys back to work," said Donnelly.
McInne's happy to win against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes argues that his team from Aberdeen had to fight against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic on the upper edge of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's Elfmeter in the first half.
McInnes said, "There is no team that has won everything in puzzle games or leagues that have not won this kind of game."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while it is rising in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9% was above that of the UK of 5.5%, as shown by the figures of the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 70.0 per cent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
The Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The long-term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Controversies disturbed the course
Since the security staff could not clear the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepperspray could the officers take care of the disturbances.
A breath alcohol test occurred at a 16-year-old, 0.89 promille.
The adult was taken by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 promille and was first in custody.
Why I'm a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a later legal intervention, I'll see how a man is killed.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber in Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew closer, I began to fear myself.
So why would I do that?
I agreed, because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can see devices in the United States, and since more applications are often available than places, a makeable lottery takes place to decide who is selected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five.
Anyone who is selected will be able to observe it without emotion.
I can't.
I will sit next to Richard Glossips, a close friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephones and a two-and-a-half hour visit.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me of giving up my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he wants, and you will be given access.
I'm complaining about her.
She admitted that she "could have formulated it better", but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him he could get me out of his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks the public work of the movement will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter at the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts that I have made.
I don't want to go back to all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his orientation is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'll see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can turn.
What you get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man confused after wet police chase hunting to come from the Canning River
The Canning Vale police officer remained dry when he beat the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the soft and suspense water, only a few meters away from a police officer, who tried to "slowly persuade him to return to the shore."
The police of Canning Vale were called on Tuesday to a house break in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I won't come out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandel Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited to make his uniform wet, so he turned to a more reliable tactic - "a good cop negotiated".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Mastership football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the graves to escape an alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired by natives to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins-Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end the race sport
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his cities last year and threatened to finish the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the Integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had carried out a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's Late Scratching due to a Wednesday's treatment, the last strawhole on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and he faced difficult conditions himself when it was about the positive cobalt topper test at Lidaris that he couldn't explain.
He had stayed for 18 months because of the espionage assumptions and did not want it "to look like too high grapes."
"I had nothing to say about it, and I've been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that it all comes out at once," said Moody.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go around the raised capital, and I want my owners to think I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I'm not doing this, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Previously Moody had let the bomb go up in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy out its stable.
"Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him a job in my seats to provide information about what I'm doing within my seats," Moody said on Racing.com.
You obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should certainly stick to their noses because they refused to touch me when they tried to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former President of the RVL, David Moodie, President of the RVL and Bernard Sandry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this and are still today.
Should that make me think it's going to be personal?
Did the RVL behave cowardly and perhaps make people out of coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think I am.
Maybe they have to take my license and break me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying is that she's letting her think about it now.
But I've come to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and force them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustration level of the coach has been built up with the long ongoing cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late Scratching led him to say that he could "put his license on the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unbeatable Master Black Caviar, called the racing treatment rule "laughing", after a pack of mud or sound was placed on the horses' legs, which contradicted the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my employees has mistakenly slammed on the leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been like yesterday all day, whatever it was.
But it was the same on the day of the race.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disability for treatment with packaging on the day of the week. An investigation of this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who set up these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here you have gone too far," said Moody.
Man arrested after a driver's flight
At the weekend, the police arrested a man after a collision with a biker and later a driver in Cobram.
The biker was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley motorway.
The police said the driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia was appointed to the police in Shepparton.
It is expected that it will be charged for driving and for missing assistance and for other traffic offences.
The biker, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in the hospital. He is in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy fights against rivals because of claims to ring fights
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has described criticism at the hacking of his players as "Agenda setting" by two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters Trainer Trent Robinson said that the referees allowed the storm players "ring fights" with his team during the high storm victory at the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a hardly hidden remark to the storm team after his team had won the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening. He called the game a "pattern example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended the tacklime of his team and said that they were focused only on their "contact" during the tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers on his team was likely to vote for him, as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the storm team.
"It always turns out - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about ring fights when they beat us 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything to our defensive system or techniques all year round. But in the last six weeks, we have made our contact at Tackles a real focus, and this has brought us the trendy.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he's probably not used to losing it, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It's already funny how this happens again and again at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennetts' idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetts St George Illawarra Dragons won the 2010 Premier League with "long-term" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night to our Friday night and how exciting her game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticised as a boring team, and Wayne said he'd take care of a shit.
But now he has a team that can play and that we view as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
That's the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like this.
I build more confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when it came to Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. Roosters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos vs. Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are pauses and no points exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
When they mention us, it means that we're still going to meet them in one phase.
The storm team is free to receive on this weekend, as they have won the right, either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday evening at the pre-final in AAMI Park.
Serbia with $200,000 bail on drug charges
A man who may be threatened by a lifelong penalty because of his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine that were smuggled to Queensland was released against a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month, after the federal police found 100 kg of drugs on the Yacht Solay, who came from South America over Vanuatu and set up in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was observed as he met his fellow prisoners in the yacht in the morning and later in the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possible lifelong penalty for attempting to own a commercial quantity of cocaine, the lawyer at Maximovic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole quantity and that it could have been for a reason of shame in the café.
The judge of the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of flight at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the case of the crime, he denied the police about his place of residence.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather had offered a deposit of $200,000 as security together to reach its release.
"After reading the two people's own statements, it is clear that the imposition of a security of $200,000 is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against bail, under the conditions that he gave his Australian and Serbian passport, reported to the police daily and held a starting barrier from 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 at Karlsruhe: Guidehouse travels apart
In the case of a three-car accident on the 5th motorway at Karlsruhe, a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday night.
Two of the three involved trucks had been braked in front of a permanent building in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed that it was too late and tried in vain to escape at the last moment to the left, as the police reported.
The driver's house of the accident triggers completely apart.
The driver was seriously injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for more than six hours to 2 hours.
There was a damage of EUR 122,000.
Steven Hogg's phone used by girls to lure paedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone when he slept, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a number of inappropriate images from children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She watched it through, found the confusing messages and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed the computers that were found under the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used the terms for looking for inappropriate images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officers that he had done it, as it would lead to "pedophile on the Internet" and then he "professed to be a police officer to frighten them".
State attorney Elidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be a search - that he was sick to scare people.
He added that the searches were carried out on the computer by him, but he said it was because he claimed to be a cop to scare paedophile.
He was asked after his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he was sick in his head when he was drinking, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was at the cemetery and the wine.
She also saw the inappropriate pictures on the phone and confronted the accused.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and Playstation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, guilty in the sense of the indictment, of having taken undue pictures of children on 14 June last year, of having violated the charges on 25 January of this year and not of having appeared before the court to a hearing on 24 March of this year.
Defendant lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, since one could argue that "no significant sexual element" was found in his past.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael removed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but due to hearings on other outstanding cases, it was kept under investigation.
He was registered before the date of the judgment in the register of sexual offenders.
Schleusers vary on small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being attacked at the German-Austrian border from behind the major checkpoints.
Many lockers were afraid to discover and arrest the people increased at smaller border crossings
on the Austrian side out, a spokesperson of the Federal Police said.
Over 1,000 refugees have been arrested since Tuesday in the Passau and Rottal-Inn districts.
They had reached the German side by foot over the bridges and muds.
There they are received by federal police officers and forwarded to registration.
At the Munich Main Station, after federal police reports, there were significantly more refugees in comparison to the start of the week on Wednesday.
By 8:00 a.m., about 700 people arrived in the capital city, a speaker said in the morning.
Following the re-introduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, on Tuesday 1759 refugees reached the city.
Stuttgart: Tours of the "Henry" Tropensturm in the south-west expected
Meteorologists warn against storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
The German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart, which is currently operating in hot sea air, reported to the country as a result of a deep pressure area across Western Europe.
The strong depth was the exit of the "Henry" tropical storm, which had been pulled over the Atlantic by the Bermuda Islands in the past days.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected mainly in Baden.
According to DWD, it is still to be calculated until Thursday morning in the Black Forest, on the Schwäbische Alb and in the ground season with boenas of 60 to 90 hours.
So on Friday, the sun can be reappeared.
The mass makes it: Every two years the autobuilder on the IAA shows their novelties.
2015 is mainly to be recorded in the compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly asked: around 28.1 percent of the new permits were issued by the KBA in August alone on this segment.
This is also reflected in the IAA (Public Day 17-27 September).
Between all futuristic vehicles and new top-class and luxury cars, many new compact models are presented this year in particular.
One of the biggest prizes for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be held in the autumn by the dealers.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel-Chief Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to be sold well, the new astra should not be much more expensive for it.
Opel represents an entry below the largest rival VW golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 litre motor with 74 kW/100 PS.
In addition, the Hessens offer additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 PS to 147 kW/200 PS, which are also first included in the Drenrylider gasoline.
Unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, there is the Opel Astra first only as a fifth driver.
The second variant will follow in the spring of the van, which is already visible on the IAA.
And what's going to happen to new compact cars next to the Astra on the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra-competitive Mégane into the race.
At the fair, the Meghane can only be seen as a fifth doorman in a conventional and accentuated sporty GT version.
He comes to trade at the beginning of next year, then also as a van.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is completely new in the segment.
The Nissan Ableger wants to find its position in the strong growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti fits fully with its narrow lines into the design line of the brand.
The base model will receive a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 PS.
In the offer there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 PS or 125 kW/170 PS.
Suzuki Baleno: The new segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premieres in Frankfurt.
The model with petrol engines is offered, including a newly developed 1.0 litre turbo engine and a power of 82 kW/111 PS.
The maximum torque is 170 Newtonmeter (Nm) according to manufacturer's specifications.
The sale of the Baleno in Europe is in the spring of 2016.
DS 4: Not quite new, but around it is the compact class model DS 4, which is visible on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble citroën-abeleger especially hand-held at the front: Here the cooler grill was redesigned and the modified light bulbs were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was mainly modernised, the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and first integrated Apples CarPlay.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants such as the updated Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are listed in the IAA compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are unmanufactured
The Federal Constitutional Court granted an ex-prison of the Tegel Court of Justice, which was held in a small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are essentially entitled to financial compensation when they are placed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, the victims can even hope for money if they were confined to the narrow spaces for a few days (Ag.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
This led to the success of a former prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was placed in a single cell with about five square meters of ground area at the Berlin-Teel Justice Centre between June and November 2009; the toilet was not spaced apart.
After that, the man who, according to his lawyer's statement, was now on a free footing, was placed in a larger cell.
His appeal for undeserved prison terms against the Land of Berlin was dismissed.
However, the Constitutional Court raised the judgment of the Court of Justice in Berlin and re-examined the case there.
You see the human dignity of the man injured.
Court of Justice now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, the period in question was only a few days long enough for the compensation, there was a claim for compensation, it was said.
Otherwise, "an advocate of the protection of the personality" would be afraid.
The Court of Justice must now clarify the amount of damages.
In the past, the Constitutional Courts have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
In April, they only spoke of a prison sentence because he was naked in a cell.
Humanity is also a decision of 2011 according to the multiple placement of a cell without separate toilets.
In addition, Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009.
The complainant was placed in a cell of the same type as Karlsruhe in three months per day between 15 and 21 hours per day.
The Berlin prisons have also come to the battle lines in the last few weeks because of missing personnel.
Prisoners are therefore constantly included for 23 hours, increasing aggressiveness, even in battles, because of the tense situation.
According to the Justice Press Office, 21 posts in brick are not occupied due to a lack of maturity, 19 will be lost in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the Refugee Policy: "We create it"
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What's going on in Germany?
About 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to Vice-Kanzler Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to accommodate a million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can create it, and we create it".
What is happening in Germany is the following overview.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 ( Estimation of the Federal Tree Ministry) and 400000 ( Estimation of the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - and the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as previously built (250000 apartments).
The lack of living space is dramatic, but especially in the case of affordable rental facilities: 60000 to 80000 social apartments fall out of the rental price bond each year, and refugees will apply for these particularly affordable apartments.
Federal Ministry of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding from the current 518 million to a billion euro.
Much too little is done from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80,000 social apartments had to be created annually and the feds had to invest a funding of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and the Federal Ministry agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
According to estimates from the Institute for Labour Market and Employment Research, 55 per cent of refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them when they entered, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, for the integration of refugees, it is crucial that they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, to value in society, but also to the self-esteem of immigrants, says Migrationssforcher Dietrich Tränhardt.
In Germany, according to Tränhardt, there has been a political change: from the ban on working for refugees to recognise work.
While there was a ban on employment for asylum seekers up to five years earlier, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residence requirement, which limited asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society - and also because of the introduction of skills - most people see that refugees should be made more accessible to the labour market more quickly.
There is a great need for access to the labour market, which is lacking in German knowledge.
So far, there is not enough provision for general and professional language courses.
Moreover, surveys show that jobs are most often communicated by personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore, in the view of Thränhardt the King's Way to Work Integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to Kitas, estimated 10 to 15 percent: "It is only once very important for the disappointed parents to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of the Kita, the administration distributes handsets in different languages.
If the need for educators by the large number of refugees rose strongly, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example by allowing more specialized schools.
In the countries, students without German knowledge in welcome classes are prepared for teaching.
However, they will not always be taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a secondary language.
They do not lack, says Beate Substances from the Berlin School Administration.
The German Student Office estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no federal state of asylum or patient prohibits the study - the only exception has so far been Berlin, Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his position.
Student refugees could be facilitated access to the university.
Because refugees with a residence permit or cancellation will no longer receive benefits under the Act of asylum-seekers when they start a study.
The latter do not, in principle, receive a bribe as they do not fall within the circle of the eligible persons.
Patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for up to four years to be Bafag-authorised, from 1 January 2016 this band will be reduced to 15 months.
However, these financing losses also need to be closed, Steffen Krach, the State Secretary for Science of Berlin, and the German Student Office.
The students should be given abstinence immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The State should successfully deprive Islam of the same rights as they have the churches, and further develop the existing State-Church law into a new state-religious relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association, which professionally cares for the new arrivals.
The rights also include obligations.
In this way, the representatives of Islam must agree to clear contact partners and be prepared to cooperate with the State in many areas and provide him with certain control options.
This also includes the readiness to take a stand against religious fundamentalism.
The President of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday, religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany.
Those who wanted to austere such conflicts in Germany "have immediately their right to live here, in Germany," he said in the Bavarian radio.
He proposed to translate the basic law into Arabic.
Integration will be much more than today as a topic of society as a whole.
In order to change the majority society too, the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more pressing.
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti-discrimination centre and a general equality law for a decade.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and non-white German interest groups have long called for and what international agreements like the Anti-racism Convention Germany are committed to, must become reality in the coming years when the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany has been able to provide medical care for the refugees that have been expected, says medical President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As for man-power and capacity, let's do this," he said to the day-to-day mirror.
However, additional money had to be flown into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery calls on all arrivals to issue health cards at the same time as registration.
The benefits provided could later be calculated with the federal countries.
And in the long term, it would be most interesting to feed so many people with the limited catalogue of services provided by the Asylum Competition Act.
On the other hand, doctors tend to create language barriers.
Until now, as the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has proved, migrants are worse informed about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practice, she asks for interpreters to be taken over.
Many refugees would also have been helped with more general medical procedures in emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic look.
In refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and in young people it is HIV-declaration.
But with the other disease images, German doctors come out of their training clearly, says Montgomery.
"Parasite seizure or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And as for the medical shortage, it is possible that the refugees will even be able to heal in sight.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, some refugees were even doctors.
In order to be able to practice, however, they had to prove their qualifications and perhaps carry out further tests.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill, according to estimates of the Federal Psychotherapy Chamber (BPtK): most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
He is particularly vulnerable to refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, president of BPtK.
A recently published study by TU Munich shows that every five Syrian refugee children are traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from a post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from, among other things, so-called flashbacks with breath, dizziness, heart rate and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, strong fearlessness and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from being chronic, early treatment was necessary, Munz explained.
To date, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although psychologically ill asylum seekers in the social offices can apply for a psychotherapy, the treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, most professionals or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether or not therapy is necessary.
This often leads to miscalculations, says Munz.
Many invite to dream
With the new stage "Leadness", Circus Probst returns to the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to attract each age group into the bond of fascinating acrobatics, animal accessories and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites to the manage on the brick washed to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior chief.
"Leadness" - under this motto is the current man-made scene.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
The gift of enthusiasm is therefore in the blood of the family.
"It is important to get people out of their daily struggle and take them into a completely different world for two hours," says 27-year-old Junior Chief.
"Manegen cocktail with World City-Flair," says Director Reinhard Probst.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000 km long tour can now experience this flair.
The circus program convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family draws the audience with jokes and charms.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their work.
With the heroes of the stupid movies, it wants to take the Cuban duo loosely.
Lightness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art on the mast is to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
Except for numerous salmon salads, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with fingertip feeling and tenderness.
Balancing with the bike on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
The snakes fascinate and scare at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as few others and fascinates with their mobility.
60 Employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," says Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Mistakes in the treatment of circuses are only too often the subject of various animal protection organisations.
Stephanie Probst also takes the position: "If it's not good for our animals, it's not good for us either."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit.
The "four-end artists", as they are affectionately called, will be read from the eyes as possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to be in the mane.
So the highest order: take good care of the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPonyhangst and a zebrastute, the family Probst is proud.
The two animals have been together for eight years and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the mane, but it is the unique mask of the Circus Probst.
So there should be something for every visitor.
"One is safe," says Stephanie Probst: "whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always give our best and are with all our heart".
Circus Probst invites you to his performances every day from September 17th to September 20th.
On Sunday the program begins at 11 and 16 p.m.
Thursday is a family day, prices are reduced for the show at 5:00.
In addition, the animal show is open every day from 10 to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe holds false talks in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year from a podium.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case spread rapidly over the social media.
The opening up of Parliament was also shaken by statements by the opposition's Members that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's address with drills.
Last month they had built him up and interrupted him during his speech to the position of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to disrupt Mr. Mugabe's address.
"The message comes from a number that will not be displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he said after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity will end in Parliament, and once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective.
The chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "anxious" about the dangers for politicians.
Hewlett package will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the framework of restructuring and rescue efforts in the company's services.
HP will later split into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast-growing company hardware and its services business.
The expected decommissioning leads to a charge of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, said HP in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger focus than it is today, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better equipped than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion of annual turnover and "will be concentrated on providing unsuccessful integrated technology solutions for companies so far," said a statement by the company.
It separates a company that was founded in the 1930s by students at Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical installations and whose Palo Alto Garage was named "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone massive restructuring to manage the diversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure of HP, the world's second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US technology companies, is the latest in this area, which is based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance.
FC Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand behind the wounded Jack Wilshere before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Werner stressed to Wilsher that it was only September and that if his rehabilitation went according to plan, there was no reason why he could not play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilsher will probably miss at least the next four games for England, and in view of his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The big damage to this current problem is that Wilsher had ended the last season after a separate bone injury and had then returned to his old swing during the preseason.
"This kind of injury does not threaten your career," said Wenger.
It's a bone that doesn't heal well.
That's not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his bones or to the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also recognized, there is the associated danger of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The study of Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wilsher since his debut six years ago.
He also played in just 65 of Arsenals 157 league games in the last five games.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight games since 2007/08, most of which have to record.
We don't accept the potential of a devil circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes, when you get back from an injury, you have an offensive period, a time when you have to strengthen your body and win the fighting force," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to overcome it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm confident he'll do it and he'll go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger will set up a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey are not travelling to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wegener can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Montreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and the players who need it to take a little break," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to move on through Group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most fearsome playgrounds in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeatable after 41 games after the "unavoidable" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the court scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wegener believes that Arsenal has attracted the teaching of last season with the Champions League Capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading his management to his first European-Pokal triumph.
"This drive is huge," said Wenger.
It never hit Arsenal.
We were very close to this in 2006, but on the other hand, I am long enough in the business to be realistic.
We're jealous, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the Comedy show that really gives us lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar representations in Shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up, now even more desperate than ever before, how suicide killings among young men prove at a 15-year-old height.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death for men aged 20 to 45 in Britain, and it remains three times more common for men than for women.
In an effort to address the problem, the campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM campaign against a miserable life) announced 2015 as the year of man, with the goal of questioning culture that prevents men from looking for help if they need it.
Friendship is the heartpiece in the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A current study in more than 2,000 high-school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "stupid mood", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of spiritually healthy friends half the risks of mental problems.
But of course, you need to have friends just once so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media communication, with its focus on substance-style, the immediate response is often more important than a significant contact.
Our digital lives have the need to appear, strong, life-threatening and successful, doubled, even though in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extreme values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that has a far deeper impact on our spiritual health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money cannot really buy.
The beauty of friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which shined through the interaction as a friend.
The humour of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments of footballing in cozy sessions and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can relate to it at any time, even though they often refrain from fully discovering their feelings.
As an employee of the phone company told me: "My role in listening to people who are depressed and in danger of suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old speech "I am right about it" has an enormous effect, like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems openly."
Friends are one of the shows that makes sense to me when I try to offer longer-term management mechanisms.
It presents clearly the small moments of men's friendships.
As much as my objective external status over the phone can also help people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so if you visit this weekend's Comedy Central FriendsFest with the completely redesigned scenes for the celebration of the day, why not bring your friends to a drink in the Central Perk.
Or, even better if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG destroy Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his encounter with Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut at the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to cross Malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani took a course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League Season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Debüts as a PSG player who led the French champion, but then they missed a series of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cavani achieved a top baller in the 61th minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish masters, as they are not only seeking the qualification for the K.O. rounds, but an improvement on the way to the fourth finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, there was no class game by Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of the gate. He was later replaced in the game against his home city team and the association with which he started his illustrative career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or outside in the Champions League. So it's a good start to win 2:0, to cause our opponents problems and to relax, even though there are certain things that we still need to perfect during the season," Blanc said.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we haven't reached one or two more doors yet."
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury to one of three changes to the Paris team, which on the weekend was able to keep a 2:2 undecided on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League, but he was kicked out by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine bird storm was described as the man who can take the PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United, and he pointed out why when he entered the Marco Verrattis pass behind the Malmö defense before passing through Johan Wiland in the long corner of the network.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, it was disappointed.
Malmö, who hit Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, attacked Anpiff with nine national players in the field and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field a severe opponent.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who was far away from Kevin Trapps Pposten in the 34th minute pass, they offered little in attack.
Instead, the PSG himself sometimes came up with some flaws and bad conclusions, not least by Ibrahimovic, who was put into the first half of the trial and then abandoned after Cavani had used it after restarting it.
Nevertheless, he proved much more fit when he brought his fellows into the game, and it was a pass of Ibrahimovic, whom Di Maria turned into a turn shot, which was passed by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the foot ...
The second gate finally fell shortly after the hour-mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan achieved its sixth seasoner, after Ibrahimovic had fished a left flag of Maxwell.
This ended up thinking that Malmö could get back into the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the outcome low before replacement player Ezequiel Lavezi was opened a gate at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later added that the PSG played a class on his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
Qualification games are not enough."
Get out of Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion through stock sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, which is affected by rising raw materials prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt recovery plan.
The company registered in London Glencore said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is fighting falling commodity prices, as China's economic downturn pushes demand and has a devastating impact on markets.
The issue of rights of reference introduced Glencore's stock exchange rate at the end of the London Stock Exchange in the early Wednesday morning.
The share jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 Pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had announced last week the $2.5 billion share sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to spend around one third of his $30 billion debts.
The company sold the new shares to 125 Pence per share, which meant a 2.4 per cent discount on the final course on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term hidden growth in China have reduced iron prices by about half, coal, copper and other raw materials prices have decreased by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar

White House Confirms Xi Jinpings Visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xis first official in Washington, takes place on September 25th and refers President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the state said.
This evening, US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also be hosts of Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner after the two leaders have held bilateral talks.
"President Xis' visit will offer the opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to address constructively areas of opinion differences," the statement added.
XI, whose visit was announced first in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington before he goes to New York City to attend the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about alleged cyber spying in China and its increasing self-consciousness in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.

Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 Change to FC Bayern
World and European Master Xavi has been playing since summer 2015 for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar
The FC Bayern was apparently a few years ago shortly before the commitment of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight times Spanish champions, three times Pocal winner, four times Champions League winner, two times club world champions, two times European champions, one time world champion - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In the summer, the 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sports Club to Qatar.
But in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now betrays that he was already in front of the EM 2008 divorce from Barcelona.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything at the time, we won nothing," he says.
And that's what FC Bayern recorded.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern."
"Rummengge wanted me."
To remember: In the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
But the change didn't stop.
And the striking man today works for the German recordmaster: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça took Guardiola under contract and I played a great EM."
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's what he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's game period 2008/2009 would have run with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca at the final quarter of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the race, turned off the red (4:0, 1:1) and finally celebrated the Royal Class Triumph.
Matt Damon plays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted the African American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she would not be needed behind the scenes.
During a follow-up of Sunday Night by HBOs Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown was interrupted when she stressed the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the selected spinbook of the project.
"If we talk about diversity, then do it when you film and not when you play the show," said Damon.
Brown responded shockedly, with malicious disbelief and called "Hoo! Wow. Okay", when the artist's comments of The Martian got stuck.
Damon and Brown joined Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I want to invite people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how they treat the figure of the Harmony," Brown said first.
The only black person, and she is a utility that is hit by her white holder.
The producer of Dear White People took part in the film for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the director's rights; Damon pointed out that their director "could end up giving us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded before misconception about Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr. Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain her diversity - that's SO WEISS that it hurts".
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon's comments come at a time when the precise racial representation in the media is at the top of the social debate.
After the Teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved national effect and forced legislators and authorities to offer discriminatory practices against colour content.
In February, the singer Prince made a play on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter", he said (Albums still have their meaning).
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
In recent times, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement that, in response to the question of the Fox-News personality, Elizabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be viewed as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," said the leaders.
Recently it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media agents who will be invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the pope is unclear.
"American Ninja Warrior" won the first champion
Isaac Caldiero was the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the big price of $1 million home.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of its obstacle course.
During the season's finals, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten made it to the finals.
The last task was to climb a 75-foot climbing line in 30 seconds.
Britain completed the task within the time when he was the first athlete to complete phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero ended this challenge three seconds faster, making him a winner.
Caldiero spoke with E!News after the hard win, still under shock over the profits of the Great Price of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live," Isaac E! said about his Haupe money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine, as it is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed agreed with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, although he was the first to complete the course, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there's more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, it gets the great gratification.
I don't think he's talking about any of this.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
Lots of awards he received from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had changed their roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eight staff, the rotation work will begin in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneaking through Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
Once they were one of the best teams in Baseball, today the tigers are in the last place in the American League Central.
The tigers were reduced to their role as spies, but on Tuesday this part played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance to rise within a half of Houston Astro's game for the second American League Wildcard Square.
For Detroit, even for one evening only, it was a return of the three letters F-word, which was so difficult to capture over a large part of the second half of the season.
"Every victory makes fun, no matter how it comes," said Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitch Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) turned 6 times into the 1/3 innings and enabled three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine parties.
"I want to end this year strongly," said Simon.
It's hard to throw every game in the bubble, and that's why I want to focus on the game.
The designated Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He snooped the wood well," said Ausmus.
He looked good at the (schleg training), looked significantly better at the bullpen, and he brought it directly into the game.
With three rounds in the background meeting at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Field Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left line.
Right Field Aaron Hicks reached a stick, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to strikeout before he was replaced by the left-hand Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived Mauer, the only man with whom he was confronted, in front of the designed Rookie-Schlagmann Miguel Sano, who the right-hand Drew Verhagen a two-run entriss.
With a couple of runners and the final run at the second pleasure, the third baseman Trevor led to a double play.
It was the leader of the Major League 27th time this season that Ploughs hit a Double Play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Waller created an RBI double against the tiger's castle Bruce Rondon and reached the state of 5-4.
However, the right-hand man ran out of Sano with three pizzas for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from an unmoved Phil Hughes.
The tigers scored three rounds in the first two innings against the right-hand veteran, who was cut off from the injured list in front of the game after missing more than one month due to a rear line.
"Of course not the beginning that I wanted," Hughes said, "but I felt better when I released and felt that I would create some pretty good pizzas there in the third inning."
After they first received the leadoff boat, Hushes gave up a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, which created a single "up the middle" during the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 success series with the runners in the score position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third, which ended the threat.
The tigers added in the second, a One-Out Double of Catcher James McCann and a Two-Out Single of Center-Field Anthony Gose achieved a 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins Manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got the right place.
Hughes was in a Pitch-Count, achieved no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reliever Right Hands A.J. Afterer.
At Hughes it came to three runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was separated due to an injury to the fire shield.
He is being investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injured list due to a shoulder injury, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez from the game, LHP Daniel Morris will be removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starters with the tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30th.
He has been missing since 20 August due to a collapse in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and Twins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees to live in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people involved are then to be accommodated in emergency accommodations in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday.
It counted with 450 to 750 arriving refugees.
Several sportsmen in the Hessian capital were prepared in the past days for this case.
Up to 1,000 refugees can be temporarily displaced there.
They should then be further distributed to other municipalities.
In the past ten days alone, 7,500 people have arrived in Hessen, according to the Government Bureau responsible for the first admission.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in Sportallen because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The Head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military action with German participation in Syria an opportunity.
"I believe that the determined thought of military action options must not take place without Germany," he said.
He proposed to the European States 'collective views'.
Four years ago, it was a joy that the Kelch of military participation in Germany had passed.
"Now the conflict lands in front of our house door," he said in German radio.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive rise in international aid on site for refugees.
Austria controlled at the southern and eastern borders
According to Germany, Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner explained on Tuesday in the Austrian TV station ORF, no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Even Germany did not send refugees back to Austria.
"No, this is so agreed," she explained.
On the question of an agreement, after which Germany could accept a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been talks between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not call concrete numbers and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria through the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Its aim is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU Heads of State and Government, applied for a special summit next week.
Germany had started temporary border checks on Sunday.
The EU has not yet been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
On Tuesday (September 22nd) at a special meeting, the EU Home Minister wants to take a new call for the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees.
In view of the strong refugee campaign in Germany, the federation wants to support the countries more strongly in the first generation and distribution of people.
The Federation will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced on the last Tuesday after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Minister at the Berlin Office.
Merkel stressed that those people who need protection also fight them.
But those who do not have a living perspective cannot stay in Germany either.
This view was expressly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now had to cope with a "risk force effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are currently on the Balkan route.
On Tuesday night, Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia.
A few hours later, the government announced in Budapest that the border to Romania was also bordered with a tooth.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU other than Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent Schlepper from seeking out routes across Romania, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said to the planned new border crossing.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
In Turkey, according to eye sample reports, thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border.
Space probe "Cassini" finds Ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the icepan of Saturn Mond Enceladus, a global ocean floats.
That concludes researchers from observations of the space probe "Cassini".
Thus the moon slightly fades on its orbit around the ring planets.
Although this thumb movement is only small, yet too large for a continuous fixed body of heaven, it is called in a message from the Cornell University of Ithaca, New York, from Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the "Icarus" section.
Long ago it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
Thus "Cassini" had already discovered 2006 ice volcanos at the south pole of Saturn moon, feeding water vapours and ice particles and thus feeding the so-called E-ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole there must be a subterranean sea, the astronomers closed at that time.
However, the extension of the hidden ocean was not explained.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to give up about a month on the offensive agent Valdet Rama.
An investigation revealed an adductor injury at the age of 27, the association informed.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Munich Löwen, the diagnosis means "probably four weeks of forced retirement".
"That's hard for us, Rama is a bitter loss."
"Of course, we need to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "image" section with a view to the possible commitment of a unified profession.
As a training guest, however, the Sixies first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
Croatia currently has "the opportunity to demonstrate its ability".
Torjäger Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his brain injury.
Already on Thursday, the Austrian national player will be on the run.
Okotie had injured herself in the party at Fortune Düsseldorf (0:3) in a severe crash on her head.
In contrast to the first fears, however, he remained without a serious blessing.
No diet fruit - Mangos contains much sugar
Mangos are exotic and juicy.
But whoever wants to look at his slender line, it will be more often taken away from them.
Because mangos contain relatively much sugar - mainly sucrose.
The exotic fruits, however, are healthy: they contain B vitamins and vitamins E and C. However, Mangos contains a lot of vitamin A and its pre-stage beta-carotene.
Therefore, those who eat the fruit support visual, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying Mangos should not be too soft or stiff and smoke pleasantly.
The shell color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangos can also taste very pleasant.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within less days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or sweet food.
A mango, however, also gives a special note to the Courts of Heart.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and wild.
The U.S. Package Service provides up to 95,000 grants for Christmas business in the United States.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS informed on Tuesday.
In particular, drivers are being searched.
As of last year, UPS had set up its staff for the holiday season by 95,000 aid.
Given the booming online business, UPS and its rival FedEx have made arrangements to be equipped for Christmas business since last year.
In 2013, late deliveries introduced the package services with harsh criticism.
First Féhnsturm, then marked cold front
In the coming night, in the valleys of the north-north side of the Föhn, the Föhn breaks through, as Meteoshweiz reported on Tuesday.
On Wednesdays and at night on Thursdays, the pheasant partially blows through the pheasants.
After arriving on Thursday morning, we cross a spectacular cold front that brings strong rainfalls, winds and a temperature drop.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front side of an extensive underground area over the British islands in a strong southwestern stream.
On the Alpennor side, at night, the föhn breaks through the valleys on Wednesday.
As a result, the Föhn to Thursday morning blows into the Föhntällen with boenas from 60 to 100 km/h, individually and in particular in the Urnerland, with more than 100 km/h.
The föhn can, by the way, advance to the neighbouring Mediterranean country, and even Orcanoes over 120 km/h are possible on the mountains.
While in the north on the Wednesday of stormy ovens provide summer temperatures of 23-27 degrees, the humidity begins to grow at the mountain slope.
Here is where rain stops until Thursday night.
In total, the Alps have to be calculated in the south in the next 48 hours with partially over 100 litres of rain per square metre, after which large amounts of rain have fallen in the last days.
On Thursday morning, the air goes out to the fan, resulting in a cold front with strong, partially violent rain from West to East over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind cools strongly until stormy, and the temperatures go back clearly.
The following days are presented in the north by 15 to 20 degrees in the south, on the other hand it will be sunny and warmer by up to 25 degrees in the weekend.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the reform, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of President Ignazio Marino, a nameless place in the park was baptized on Wednesday at the Oppio hill on behalf of the German reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Luthero" he is now regarded as "German Theology of Reform".
The park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The name was applied for by the working community of the Evangelical Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the popes over the centuries were often able to live their faith as a minority only in hiding.
The place will symbolically show that their tradition of Christian belief in Rome was welcome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) was a young Augustinermöch in Rome during the 1510/11 season.
He received the city at that time as a guilty sinner.
His negative impressions may have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome in the eyes of historians.
Luther then began the division of the church in the evening with his thesis against abortion.
Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) crown is one of the main works Otmar Old painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
Was that the word at first?
No, not at the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which now appears with magnificent images.
At first, the image of Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his entire personal interpretation of Bible stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colourful colors and fantastic shapes has been received by the 75-year-olds - but it is not the same with "stupid" images.
On the contrary: adapted to the subject in question, it can seem quite dark.
About three years ago, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he met a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the "Book of All Books".
Cycles have been created that focus on issues such as crossroads, plagues, commandments or fathers' cousins.
As a result, he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther publishing with his theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing with his focus on art books.
And there is, above all, the author Klaus Altepost, who, on the basis of the painting, has intertwined with the respective Bible sites.
He interpreted the Bible sites chosen by Otmar Old and thus translated into today, in current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting.
They are incorporated between Martin Luther's original bibelzitat and each of them a set of artists, who here formulates his very personal thoughts about the situation.
The jewelry belt has golden letters.
Thus the 75-year-old equally doubles a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Finally, emotions were triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant orders of the Lord.
"The education was already done with the pipestock," recalls Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to work this out so that I may also be in agreement with the Lord Father again."
His second concern was to help art in a fast-paced time to revalue: "The perception of image worlds is today marked by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolism is being forced.
Artists have another desire and passion to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "infect" into the images, let them affect themselves, discover and sense what force they have: "The image is looking for against it".
Klaus Altepost was present on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bible in the Otmar-Alt Foundation, "always" being a lover of Otmar-Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Old people did not pay attention to fully grasping the Bible, but they chose important, even mysterious, topics for it.
"It was not cooperation on eye height," Altepost says, "this is about the images that the text only explains."
For Hans Möhler of Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "increasing his life and finding freedom".
Otmar Alts pictures speak for Möhler both the (bible) language of love and the responsibility.
Part of the original - paper and canvas paintings - is presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Otmar-Alt Foundation.
Beginning of construction for BMX track closes
Plans made, space found, company commissioned, helicopter modelled for a round course: A year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX track was finished again.
Political and administrative failures caused confusion, especially among the inhabitants who did not want the railways.
So the hills were cut off, looking for a new place - now with formal planning and application for construction approval.
The approval will take place in October, the first municipality of Sabine Mosbach-Bock was now able to notify the Committee on Children and Youth.
"I hope this year is still visible," she said.
It should then be started without "wider memory break" with the work of the former bathroom.
DFB intensified engagement for refugees
The DFB expands its commitment to refugees by 2019, the Bundesliga sets a clear sign at the weekend.
The football will respond to the situation in Germany and the policy will ensure its help in dealing with the problems ahead.
"I consider this to be the biggest challenge of our country since the reunification."
"No one in principle can say that I'm not doing anything, I have nothing to do with it."
"This must interest every individual to get this issue into the grip," said DFB Chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At an annual meeting with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I'm in the office next Wednesday, and there I meet the Minister of State Mrs Özoğuz and the Chancellor."
"There will certainly be a central role for the issue," he announced.
The football can and will help.
The decisive flaws, however, must be the policy.
The German Football League has therefore extended its "1:0 for a welcome" initiative for four years.
"On the Egidius-Brown Foundation we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," Niersbach said on the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
A number of federalists also support this programme.
Already this weekend, the 36 Profivereines have a clear sign when they bear the impression "We help - #refugeeswelcome" instead of the other usual sponsor logo (hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help, where and how only they can," said Leverkusen Sports Manager Rudi Völler of the "Image" section (Tuesday) and described the project as "self-understanding".
"The Refugee Drama is everybody's going, nobody's going to get away."
"We can, no, we need to use our radiation power, our influence and our opportunities to help many refugees who have suffered so incrediblely," said Hertha-Manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's Managing Director Peter Justig spoke of a "prominent sign of the League".
For the EM qualification game against Hungary this Friday, the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Hall/Saale.
Niersbach referred to the support of refugees as "a great community of German football".
That all 36 Licensing Associations had started their own projects in their places, it was great.
It's just as great that small and smallest associations are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome", which we have issued, is live in football.
"That is of enormous importance," he said.
This year and the next year, the Association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, will provide EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees.
"The associations have already collected the entire sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in the event of an accident
The CEO of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, has lost his left eye, according to several reports by a storm in early July.
In the case of an accident at his brother's house in the United States, he fell on a glass of water after midnight, which he carried in his left hand, reported the "Employment Week" on Wednesday.
"He's almost bleeding, he was powerless, then he slipped out on the street - that's what he told us last week," says the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could follow his work.
"In early October we will meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully working".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutschen Zeitung" (Süddeutschen Zeitung), in October he will return to Germany and lead the software groups further.
"I'm full of SAP there, full of my job."
"Of course, I have been in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," said McDermott of the "SZ".
McDermott usually lasts between Germany and the USA, but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP centre in Walldorf.
To him it was important to go to the public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Everyone can do something like this."
"It's important to get up again if you fall."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen except fight ...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and explained that he had suffered the injury when he was injured by the wheel.
So he comes in the evenings in Singapore on the weekend as little as a reserve leader for the two tribal pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as one week later at the Japan Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without giants against Krasnodar: Winter fields in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund all hopes for a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken down.
The national player will also miss the table leader of the football league in duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19:00/Sky).
"We can't take it back," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be on Sunday at the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen again, the BVB coach opened: "We expect him to return to training on Friday".
Given the high load of his profession, Tuchel will not only change his tribe on the giant position.
So he announced a change in the Torhüter position.
This is why Roman Weidenfelder takes the place of the tribekeeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains on an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
However, if weedfields are to be used in all European League games in the future, Tuchel opened up.
He'll probably fight the second party too.
The research statement by fellow players Reus that the final entry for the BVB in Europe League must be the goal, says middle-field player Julian Weigl: "Marco is not so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance to take the title off."
Robote cars: Government wants a leading role for Germany
Germany is expected to be a technological pioneer in the process of changing the car after the will of the Federal Government.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet decided a strategy paper from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA car fair from a "new mobility timer".
The automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and provide for less noise, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G7 States, who also meet with representatives of industry on the IAA.
The Ministry of Transport's strategy paper highlights, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband development and a rapid rise in digital radio broadcasting.
In order to test new techniques, a test line is currently in place on the 9th motorway in Bavaria.
In order for the driver to be "no additional liability risks", the Federal Government wants to "check the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
Thus, Germany intends to make an international effort to increase the maximum permissible speed for self-propelled cars from 10 to 130 kilometres.
The Federal Government also wants to make use of an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car will increasingly take the driving, the driver will become more and more for the passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data quickly in seconds.
After a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, high-automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, unmanned vehicles on public roads are "to be expected long after 2020".
The value added in the field of driving assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany is estimated by the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital networking of the Pkws can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport," said SPD traffic politician Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the driver must be clearly clarified.
Even the Germans see self-driving cars, however, skeptical - much more than French or American.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the Decra inspection organisation presented on Wednesday at the AA results that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will be implemented in the next ten years, 32 percent only in 20 years so that 31 percent do not believe in it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents are driving cars by 2025, 33 percent in the USA.
Nevertheless, the drivers in Germany are not ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
After a survey of the Bitkom Digital Association, only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the entire journey on all roads.
On the highway, this could be represented by 15 percent in the ongoing traffic, 45 percent in the stau.
Well, every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances.
Boll quits team and double start at table tennis-EM
The Düsseldorfer wants to strike in detail in the title battles from September 25th to October 4.
The final decision shall take place at the latest on 22 September.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys have learned it in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on the flight to a long-term agreed sponsoring term in China at that time.
The 34-year-old German master is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo, the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favorite," said single European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the set list in Jekaterinburg, also recalled the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"Timo also missed at the time, and we became European champions."
"Daran should guide us," explained the World rankings.
The English football national player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to the right leg.
At the Champions League game at the PSV Eindhoven, the defender was met at a touch of Héctor Moreno and was replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated a break in the neck of the 20-year-old team of Bastian Schweinsteiger.
Gaultier feels too old for a child terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figure-grass cabinet: designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The high points: the showcase dolls, which thanks to video projections look horribly human.
They bring the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the big star of fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and that he put men in Röcke.
"I can't say today that I'm the child terrible of the skin couture because I have white hair."
"Before it was lighted, in the meantime it is real," said Gaultier.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (from the citizens' ladder to the race), which is to be seen in the art hall of the Hypo-Cultural Foundation from September 18th, it is a lucky thing that the fashion designer has at first changed his negative attitude to a show about his person.
Actually, he was on the other side, because, "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.
When you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station.
"It's so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the man's hardly to be seen yet, the fashion story has written without ever having completed a training.
Chronologically, the show is not built up, but it is an excellent choreographed work of art, for which much effort has been made: for example, a stylist was engaged to refresh the dolls.
14 tons of material have been driven by the makers according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the October festival, there was a special hammock: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women (“Women are tougher than men”) and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old Teddy is also at the exhibition.
It stands for the first, masterful fashion experiments of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad at football) he wore his Teddy BHs and clothes, Gaultier said.
To play with a doll, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
The design of fashion he later joined himself.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later, though, I bought it, of course.
For his first fashion show he couldn't pay the models.
They didn't get anything, but they could keep the stickers.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener tipze as fashion niches
Earlier it went to the long stick machines and to make a meter.
The solids and peaks were created in large quantities for customers who, for example, further processed to roofs and gardens.
That alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of Fashionspitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauener Spitze mode played a larger role, then was forced by the home textile industry - and is now discovered as a niche.
Reinhardt mentions several examples: tops in jewelry, accessories such as pockets and regional costumes.
At all, the so-called vintage mode, which lends itself to past style pockets, is an increasing contract potential.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make half of all the orders.
Modespitze Plauen is a member of the Plauener Spitze and Stickerie industry association with nine other companies.
Only they can wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of the turnover has been cut off.
Private trades and even wholesale trade are almost no longer available.
Our products are barely reaching customers this way.
The mass goods are now much cheaper in the Asian space and are almost exclusively sold through chains.
In addition, exports, currently to Russia and to the United States, weaken.
So enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to point out through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of the Stick Pearl in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have been leading a quality seal, which shows that we are producing environmentally and socially acceptable".
Reinhardt adds: "This also applies to the materials used".
Graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger outdoors of the West Saxony University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in stickers and tips.
To counter competition from the Asian space, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a field of tension between the latest ideas of designers and the companies that have to think economically in particular," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design will often vary slightly just to keep a customer strain.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter relived the historical snowball tip.
The machine taps small balls in some places.
The Plauen goldsmither Bianca Hallebach-krauste was inspired by this: "Before, I couldn't start anything with traditional Plauener tip".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In a heavy procedure, she marks the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuters.
It also delivers to the United States, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose predecessors have lived in the plains and surroundings and who want a piece of memory.
That's how I view my beauty as a modern ambassador of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney planted a new Mary Poppins movie
You shouldn't touch legends, but Disney is still watching a new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins".
However, according to Entertainment Weekly, it is not about a new filming, but about a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical baby girl.
It's about the experiences of Nanny and the Banks family in times of the world economic crisis in England.
Whoever plays Poppins for more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already standing: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi insists to open the economy wider for the world
The economy needs to open more widely to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday a group that was commissioned to drive the reform.
"China should work towards attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving business-based strategies," he said in an address at the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group to deepen a comprehensive reform.
To promote new foundations and to advance reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide a new place for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of market access regimes, the relaxation of border control policies, the promotion of state enterprises (SMEs), private capital, and the overhaul of the population reporting system.
After the status is established, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and companies that are not in question for investment.
The system is tested from time to time and improved by test programs.
The initiative is important as it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensures a legal environment and opens up the market, the statement said.
The government will also ease checks on the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The state also said that China will be allowed to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open government-controlled sectors, further areas of private investment are open.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," the statement said.
Furthermore, it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to ensure the exercise of their activities and the appointment of professional judges and public prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also took part in the meeting, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double the value of mercury in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the thresholds for mercury in large ruminants and to give consumers a significantly higher dose of the neurotoxicity.
The Foodwatch Consumer Organisation, which has a corresponding EU working paper, strongly criticised the plans: "The risks and adverse effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are further addressed with full attention to pregnant and minors," said Matthias Wolfschmidt by Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shark or swordfish for "economic political reasons" are to be increased by one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
Large predatory fish are already so heavily loaded with mercury today that about 50 percent of the catches are not allowed to be sold on the basis of the existing limit values.
After double the limit values, only 14.5 per cent would be non-saleable.
In contrast, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to increase the limit values for other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, referred to this as "trick", because smaller fish, such as carpfs, are usually so low that they keep the planned maximums already today.
The decrease in small fish is therefore "a perfect decoupling manoeuvre that helps the economy alone," said Wolfschmidt.
Quecksilber is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which is highly enriched by the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
Therefore, the Federal Government warns that "almost few people can cause particular damage to the nervous system when they are born".
The Federal Ministry of the Environment, however, states on its homepage that there is no "health risk for the general population" to be expected.
Quecksilber is mainly due to carbon burning in the environment.
According to a written statement by the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal plants were awarded more than six tons of mercury per year, two thirds of the total volume issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, e.g. in Elbe, Rhein and Donau, was "permanently and superficially exceeded", the "species" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, European warnings against mercury in fish already included the most frequently reported health risks in the EU alert system RASFF.
