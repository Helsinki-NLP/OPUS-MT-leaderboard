Violent Members are worried that they will be confused with the "mapet"
Some Members expressed concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Parliament of the Netherlands).
This concern arose in relation to the plans to change the name of the Assembly of Parliament of Wales.
Members throughout the political spectrum are concerned that something like this will sound ridiculous.
A member of the Working Party said his resignation was concerned that "it would make him categorical with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers out of Wales: The word "twp" literally means "huge" and the word "pwp" means "lots".
A playwright said that the overall extension "was not satisfied" and proposed alternative solutions.
One Olyan conservative said his departure was "open" about the change of name, but noted that the word MWP does not leave much of the word "mapet".
In this context, the waal letter w is similar to the English phrase of Yorkshire in the letter u.
The Parliament's Committee, which is currently drawing up the bill for the adoption of a change of name, said: "The final decision on any name by which Members will be called will naturally be the case of the Members themselves."
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the Parliament of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, which were widely accepted for the name of the House as Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the title of the Members, the Commission was in favour of the term "Member of Parliament of the Netherlands" or WMP, but the choice of MWP was the one that gained greater support during the public consultation.
The Members are obviously proposing alternative options, but the attempt to reach consensus may be a difficult case for the President of Parliament, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the bill to change his name within the next few weeks.
The law on reforms will also include other changes in the way in which the House operates, including rules of derogation from the Member's office and the design of the committee system.
The Members will decide in the final vote on the question of their name during the legislative debate.
In the fields, the citizens of Macedonia come to the referendum on the change in the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday on the change of the country's name to "The Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The people's vote was called for in an effort to resolve a decade-long conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens claims that the name of the north is almost covered by territorial scarcity and has repeatedly been opposed to its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Georgie Ivanov, President of Macedonia, a war of referendum on the change of name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeif, claim that the change is just the price they have to pay for their EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's campaigns have gone down as the churches in Harlem disappear.
"The older people I spoke to say that there was a bar earlier and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
Today, there's none of the two."
He said he understood the reason the bars disappeared.
"The world is socializing differently today," he said.
"The bar is no longer the neighborhood salon where the world is regularly frequented."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the assets will not remain as long as the officials hope "and will return sooner or faster to the point where they started".
The churches, he added, can be replaced by multi-dwelling fillings with people who would not be willing to help the places of worship that have remained nearby.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and will therefore rush the day when all these churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that all these people who move to these apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white churches before the Harlem metropolis of Black - the Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original Methodist Church departed in the 1930s.
A black church located close to the site took possession of the building.
The possession of St. Martin’s building took up a black church under the archbishop John Howard Johnson, who went to the 125th Street boutique, a main trade route to Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but Father Johnson’s enorites took over the reconstruction and ordered the carione.
Dr David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's church, proudly called the "the campaigns of the poor".
The expert who played the cartoon in July described it in a slightly different way: "political treasure" and "an alternative instrument of historical importance".
The expert, Tiffany In, from the University of Michigan, also noted that he was the first black musician in the world, Dionysius A. Lind, who was transferred to the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr Merigueder said that St. Martin's church did not replace him.
What is happening in the last few months in St. Martin is a complex story between architects and workers, some of whom were taken from the church's people, and others from the point of view.
The leaders - the administrative body of power, which is made up of the people's leaders - sent a letter to the Council in July about their concerns that the mission "would be able to transfer the cost" to the body of rights, despite the fact that this had no involvement in the acquisition of the architects and workers sent by the church.
Some enerites have voiced condolences about the lack of transparency on the part of the target.
Charged 13-year-old sharks in California
Cancer attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during the landings for ice fishing in California, the first day of the ice age, according to the principles.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near the Bicon Beach in Ensinitis.
Chad Hamel on KSWB-TV told San Diego that he had made raids with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the cries of the child asking for help and approached a team to get him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just a cry of excitement because he got homeless, but then he realized he was calling out, "Something hit me!
Something's touched me!"
His whole key had been opened," Hamel observed when he got to the place where the boy was.
"I called everyone out of the water: 'There are sharks in the sea!' said Hamel.
The boy was transferred by air to Randy's Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is critical.
The species responsible for the attack remains unknown.
Sailor Larry Giles said in the type paper that the shark had been detected in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was considered not to belong to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim brings serious injuries to the upper part of the body.
The authorities banned access to the beach from Ponto Bis in Kasabland to Sumis in Ensinitis for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's projects exert pressure on the US art market
The Sainsbury's is measured with the Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams by placing artistic reefs similar to those of the multi-stationery, controlled by special staff.
In the context of the significant volume of the US cosmetic market, which is up to £2.8 billion, which continues to develop while sales of clothing and household items indicate a drop, the largest cosmetic reefs will be tested at 11 stores throughout the country and will spread to more shops if the surgery succeeds.
The investment in the arts comes as supermarkets search for a way to fill the space on the shelves that once understood televisions, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury's said they would double the size of their artistic offer to 3,000 products, including companies such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In the existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees there will also be more space with the company's logo, similar to those of shops like Boots.
The supermarket once again launches its own boutique makeup series so that most products are vegan - something that the younger consumers are asking for.
In addition, the fragrance company The Fragrance Shop will try to supply its products to two Sainsbury's shops, the one that opened in Croedon, South London, the previous week and the other in Shellie Oak, Bermiham, later this year.
The electronic markets and the trend in the market of small quantities of food daily at local retail markets mean that supermarkets should make greater efforts to make the world visit them.
Mike Coup, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the outlet stores would look more and more like the supermarkets, as the supermarket chains are trying to compete the Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more out-of-food services.
The Sainsbury's placed outlet Argos stores in hundreds of stores, while also imported certain Habitats as they bought both chains two years ago, a fact that supported sales of goods and made the sales more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reinstate the arts and pharmaceutical parts was unsuccessful.
The Sainsburys tried a partnership with the Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended after a dispute on how to distribute profits from pharmaceutical stores in the supermarkets of the chain.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury's sold the drug business you placed with 281 stores in Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, over £ 125 million three years ago.
He said Lloyds would play his own role in the project, adding an extended range of luxury care companies, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Miles-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our reefs to improve the environment for our consumers.
We also invested in specially trained personnel who would be available to offer advice.
The range of our companies has been designed to cover every need, while the attractive environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now a possible destination for the arts that question the traditional way of markets."
Peter Jones: An exception after Holly Willoby's departure from the 11 million-£ agreement
The winner of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, is brilliant after the departure of the Holly Willoby TV from the 11 million £ agreement with the lifestyle company he has to dedicate to the new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoby doesn't have time for the clothing and accessories company True.
Their company was similar to the Goop company in Guineth Paltrous.
The 37-year-old show show "This Morning" announced her decision to leave in Instagram.
Holly Willoby replaced the winner of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, by withdrawing from their winning lifestyle business at the last moment, in order to dedicate himself to its new huge symbols with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became furious when the golden girl of the TV was admitted during a full-length conference on Tuesday at the central offices of his empire in Marlow, in Bakighamsair, that because of the new symbols - up to £1.5 million - it would not have had enough time to be available in the company of clothing and accessories True.
The company was similar to the Goop of Guineth Paltrous and appears to double the property of Willoby, which is estimated to amount to £11 million.
After 37-year-old Willoby announced in Instagram that he was going to leave True, Jones flew out of Britain to some of his island dwellings.
According to one source, "Truly was far from the top priorities of Holly Willoby.
It was about its long-term future, its source of income for the next decades.
Her decision to leave surprised all those involved in the business.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the presentation.
There is a warehouse full of products in the central offices in Marlowo ready to be sold."
The experts estimate that the departure of the exhibition "This Morning", which is among the most commercial brands in Britain, could cost millions in the company due to the huge investment in products from handkerchiefs and candles to household clothing and clothing, as well as further delay in its presentation.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willoby, the mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin's wife have been in close friendship with Jones and Tara Cap's wife for ten years.
Willoby founded True with Cap in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined March as president.
Couples spend their holidays with him, and Jones keeps a 40 per cent share in Baldwin's television company.
Willoby is going to become the main person in the M&S campaigns and replace And McPartlin at the show "I'm A Celebrity" on ITV.
A source from Jones's close environment said last night, "We wouldn't want to comment on his business."
We were tough, and then we fell in love.
He complained about the criticism received from the media about a school that some would think was inappropriate for a president, as well as his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trab make so many concessions?
The Trab said fainter was the style of a televiser.
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting, since the first meeting in Singapore in June was welcomed by the Trab as a major step towards the nuclearisation of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ray Young-Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see any "anti-response" from the United States after the early disarmament of North Korea.
On the other hand, he pointed out that the United States continues to apply sanctions aimed at exerting pressure.
Trab kept a much more optimistic attitude in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We're almost at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
We have now built this excellent relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim gave positive results - ending the fire tests, releasing hostages and returning other American soldiers to their homes.
While supporting his unusual position in his statements on his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to have a 'president' style, but instead of having 10,000 people sitting outside the room because they couldn't get in, we'd only have 200 people here," the Trab said, showing the crowd in front of him.
tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia hit a whole island, leaving thousands dead in their passage
In the wake of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it was announced that the assistance of foreign non-governmental organizations would not be required.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok was exposed, there was no national disaster, a necessary condition for the use of international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they are not asking for international help, so it is quite difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save the Children are preparing a team that will travel to Palus, it is not yet certain whether foreign personnel can work on the spot.
Mr. Sutopo, representative of the National Natural Disasters Service, said that the Indonesian authorities assessed the situation in Palo to see if it would be possible for international organisations to contribute assistance.
Given the seismic visions that often affect Indonesia, the country remains unresolved against the wrath of nature.
While shelters have been built for tsunamis in Atse, the same does not happen on other highways.
The apparent lack of a series of tsunami alarms in Palus, even after warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of so many lives.
In the best case, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters involve even more administrative care.
A large hospital that had been stationed in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is heading to the Palus, but it will take at least three days to reach the location of the new destruction.
President Joco Weidondo was at the centre of his campaign to improve the organized infrastructures of Indonesia and provided easy money for the construction of roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding stifles Mr. Joco's administration before re-election next year.
Mr. Joco also accepts pressure from her persistent fanatic tendencies in Indonesia, where the members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people lost their lives and tens of thousands were exposed as Christian and Muslim groups fight on the streets, using swords, toxins, and bows, as well as other self - planned weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sterize of Liverpool is snooping against Chelsea
Daniel Steridge saved Liverpool from a fight at the Premier League against Chelsea with a golf course on the 89th-minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sterize accepted everything from Sardan Sakiri about 27 meters away from Chelsea's end with his team losing with 1-0.
Hit the ball on his left and shoot at the back dock.
His effort was very high from the big area and ended up on the right in the grids.
The ball finally fell over Cape Arizapalaga and jumped to the ground and entered the grids.
"I was trying to get this position, get to the ball, and players like Sakiri are always playing as much forward as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible," Sterridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kandé come close, I made a direct change, I didn't think much of it, and I made the shot."
Chelsea had the lead with 1-0 in the mid-year after the golf course at 25 minutes from Belgian star Eden Azar.
The blue gunman gave all the tacos to Mateo Kovacs in this game, before giving a shot with a fake near the center of the platform and running on the side of Liverpool.
Kovacchis did one in the middle of the floor.
Then he gave him a deep fight, leading Azariah to the big area.
Azar ran in front of the defendant and finished sending the ball to the rear docks with a left jacket in front of Alison Baker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight Naples at the 3rd season of the Champions League in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday.
Chelsea will deal with Videoton at UEFA Europa League on Thursday 3 p.m. in London.
The tragic account of the deaths from tsunami in Indonesia is 832
The death penalty after the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia is 832, according to the declarations of the country's Natural Disaster Service, early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of the buildings that collapsed after the 7.5-degree earthquake that struck the area on Friday and created waves 6 meters high, the service representative, Sutopo Puroo Nugroho, said at a type interview.
The city of Palus, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the ruins of the ruined buildings.
Police took 32 years, suspect, after murder of a woman with a knife
A murder investigation began after the discovery of a woman's body in Birkend, Merceiside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 p.m. with injuries from soldiers at Grayson Mouse in John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect for murder.
The police asked the visitors who saw or heard something to report it to the police.
Officer Brian Ohaegan said, "The investigation is at an early stage, but I'd like to address a call to anyone in the neighborhood around John Street and he saw or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I would also like to address a call to anyone, especially the taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the planes from the Dashcam cameras to contact us as they may have their information that is vital to our research."
A police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a citizen of Birkend and was found in a building.
Today afternoon friends who think they can meet the woman came to the scene of the crime to ask questions about the location where she was found this morning.
The investigations are in progress as the police said they are in the process of informing the closest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mouse, in his attempt to return to his apartment, was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He remained silent when he discovered what happened.
The tenants were informed that they may need to spend hours before they are allowed to return to their homes.
A police officer would say to a man that the whole area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman showed up with blood on the scene.
He kept saying, "It's scary."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were located through the police station and one outside.
Cops were standing outside the corridor watching the apartment.
Anyone has any information is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crimestoppers line at 0800 555 111 for Case 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's temple in Parliament is the last monument affected by the philosophy of "recording history"
His estracism would be a critical justice for the Taliban destruction of many of England's cultural and religious works by his fanatic quarter supporters.
However, Mr Cromwell has described Mr. Creek's proposal as "announcing" and "the effort to reinstate the story".
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Council, said: "In this debate on the removal of the waves, it was inevitable that the shape of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Industries would not be targeted.
The iconoclasy of England’s civil wars was neither banned nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps a member of the Cromwell family was wrong to have sacrificed for the actions of Thomas’s origin in the previous century.
The excellent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thornichroff is characteristic of his painting in the 19th century and part of the story of a personality that many believe is worth a price.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is still considered by many, perhaps more by the end of the 19th century in relation to today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course the monarchy.
The fact that this is a very precise case is the subject of an open historical debate.
The only thing that is certain is that the conflicts in the middle of the 17th century formed the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable personality that represents one side of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy and worthy."
Dog-killer injured a deadly Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southwestern China, according to local news reports.
The man, whose name was only known as "Owan", was found with cut blood in a lake near a pighouse on the market in Lioupansui in Guitsuo province, South China announced Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farm official is preparing to carry out pigs vaccinations on 30 May 2005 in Zing in the province of Kinshasa, China.
He was brought to travel with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and opened the door of a neighboring pighouse.
He said there was a large male pig in his mouth in the pighouse.
The doctor's examination confirmed that the pig weighing 227 kg had injured the farmer fatally, according to his report.
"My cousin's feet were dead and broken," said the cousin, known as "Go", according to the Guyang's evening newsletter.
The security camera plans show Wyan to enter the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Wyan or his cousin.
A market manager said in the evening news sheet that the pig has been placed in a cage so as not to attack anyone else, while the police collected the evidence at the scene of the attack.
Wean's family and market authorities are going to negotiate some compensation for his death.
Although Spanish, cases of swine attacks in humans have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, seriously hurting the man.
Ten years ago, a 295 - kilo [295 - kg] pig threw a farmer in the Netherlands over the tractor until the farmer's wife feared the animal to be removed.
After the incident in which a farmer from Oregon was torn apart by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as an "infection".
"They just have a playful disposition.
They're small, very weird creatures... they don't want to do anything wrong.
We should just show them the proper respect," he said.
The remnants of Mount Rosa are going to bring extensive rainfalls in the South-West United States
According to the forecasts, typhoon Rosa is suffering as she moves above the coldest water masses of the northern coasts of Mexico.
However, typhoon Rosa will bring floodwaters to the North of Mexico and the South of the United States in the following days.
The power of the winds of the pink typhoon reached 85 mph, being a Category 1 typhoon at 5 am. East hour, Sunday and found 385 miles south-west of Puta Euhenia, in Mexico.
Typhoon Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low wind pressure area has begun to form above the Pacific Ocean and to move east towards the Western Pacific. As the Rosa typhoon approaches the lower California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will bring tropical moisture to the north in the South-West USA.
Roza typhoon will bring rainfalls of 25 million in areas of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity combined with the area of low wind pressures approaching will create extensive heavy rainfalls in the Southwest in the following days.
Locally, rains of 2.5 to 10 million will cause dangerous floods, floods and possible flooding in the desert.
The deep tropical humidity will lead to rainfall rates approaching 5 to 7.5 million hours per day, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
5 to 10 million mountains are expected to be located in the Southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Floods are possible with a rapid deterioration of the phenomena due to the dispersal nature of tropical rainfalls.
It is recommended to avoid any movement by foot in the desert in view of the threat of tropical rainfall.
The strong rainfalls can turn the ferries into river basins and the storms will cause local spores of wind and ammo.
The low wind pressure area will create some locally strong rainfalls across the coast of Southern California.
A total of rainfalls over 1 percent is possible, which may cause small flooding and lumbarity in the streets.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Some split tropical pines will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early morning on Monday, before the phenomena are extended late Monday and Tuesday.
The strong rainfalls will spread in the For Corners area on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes will be observed throughout the United States as temperatures fall in the Arctic, but in the tropical zones they remain quite high.
Sometimes, this leads to very intense temperature changes in close distances.
A characteristic example of the intense differences in temperature between Central Americas was observed on Sunday.
There was a difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Mizuri and Groupa, Nebraska and St. Louis and De Moine, in Iowa.
In the following days, persistent high heat temperatures will be observed and spread again.
In much of the Central and Eastern USA, October is expected to start with high temperatures at 27 °C from the East to parts in the South-East.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 °C on Tuesday, about 5 degrees above average.
According to our long-term forecast for the weather, there are several possibilities for temperatures to be observed above average in the Eastern United States until the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers watched Bret Cavano's hearing
More than 20 million TV viewers have been monitoring the official submission of the candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court of Brett Kawano, Thursday and the woman charged with sexual assault, which is due to happen in the 1980s, Christine Blaise Ford, on six television networks.
In the meantime, the political failure continued, with television networks, to interrupt the normal flow of the programme for the last time of Friday: the agreement by the Mayor of Arizona Jeff Fleic to conduct a one-week investigation by the FBI in relation to the categories.
Ford told the Justice Committee of Georgia that it's 100 percent sure how at a party while she was a high school student, Kavano attacked her while she was drunk and took her clothes off.
Kavano, in a loaded deposit, said it's 100 percent sure that something like this didn't happen.
According to Nielsen's measurements, more than 20.4 million TVs are likely to be heard on Friday.
The company submitted the average television on the networks CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that broadcasted the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually finds it difficult to calculate the number of TVs watching a broadcast from office premises.
To see this television in its proper dimensions, it is a common size with what is being observed as a football match of the Oskar award ceremony.
The Fox News channel, whose journalists strongly supported the appointment of Kawano, was preceded by an average of 5.69 million TVs during the entire day’s hearing, according to Nielsen.
In the second place, ABC is located with 3.26 million TVs.
They followed CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high and after the hearing.
Fleic turned out to be a champion in Friday's drama.
After the Republican metropath said he would vote in favour of Kavano, the CNN and CBS cameras registered Friday morning demonstrators to test him as he was trying to get into the elevator for hearing from the Justice Committee of Georgia.
He stood there watching low for a few minutes as they saw him live on TV at CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
He said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Fleic said that his office had made statements and, before his elevators were closed, that he would have more to say in the Commission's hearing.
All cable television and transmission networks were covered alive a few hours later, the vote by the Justice Committee of Georgia on the promotion of Kawan's candidacy in the whole of Georgia to vote.
However, Fleic said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the claims against the candidate next week, something requested by the minority of the Democrats.
Fleic believed in part after discussions with his friend, Governor of the Democratic Party, Chris Kuns.
After discussions with the Couns and some other mayors, Fleic decided.
Fleic's choice was valid because it was obvious that the Republicans would not gather the votes for the Cavan's approval without conducting an investigation.
President Trab asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavano.
British Prime Minister May blames her critics for playing games with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused the critics of leaving the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in a conference with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives at the Constituent Party Conference in Berminham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her own in the paper's front page, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson has been very critical of the Chekers Project on Brexit, saying that the proposal to collect duties between Britain and the EU was "very absurd".
Shooting Wade Sims: Police arrested Suspect Dataon Simson for murdering the player in LSU
Police picked up a suspect for the deadly shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dayon Simson, 20 years old, was arrested and detained in second-degree murder, according to Baton Rose's police department.
The authorities have in their hands a video from Sims' complex with Simson and according to the police Sims lost his glasses during the box.
The police found the glasses on the scene of the crime and said they detected traces of Simson's DNA, according to the WAFB working with the CBS.
After Simson's investigation, the police said he admitted that he had wounded Wade fatally.
His guarantee was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
According to the preliminary report by East Baton Rose's medical judge who released Friday, the cause of death is the bullet wound in the head and neck.
The Ministry made available to the Louisiana Police a special working group, the crime lab of the police, the police forces of the South University and the citizens of the region for assistance in the investigation of arrest.
LSU's sports director Joey Alèva welcomed the local law enforcement authorities for "a sound investigation and the pursuit of justice performance".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,984 - foot - high - above - ground farm raised Baton Rose, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 ribwoods per race last season.
On Friday morning, the coach of the LSU Wave Wade basketball team said the team is "concentrated" and "in shock" since Weid's death.
"We're always worried about events like this," Wade said.
Helicopter emissions in Mexico City
The tropical ash emissions from the Popocapetl volcano reached the southern neighbours of Mexico’s capital.
The National Catastrophe Prevention Centre warned Mexican residents on Sunday to stay away from the volcano, after the activity in the tank reached its peak, recording 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The Centre was monitoring various indications and small seismic visions.
Images in the social media show car parbridge covered with minute ash layers in neighboring Mexico City like Sochimilco.
The geophysics have observed an increase in the activity of the continent, which is 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital since a 7.1 earthquake occurred in central Mexico in September 2017.
The epoch, known as Don Gogio, has been active since 1994.
Police forces clash with Catalan self-defencers in view of the vote on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a conflict of protestors in favour of independence with the class recovery units, as thousands participated in the protests for the first anniversary of the vote on the rejection of Catalonia that caused pollution.
A group of mass protestors for independence, which were held by the order restoration units, hatched eggs and powdered powder, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually blocked by tourists.
Complications were also noted later during the day with the police to use their clubs to make the complications.
In hours, groups of supporters of Catalonia's independence called the slogan "Don't Forgive, We Do Not Forget" against groups of protesters for the unity of the country called "Live Spain".
Ten people were hospitalized with microinjuries observed during the demonstrations, according to the local type.
The tensions remain high in the area that supports independence one year after the declaration of the 1 October referendum as illegal by Madrid, which is however celebrated by the Catalans.
The overwhelming majority of the voters chose independence, although accession was low with those against independence to vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year, after the police authorities tried to stop the vote at the polling stations in the region where violent complications occurred.
Teams for independence held early on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration was carried out and another amendment was required.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the protests for independence with his wife, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's prospects to win his independence.
"We lived one of our brightest moments last year.
I saw my parents with tears of joy who managed to vote, but now the situation is stable," he said.
Despite the fact that they have won a victory of vital importance, while limited in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties have fought for independence to maintain their strength this year, with many of their most well-known leaders to be self-excellent or to be held in custody in anticipation of their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Putes, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protests for the police with his cell phone, said that the conflicts were fueled by both politicians and the two troops.
"The tension is growing more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Zunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who were imprisoned last year, announced his candidacy in the European elections for the next year.
"My candidacy in the European elections is the best way to challenge the suppression of democratic values and the pressure we have been granted by the Spanish Government," he said.
London: Man arrest after a car hit in the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a repeated car accident in London.
The event took place in Bolingcard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemings said damage to the gates and the building itself was caused.
There may have been a shooting in the car at some point.
Menga's hit won the Livingstone 1-0 against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first ball for Livingstone secured the victory
Provincial Livingston surprised the Rangers by thanking Stephen Jarard just for his second in 18 games as the manager of the Ambrox group.
Dolly Menga's blow made the difference as Gary Holt's side changed the level with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's team remains unbeatable at the championship this season and faces the Cards, who have the eight-degree lead on the next Sunday.
Before this game, the Rangers host Rapind Viennese in Europe League on Thursday.
Livingston in the middle continues its course in six games in her category, with basic coach Holt not yet tasted anything since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before she scored, with her inability to bring the Rangers in a difficult position.
Scott Robinson took a lead and thought he'd get there before the end, but Alan Lithkow refused his attempt by glimmering Craig Halket's head away from the end.
The peasants have allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could beat the visitors in free beatings and corners.
And that's how the big ball came.
The Rangers couldn't stop a free shot, and Livingston opened up, Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to send the ball to Mengca, who took it all and ran from the center of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated the ball but found the defense of the peasants uninterrupted and the security guard Liam Kelly did not face difficult situations.
This pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos shot down the ball from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's ball was cut off from the ranks of Rangers Alan McGregor, and Lithkou's sand came out in another free hit of Livingstone.
There were many stalls in the Livingstone area, and they were constantly being denied, while two bars were asked - after Halket's award of the ball against the replacement player Glen Midleton and one for the hand - were rejected.
"Excellent game" by Livingstone - analysis
Alsder Lamont from BBC Scotland on Tony Macaroni Arena
Thematic performance and results for Livingstone.
All of them, however, were exceptional, exceeding expectations in this unparalleled course.
The style of the game and their personality changed at least after their return to top form, but the stamps should also be given to Holt for the drive he gave to the team with his arrival .
His team had so many heroes.
Chief Halket was excellent, returning an extremely organized defense, while Mengka kept Connor Goldson and Joy Weirl in custody throughout the game.
The Rangers, on the other hand, had no inspiration.
As good as they were in the past under the direction of Gerard, they did not respond to these standards.
Their last game was poor - only once they managed to pass the defense of the fields, and this is a warning campaign for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the ranking.
Mixed feelings at Erdogan’s reception in Cologne
The climate was good on Saturday (29 September) at the meeting of the Heads of State of Turkey and Germany for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed at restoring relations with NATO allies.
They had come to an end on issues such as human rights, type freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to launch a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police excluded the concentration of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom were from Kurdish origin - also gave this present, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The division of demonstrators reflects the controversial nature of a visitor treated by some Turkish people as a hero and by others as a dictator.
Traffic accident in Detford: a dead bike after a car crash
A biker lost his life in a car crash in London.
The accident took place near the intersection of the streets of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a multi-species road in Detford, south-east of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and the ambulance's saviors tried to help, but the man lost his life on the spot.
The conflict took place a few months after a similar incident where a driver hit and abandoned a bicycle, who lost his life on the road of Chillers Street, about 1.6 miles from the accident of Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said the authorities are making efforts to identify the man and inform their closest relatives.
The roads have closed and the roads of the buses have been trained, while the drivers have received instructions to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six policemen were injured in complications
Six policemen were injured in riots that broke out in the high-security men's prisons, according to the statements of the Prison Directorate.
Trials broke out in the prisons of this Grand Duchy Long Lartin in Worstersair at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still in progress.
Special police forces called "Tornado" have returned to deal with the shocks, involving eight prisoners and who have appeared on a block.
The police were hospitalized with microinjuries on the face during the complexes.
A representative of the prison said: "A specially trained staff took over the event in the prisons of this Magnificent Long Lartin.
Six staff members were hospitalized with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be inflamed with the police authorities and may be subject to a greater penalty."
More than 500 prisoners are held in the prisons of this Grand Duchy, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the Prison Administration was hospitalized after an attack by a prisoner.
In October last year, the class recovery units were called to prison to send serious incidents that broke out during which staff members were attacked with balliards.
Roza typhoon threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (dry areas may benefit)
It is rare to have a tropical effect on Arizona, but this is precisely likely to happen at the beginning of next week, as the remnants of Mount Rosa will cross the southwest parts of the desert, bringing floods to their shores.
The National Weather Service has already issued emergency alerts for floods for Monday and Tuesday from the west Arizona to the south and east Nevada, the south-east California and the south-east of Juta, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Roza typhoon is expected to pass just above Phoenix on Tuesday, where it will arrive late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service pointed out on its tweet that only ten tropical cyclones have remained in a tropical storm or low barometer at less than 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a typhoon less than 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the U.S. National Bridge Centre provide a rainfall of between 2 and 4 inches, with individual rain volumes of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other parts of the South Western States, including the Central Brachods Mountains and the Grey Basin, rainfalls of 1 to 2 inches are likely to occur, with the possibility of individual total rainfalls up to 4 inches.
For areas that are not at risk from the floods, the rain that Rosa brings may be a blessing, as the area is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, a part of this rainfall is expected to be beneficial, as the South-West states are experiencing drought conditions today.
According to the U.S. Recovery Observatory, more than 40 per cent of Arizona faces at least extreme drought, which is the second highest drought category," said weather.com.
First, Mount Rosa will reach the shores of the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Maintaining the intensity of the storm, in the morning of Sunday, Rosa will be located 385 miles south of Puta Eugenia Mexico with a maximum of 85 miles per hour and will move north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will meet colder water in the Pacific and will therefore be weakened.
Thus, it is expected to reach the ceiling in Mexico with tropical storm intensity in the afternoon or at night of Monday.
There may be a severe rainfall in regions of Mexico, which will pose a significant risk of floods.
"There are expected total rainfall volumes of between 3 and 6 inches from Baha California to the northwest Sonora, which are likely to reach up to 10 inches", according to weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical storm now and reach the Arizona border early in the morning of Tuesday as a tropical low barometer, which will then pass through Arizona to reach South Juta late in the night of Tuesday.
"The main risk expected by the Rose storm or its remains is the very intense rainfall in Baha California, the northwest Sonora and the South-West states of the United States," said the U.S. National Bridge Centre.
These rains are expected to result in dangerous heavy floods and snowflakes in the deserts and settlements in the mountainous areas.
Attack on Mindsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested as suspects of attempted suicide after the identification of a 16-year-old who was injured by a knife in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Teras region of Midsomer Norton, about 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he remains in "stabil" state.
A 17-year-old, two- 18-year-old, and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Randstock area, said AVP and Somerset.
The cops are calling to present anyone who may have recorded on a video on his phone what happened.
Trab says Kavano "lived the evil and the anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote in favour of Judge Kavano is a vote to reject the unfair and offensive regimes of the Democratic Party," Trab said at a meeting in Willing in West Virginia.
Trab said Kavano "lived the evil and the anger" of the Democratic Party all the time during his demonstration process as a candidate.
Kawano posted to Congress on Thursday, denied indictable and apparently motivated by Christine Blaise Ford's claims that she had been sexually assaulted decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also set up a hearing for her claims.
The President said Saturday that "the American people saw the great, the quality and the courage" of Kavano that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavano's candidacy is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our day, a lawyer with an excellent public service path," he said to the majority of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to the Kawano's candidacy while speaking about the importance of Republicans' participation in the intermediate elections.
"We hold five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but actually it's like I am," he said.
"That's why I travel everywhere supporting excellent candidates."
The Trab reported that the Republicans are on "resistance and prevention" mission.
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the candidacy of Kawan is expected to take place at the latest on Friday, the CNN referred to a senior auxiliary member of the Republican Party's leadership.
Hundreds of people were killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia and the total number of victims is expected to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were driven by the giant waves that destroyed the coasts, when a great earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities declared Sunday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Paul on Friday, when waves of six feet [6 m] hit the shore of the lake, killing many to death and destroying everything in their passage.
The tsunami occurred after earthquake 7.5, Richter.
"When the threat to tsunami came out yesterday, the world was still on the beach and it didn't run right away, so it was hit by it," Sutopo Puruo Nugroho, a representative of the Indonesian BNPB disaster management service, told Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, drove cars, trees, houses, hit everything in the hole," declared Nogroho, adding that the tsunami had travelled to the ocean at speeds 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people crawled into the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he reported.
About 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centres in Palou.
Aerophotos published by the disaster management service show many destroyed buildings and shops, bridges that have been built and destroyed and a roof surrounded by water.
Movements continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Service (BPPT) reported that the energy released from the huge earthquake of Friday was about 200 times greater than the power of the individual bomb that fell in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and reported that hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
He reported that victims were found trapped under the wreckage of broken buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were ignored.
Nugroho said that the victims and damage may be larger along the coast 300 km north of Palou, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the centre of the earthquake.
The communication systems "have completely failed and there is no information" from Dongala, he said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," Red Stairs said in his statement, adding that his staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy and it can get even worse," he said.
Eurasian criticism was carried out at the Service on Saturday because it did not inform that tsunami had hit the Palus, even though according to officials the waves had reached the time of the warning.
In a racist video reported in the social media, a man on the top of a building seems to be shouting panic in an attempt to warn people down the road for the tsunami that is coming.
In a few minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, scattering homes and cars.
The Reuters office was unable to verify the visibility of the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a great interruption of the current, which also cut off communications in the wider region of Palus, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts from the authorities.
The army began sending transport planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the displaced continue to need food and other basic necessities.
The city airport only reopened to contribute to the bidding efforts and will remain closed until October.
A visit by President Joco Wyndonto has been scheduled at the decommissioning centres in Palo on Sunday.
The tsunami victims in Indonesia are more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although World Vision's staff from Dongala managed to safely reach the city of Palou, where workers found refuge in accommodations from museums set up in front of their office, passed through disaster scenes on their way, said Mr. Dosseba.
"They told me they saw many ruined houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some guest groups have taken the sad task of initiating the relief process of the injured, some complain that it did not affect foreign, particularly experienced workers in the area of assistance to travel to Palou.
In accordance with the regulations of Indonesia, the flow of funding, supplies and personnel from outside may only be started if the place of a transaction is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It continues to be a disaster at the level of the province," Aulia Ariani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Star, said.
"When the government says it is a national disaster, we can address a request for international assistance, but there is no relevant decision yet."
As the second day went by in Palus after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and family who are still missing hope that their loved ones will still be the miracle that will make the story of these natural disasters less ghastly.
On Saturday, a little boy was kidnapped by a lawyer.
On Sunday, the saviors released a woman who had been imprisoned for two days by her mother's dead body.
Genton Subadono, a coach of the national team of al-Alexitate Beach of Indonesia, had trained two of the missing al-Alexistists for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people who were arrested at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Madge, were his students.
"The oldest in the sport of the elliptical plagiarism, I have my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Genton was told how, when news of the collapse of Roa Roa Roa Hotel was released in the community of the alexitist beaches, he began to send unexpected messages to his opponents in the palace who participated in the festival on the beach.
However, the indication next to his messages was a grey symbol "n", instead of two blues.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
The thieves broke down $26,750 in the supply of an automatic pick-up machine in Newport and Levi.
In the morning of Friday, the thieves broke off $26,750 from a Brink staff member who was re-supplying the ATM machine in Newport and Levi, according to a Newport Police Department note.
The driver had removed an ATM machine in the entertainment unit and was preparing to deliver other money, police officer Dennis McCarthy reported in the notice.
While he was busy, another man "was running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects leaving the scene, according to the notice, but the police didn't identify the number of those involved in the event.
Anyone has information about their identity should contact the Newport police, calling at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Yu
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Yee.
Advertised the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The one who is officially known as Kanie West."
West, 41 years old, has been listening for a long time to the chirping Yu and used this nickname as a title on his eighth album, which he released in June.
The change was preceded by his appearance at the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to present the new Yandhi album.
In contrast to the show, the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her appearance for "sympathetic reasons", as the show's creator said.
Apart from being a summary of the professional name used today, West had stated in the past that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think the word 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, in a discussion about his album title with the radio producer Big Boy.
So it's you, it's us, it's us.
My name changes from Kanie, which means "the only one", to Yu, which is just a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused ourselves, everything.
The album is probably a reflection of who we are."
It's one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sin Cobbs is known for various names, such as Paf Dandy, P. D.D. or D.D., but he announced this year that he prefers the names Love and Brader Love.
A former West co-worker, TZI-ZI, is also satisfied with the use of his name with or without shoes and capital letters.
The elected president of Mexico swears he won't use the army against the citizens
Mexican elected President Andres Manuel Lobez Obrador swore he would never use military violence against citizens, as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody student oppression.
Lobez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolo Square that "he will never use the army to crush the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, during a period when left student movements received roots throughout Latin America.
Lobez Obrador was committed to supporting the new Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drive young people to criminal societies.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field, says the investor and professional in the field of artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment comes to be added to the notices made by various parts of the US government on artificial intelligence, as the US does not have an official strategy for artificial intelligence at all.
Meanwhile, China presented last year its plan to become the world's first country in innovation on artificial intelligence issues by 2030.
"The duplication of the research budget on artificial intelligence would be a good principle, since all other countries remain so much in the US and we are trying to make the next important discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The duplication of the budget could double the chances of the next major achievement in the US in the field of artificial intelligence, Li said in his interview with the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book entitled "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (The Powers of the Artistic Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order of things) released this month of the editions Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is Director of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's top arts companies, Face+.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in a system of artificial intelligence that won the best American player Otello, while later he was executive of Microsoft Research and president of the Google Annex in China.
Lee recognised the importance of previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Advanced Defence Research Plans Service (DARPA), and wondered when the next will be conducted to identify the next spectators.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to receive state grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the best of the academic space, it's companies," he said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired authorities from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee argued that changes in migration policy could also help the US to support its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that a green card should be offered automatically to medical diplomats in artificial intelligence," he said.
The State Council of China issued a Plan for the Development of the Next Generation Art in July 2017.
The National Institute of Natural Sciences of China provides funding to people in academic institutions such as the National Institute of Sciences and other government organizations share money in American researchers, but the quality of the academic project in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established a Joint Arts Centre, which will include partners from the business and academic world, and the White House announced the formation of an Armed Commission for the Artist Science.
This month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The US National Science Foundation today invests more than $100 million annually in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, no progress has been made in US legislation for months to set up a National Security Committee for Artificial Law.
Macedonia's citizens are holding a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia took part in a referendum on Sunday to decide whether the country would be allocated to "the Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would lead to a decade-long dispute with Greece that had blocked the country's bid to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, supports that the name of the northern neighbouring country represents a prosecution on its territory and has committed veto to its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not participate in the referendum and a Boikotaz campaign has raised doubts as to whether participation would reach the required 50 per cent to be valid for the referendum.
The question on the vote was: 'You are in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the agreement with Greece'.
The armsmen of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeif, support that it is a price worth trying to integrate into organisations such as the EU and NATO for the MDG, one of the countries that have emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the country's future, to allow the GDR's young people to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because so our lives will be safer," said Oliver Georgievska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a number of Members of Parliament have stated that they will comply with the outcome of the vote in order to become final.
A two-thirds majority is required to change the name in Parliament.
The State Election Committee stated that there were no reports of irregularities up to 1 m.
However, the participation reached only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, so it gave the present 66 per cent of the registered voters.
"I have come to vote for my children, our position is in Europe," said José Tanevski, 62-year-old voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoraf Zeif, Zorika's wife and son, Dousko, voted in the referendum on the change of the name of the country to open the way for the country's accession to NATO and the European Union to the city of Stromika of Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vlandimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small scene and places chairs in front of scenes set by those who will vote.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with the head high, not as second-class partners," Kavardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others such as China and Russia, and become members of the expatriate union."
Prime Minister Zaif said that NATO membership will bring multi-stakeholder investment to the MDG, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zeif said after he voted.
He said that a positive result would be "the confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published last Monday by the MDG Political Research Institute, the referendum would have been a percentage of 30 to 43 per cent of the voters, i.e. less than the required participation.
According to another survey conducted by the TV station Telma TV of Macedonia, 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said he would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be successful, participation must reach 50 per cent together with one vote.
If the referendum fails, this will be the first serious blow in the politics of the friendly government, from its humiliation in power last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguro spends all of Breaton's defense to set up a golf course.
Sergio Aguro and Rahim Sterling were the Briton's defense winning 2-0 for Manchester City on Saturday at Ethihand Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguro has shown himself to score slowly in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker took everything in the middle of the field at the beginning of the phase.
He's been through three Briton's defenses before he forgets about the open space.
Then Agur was found surrounded by four green players.
He went through with a tricycle of a defender, then running away from several others at the end of the large Briton area.
Then he gave everything to his left, finding Sterling.
English Farmworth made his first move to the area by returning the ball to Aguro, who used his right foot to win the Briton Matthew Ryan's termite guard, scored right-hand side of the grid.
"Aguro is facing some problems at his feet," city teacher Pep Guaridola told reporters.
"We've come to play 55 with 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a ball at the time."
However, it was Sterling who gave the sailors the initial advantage in the battle of Prime Minister Lig.
This bullet came in 29 minutes.
Aguro took the ball deep in Briton's area at this stage.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left-hand side to Liroy Shane.
Shane kept the ball in his possession and led Sterling to the back dock.
The gallbladdder hit the ball on the grid just before it came out.
The City is facing Hofenheim in the Chambions Lig groups on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. on the Rain-Neckar Arena field in Sinsheim, Germany.
Sergeant wants to beat the Rockys.
As the Niasionals were excluded from the playoffs, there was no reason to try to make another launch.
But the always competitive Sergeant hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there's still any impact on the Rockies on the beach, as they advance through a game by Los Angeles Dodgers in the Nazional Lig West.
The Rockies have passed through the playoffs with their victory 5-2 against the Nazionals on Friday night, but they still want to lock the first position in their category.
"A messenger we don't have to win, at least we can play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the fans and the other team will be a game of the highest level I'm going to face this year.
Why don't I want to fight in such a fight?"
The Nazis have not yet announced who the original thrower will be on Sunday, but it is reported that they tend to let the Sharer throw the ball.
Sergeant, who's going to make his 34th launch, did training on Thursday, and he's going to play Sunday, which is usually a day of rest for him.
The right hand from Washington has a performance of 18-7 with average score points (ERA) 2.53 and 300 out due to strike in 220 2/3 periods this season.
Trab speaking in West Virginia
The President directly referred to the situation regarding his elected candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Kawano, in his speech on the importance of Republicans' participation in the intermediate elections.
"All we've done is covert in November.
We have five weeks from one of the most important electoral procedures in our lives.
This is a very important moment, but I am not a candidate, but in fact it is like I am and, for this reason, I travel everywhere to support excellent candidates," he said.
The Trab continued, "You see this ridiculous, ridiculous group of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power using any necessary means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they need to get rid of to take power and control, because what they want is power and control and we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have taken up the mission of "resistance and prevention".
"And you see this in the last four days," he said, characterizing the Democrats "fear and evil, hatred and lies."
It was referred to the Judicial Committee of Georgia by giving nominees to the Mayor of the Republic of Denmark, a report which was accepted with possible public approval.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you find the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, no, no, I'm waiting for an answer, that was a really bad use of the body language, the worst use of the body language I've ever seen."
The Working Party is no longer a broad extension.
It is not tolerant of those who express their opinion
It didn't surprise me at all that Momentum's activists in my local team voted to make fun of me.
In addition, I am the last of a number of Members of the Working Party to whom they said they were not welcome, precisely because we say our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, had a similar attitude because he was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, my motion of complaint was criticized because I called Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of a responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, for tradition, for similar issues with which Jeremy had argued with previous leaders.
The call for the Sunday East Labour meeting said on Friday that "we want our meetings to be productive with everyone's participation."
During most of the eight-year term I am a local worker, the meetings of the General Committee on Friday night were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more plausible, more compassionate" policy has been forgotten for a long time if it has ever really begun to come into effect.
It is increasingly evident that the different views are not inflexible in the Working Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable by the party's leadership.
This started a little after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom I had previously considered that we had similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 people and adopt views that I would never agree with, whether they were of national security or the single EU market.
Every time I spoke in public, no matter what I was really saying, I heard an emissism in the social media, where some people asked for my rejection, got rid of the policy of the centre and told me that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And that didn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know that I am happier than other colleagues, as the comments addressed to me were usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a winter of sexual or racist attacks every day, but they never fail.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time in politics is how the attacks are considered to be more regular.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a broad extension and that with any proposal for a compromise or a change in the rules of choice, the limits of the party are narrowing.
I have been advised by many in the last two years not to stand up, not to speak too much, and that "everything will be fine."
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a student, because of the neglect shown by the Government of Thatzer that has literally led to the failure of my entire class, my aim was to provide better public services for those who need them most, either as a member of the local council or as a minister of the government.
I have never hidden my policy, and I have done the same in the last elections.
No one in Southingham East could have been confused in any way with regard to my political views and points of disagreement with today's leadership.
To those who have promoted Friday's motion, the only thing I have to say is that, while the country is facing a Brexit that will affect our households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on whether I am faithful to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, really, my only message is not addressed to Momentum's members in Southingham, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Working Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of rejection or political will will prevent me from acting as I believe it is in the best interests of all of you.

Ir - Melrose: 38 - 17: The Invincible Ir ascends to the top
Two late golfers may have somehow reversed the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Ir deserved to triumph in this extremely fun today's game of Ted's championship.
It's now at the top of the ranking, the only unreal group of the ten.
Finally, it was her highest defense, as well as the best exploitation of the opportunities, which brought the yoke to the fields and coach Peter Murchi had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've tried our games so far and we're still being rude, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose said, "Congratulations in Ireland have taken advantage of the opportunities better than we have."
Grand Anderson's ball in the 14th minute, with Fraser Klimo's conversion, brought Air ahead, but a yellow card to Scotchzo Rory Hugs, who was committed to the Voiros game, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the digital advantage, and Jason Baggot scored a ball without conversion.
Climate has increased IR's progress with penalty, before it scored, precisely in the mid-year, a ball with conversion, leading IR to scores 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's golf course, with Bigcott's conversion, reduced progress to five degrees.
There was a long wait because of a serious injury by Ruard Nott, who was removed by a boat, and, after the resumption, Iir increased the difference with a golf course by Stafford McDonald, with climate change.
Deputy Chief Blair McCarson then took a yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of the digital advantage of Bruce Colvin's golf without conversion, after a period of intense pressure.
The peasants, however, returned, and, when Struan Hatzinson took a yellow card for the Taklin in the air without the ball, from the penal line, McCarson scored a golf at the back of the attack that Ir had launched.
Climate has undergone a transformation, as it has done almost again since the resumption, after Kyle Rowe first picked up David Armstrong's lock and sent Gregor Henry off for the fifth golf course in the fields.
Still Game winner starts a new career at the focus
The winner of the Still Game Ford Kiernan series shows ready to switch to the focus industry after it has been discovered that a director of an licensed restaurant company has been appointed.
56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays the role in the BBC's popular show, which he writes and in which he competes with his longtime partner at the Greg Hembfil comedy.
The couple announced that the next fifth round would also be the last of the show, and it appears that Kirnan is planning his life after the Greatland.
According to the official registers, he is the director of the company Agingermorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the information, although a source of Scottish Sun was accused that Kirnan wants to deal with the "absolute focus industry" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Closed Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the road to Peace
They run in the fully equipped captain of the ship in La Paz.
In the public buildings, there are blue flags floating.
At the base of the sea from the Titicaca Lake to the Amazon is written the slogan: "Our sea belongs to the right.
It's our duty to take her back."
Throughout Bolivia, the remembrance of the coast that Chile received after a bloody conflict for the exploitation of natural resources in the 19th century continues to be alive, as well as the desire of its people to travel to the Pacific once again.
These hopes have been postponed more than ever, for decades now, as Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October following five years of consultation.
"Bolivia has the strength, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course awaits the result with a positive look," said Roberto Calzandilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide for Bolivia's prosecution to have Chile, after ten years of unrest, negotiate for the granting in Bolivia of a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charming autonomic president of Bolivia, who gives a controversial battle for his re-election next year, has a lot to win or lose from Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is not likely to decide for Bolivia and that even if it did, they would not change much.
The UN agency in the Netherlands does not have the power to give thousands of land and has made it clear that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice is to be issued just six months after the presentation of the final proceedings indicates that the case "was not complex", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than further promoting the goals of Bolivia, the past four years may have undermined them.
"The current government of Bolivia has cleared up the issue of access to the sea," Zarate said.
Morelas's aggressive rhetoric has exhausted every remaining good mood of Chile, he supported.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk for a while, but it will be extremely difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries haven't exchanged mail since 1962.
Former President Edwardo Rodríguez Wellzee, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an excellent opportunity to launch a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "endowing 139 years of mutual benefit disputes", he said.
Calzandilla also denied that Morales, who still is one of the most popular leaders in Latin America, uses the issue of exit to the sea as a political dean.
"Bolivia will never refuse its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we must go through the past."
North Korea declares that there will be no nuclear disarmament if the US cannot be trusted
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Young Ho, says his state will never disarm his nuclear weapons first if he can't trust Washington.
Ri talked to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
Call on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit in Singapore by the heads of the two states.
Ri made these comments while US Foreign Minister Mike Pompey seems ready to relaunch the nuclear diplomacy he had reached at the end, three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea leader Kim Young Won.
Ri states that the view that the continued sanctions and the refusal of the United States to declare the end of the Korean War will at some point require the North to "genuine" is a dream of a hot night.
Washington is reluctant to agree to issue the declaration in question, if Piunjang does not make major disarmament movements first.
Both Kim and American President Donald Trab want a second summit.
But there is broad speculation about whether Pyongyang is seriously considering declaring a weapon that the country considers to be likely the only means guaranteeing its security.
Pompey plans to visit Piñang next month to prepare a second summit of top Kim-Trab.
The fashion proofs of Paris reveal the latest trends in the oversized hats that will soon be available in some store near you
If you want to raise the collection of hats you have or completely avoid the sun, then stop searching.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented in the passarela a series of extra-larged hats for their collection of Spring-Kalokari 2019 that stole the show in the Fashion Week in Paris.
Exceptionally bad hats opened the Instagram this summer and their designers sent their impressive creations to the pasarela.
The piece that he left Valentine was a super-bash hat decorated with a plate of leather that completely covered the head of the models.
Among other accessories were carpusy decorated with stones, a magic hat, even a pineapple, but these have not been designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a series of strange masks over the time for Halloween.
Many of the multicolored masks had rusted lips and were more into Hannibal Lekter than in a high-strength fashion.
One creation brought to mind the complete equipment of blasts with a blower and glasses, while another looked like molten ice in a hog.
And if you want to adopt this fashion style with the huge accessories, you're lucky.
Stylists predict that these huge hats could reach central commercial roads near you.
The oversized hats made their appearance very quickly after La Boba, the hunting hat with the very wide edge that we have seen wear so many, from Ryan to Emily Ratakovsky.
The popular company that created the extremely bad hat that exposed the social media sent still a great creation to the pasarela, a tiny beach bag almost as large as the model it wears by wearing its magic.
The dark orange bag of ruffs, decorated with raffs and a white leather handle, was the piece that disappeared from the La Raviera Spring-Kalokari 2019 collection of Jacquemus in the Fashion Week in Paris.
"I expect to see large hats and large beach bags in the shops next summer, as the designer made such a great feeling that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for excess accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are needed for the citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland have a prehistoric history of academic excellence, which continued in 2018, with a further series of excellent results in the examinations, which were simply reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other Community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Board of Independent Schools of Scotland (SCIS), strive to provide their students and parents with the best possible level of service.
The aim of independent schools is to prepare their students for the next and higher levels of education, the career course they will choose and their position as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a school curriculum by order, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable school choice lesson.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, then what you say goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, what you say goes to his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot simply be based on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's survey, we find that the languages are at the top of the performance tables, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages succeeded in a degree of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of the students achieved a degree of absolution A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also had a degree A.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages, as a choice course, are considered equally important to science, technology, engineering and mathematics courses in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 U.S. Employment and Skills Committee survey revealed that, with regard to the reasons why employers had difficulty covering jobs, 17 per cent of the class was lacking in language skills.
Therefore, the need for language skills becomes increasingly urgent so that young people are prepared for their future professional career.
Since more future employment opportunities require language skills, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career one will choose, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future, because of this privilege that he can enjoy throughout his life.
If anyone is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then automatically this multilingual person will have an advantage over competition.
According to a survey by YouGov in more than 4,000 adults in the US in 2013, 75 per cent of the respondents were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a discussion, while French was the only language speaking a double percentage of the respondents (15 per cent).
For this reason, investing in language teaching is important for today's children.
Knowing many languages, especially the languages of the developing economies, will give children the best opportunity to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the U.S. by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be some languages to choose in independent schools, which have specialized teaching staff in this area.
The independent schools of Scotland provide with dedication a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to achieve, whatever the future holds them.
No one today can deny that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be extremely important for the future of the country, so this reality should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, multiculturality and flexibility for Scotland's young people.
They have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
Lebron's gonna do his debate on Lakers on Sunday at San Diego.
The wait for the guests who are desperate to see Lebron make his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers has almost ended.
Lakers Luke Walton's coach announced that James was going to play the first game on Sunday before the match against the Denver Naguets in San Diego.
However, it has not yet been decided how many minutes it will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said in Lakers' official website.
Lakers' reporter Mike Trudel wrote on Twitter that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After training a few days ago, James was asked about his plans for the six games that Lakers have to give before the race period.
"I don't need preparations at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
The Trab concentration in West Virginia, Canali YouTube
President Donald Trab starts a series of meetings starting with West Virginia's Willing.
It is the first of five planned concentrations of the Trab next week, which includes periods in friendly desired areas, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm his choice of the Supreme Court to be held, the Trab seeks to strengthen public support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress by the vote in November.
What time is the Trab concentration in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
The Trab concentration in West Virginia Willing is scheduled for 7 μm ET tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch the Trab concentration in West Virginia online below via live stream on YouTube.
The Trab is likely to refer to the hearings of this week for the candidate for the position in the Supreme Court, Brett Kavano, which took place in a deep atmosphere due to allegations of sexual misconduct, with a vote confirming Georgia's expectation for up to one week while the FBI's investigation is in progress.
However, the primary objective of this series of mergers is to help Republicans who face amphibious outcome in the November elections in order to gain some momentum.
Thus, the outcome of President Trab's campaign stated that these five meetings next week aim at "mobilizing volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority of representatives in the Church and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so critical to its agenda that the president travels to as many states as possible, as we go to the multi-story campaign period," said Reuters representative of the Trab campaign, who wanted to remain anonymous.
The planned evening concentration at Wesbanco Arena in Willing could bring supporters from "Ohaio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, it will be the second time in the month that Trab visits West Virginia, the state that won a difference of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
The Trab is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in West Virginia for Georgia, who is low in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisei that the president must come and try to give him a push to the traps," said Simon Hender, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team has the tendency to fight by keeping the hopes alive as it leads to Sunday's singles
After three single-sided games, Saturday's squares might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The talented limbs of the band are a fully understood sport idea, but players believe it deeply, and especially in such measurements.
Where would they say the rope is now?
"There were six steps ahead and now there are four, so we probably have a little rope," Jordan Spit said as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage of, of course, four degrees ahead and twelve more in the game.
The Americans, as Spit says, feel the "air in their pans" and have plenty to encourage them, like the two Spits and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each one broke three degrees out of the four.
Spyth was deadly from tea to green and gives the example.
The cheering voices became more powerful as he continued his round, achieving a critical blow to get the game four all-square when he and Thomas were down two after two.
The blow they won the game at the 15th was accompanied by similar celebrations that show his belief that the American team is not outside.
"You have to look inside yourself deeply and worry about your game," Spit said.
That's what every player has left.
18 holes to write history.
The only players with more degrees than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flidwood, the unmistakable story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but precious twin of Europe has succeeded four in four and it seems that it does nothing wrong.
The "Molywood" was the only twin that didn't hit bogey in the afternoon of Saturday, but also escaped bogey in the morning of Saturday, the afternoon of Friday and the back nine in the morning of Friday.
This game, as well as the way the energy seems to flow to and from the noisy viewers, expresses the fact that it is the players that should win Sunday and that there is no more popular player than Flitwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory while the sun goes above Le Golf National.
At the same time, both preferable to different holes.
The debate on European honour remains premature.
Baba Watson and Web Simpson put their glasses on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball, when he played with Alex Noren.
With a bogey and two doubles on the front nine they had Spain and Sweden so deep in a hole they couldn't get out of it.
But Sunday, no one will help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so exciting to watch them closely because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a significant lead on the last day, but this foursome game has also shown that the US team has the balls, despite some doubts.
Europe takes the lead 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after its race at the fourballs and the foursomes on Saturday with 10-6 against the US.
The inspired twins of Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari had two victories at a struggling Tiger Woods and managed to take the lead in Le Golf National until now at four levels.
The European side of Thomas Byron, who is trying to maintain the troupe he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the missing American side in the morning fourball, with a series of 3-1.
The United States was more opposed to the foursomes, winning two matches, but they could not cover the difference.
Jim Furick's side needs eight degrees from the 12 single Sunday matches to keep the troupe.
Flitwood is the first new-looking European player to win four-degree series, while with Molinari, also known as "Molywood", after a clumsy weekend, it is just the second two that wins four-degrees in the first four matches in the story of Ryder Cup.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reid at the fourballs, they joined their forces to destroy a tired Woods and the American new-looking Brason DeSambo with an even more vivid 5&4.
Woods, who fought the two Saturday matches, showed occasional flash of light, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourball and foursome and seven series.
Justin Rose, who rested for the morning fourball, returned to Henry Stanson's match for the 2&1 foursomes of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka, winning the first and third place in the world ranking.
They did not all go well for Europe, despite the pleasant, busy day of south-west Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas put on the bus for the Americans two-degree Saturday.
They won a hard win 2+1 on the John Ram and Ian Pauler of Spain at the fourballs and returned later to win the Pauler and Rory Macilroy 4&3 at the foursomes while losing the two holes at the opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history could a team recover while losing four degrees in the singles, although because it's the tripler, Furick is enough to achieve equality to maintain the troupe.
However, since it was found in second place for two days, it seems that a opposition to Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it's not going to be disarmed alone without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions deepen the feeling of distrust against the United States and that his country is not going to leave its nuclear weapons alone under such conditions.
R. Yong Ho said at the annual general meeting of the global organization that North Korea had received "significant good will measures" in the past year, e.g. the cessation of nuclear and ballistic tests, the decommissioning of nuclear testing facilities and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such conditions there is no way to start our disarmament alone."
While Rei repeated a well-known report by North Korea on the resistance of Washington to the possible "static" approach to depuration, according to which North Korea will be paid as it progresses progressively in the process, its statement was important that it did not completely exclude depuration, as did Pionging in the past.
Ri referred to the public announced by Kim Young Won and Donald Trab at the first summit meeting held between an active president of the United States and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on "repurchasing the Korean territory", while Trab promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea seeks to officially end the Korean war from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said that Pionging must first "break" its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted the appeals for the release of the severe international sanctions imposed in North Korea.
"The U.S. is insisting on "first nuclearisation" and is increasing the pressure by threatening with sanctions to achieve their goal by exorcising, even putting obstacles to the "war's end" declaration," Ri said.
"The idea that punishments can cause us is a dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continued punishments deepen our dissatisfaction."
Rei did not make any reference to a planned second summit between Kim and Trab, which the US leader pointed out to the United Nations earlier this week.
However, the minister noted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Mun Je-in in the last five months and added: "If the partner on the issue of nuclearisation was South Korea and not the US, the nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such an inconsistency."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from yesterday, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the goal of the U.S. Homeland with North Korea's ballistic missiles was inevitable because the Bad President Trab called Kim "a fireman" in a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, the Tribe, who threatened last year to "completely destroy" North Korea, has chosen Kim's body for his courage to move forward with disarmament measures, but has said that there must be still much to be done and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is detonated.
On Wednesday, Trab said he had no timetable for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia support that the UN Security Council should reward Piñang for the measures it has taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue intensely and indiscriminately until complete, final and confirmed nuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously approved the sanctions for North Korea since 2006 in an effort to neutralise the financing of Punjanging's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri at the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Piñang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeii has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Piñang in July, saying he had made progress, to be accused by North Korea a few hours later that he had "the demands of a gangster".
North Korea was committed to meeting with Mun this month to decompose a nuclear facility and also a nuclear assembly, if the United States were "comparable measures".
He explained that Kim told him that the "anti-measures" he was seeking were security guarantees that Trab promised to Singapore and were promoting the reconciliation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are following lessons on how to get enough rest.
This year, a new study at Harvard University seeks all the progressive students to sleep more in an effort to combat the growing mass culture of the night study with the consumption of a lot of caffeine.
One academic found that students at the number 1 university in the world often do not know basic things, such as how to care for themselves.
Charles Chasler, Professor of Medical Respiration at Harvard Medical School and a specialist doctor at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, planned the lesson, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the lesson after a talk about the effects of sleep loss on learning.
"In the end, a girl came and said, "Why do I know about this right now in my last year?"
He said that no one had ever talked to her about the importance of sleep - something that surprised me," he said in The Telegraph newspaper.
The lesson, which started for the first time this year, explains to the students the basic principles of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performances, as well as to improving general well-being.
Paul Barry, Professor of Psychology at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University's Health Services, said that the university decided to include the lesson when it was found that students were falling asleep within the week to an important extent.
The fine lesson includes a series of interactive works.
In one unit there is the image of a student student, where students click on cups of coffee, shirts, sports shoes and books to inform about the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performances are affected by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of sleep routine.
In another unit, participants learn how long-term sleep withdrawal can increase the risk of inflammation, brain, depression, and cancer.
A map of the university, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the conduct of the students directly.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects when you choose to smoke," added Professor Chaisler.
His culture to be proud of because you've been studying all night is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students means that getting out of sleep is a problem that's being pushed.
A lot of sleep, good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of the students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, as sleep loss puts the brain in a state of liquefied state, resulting in a permanent feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in chemistry and physics, helped Professor Chasler to design the lesson, having observed one of his classes last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said his class opened his eyes and inspired him to take a lesson across the university.
The next step, hopefully, is to ask all graduate students to monitor a similar programme before starting their studies at this particularly competitive educational institution.
Professor Chasler advised students to set up an alert for the time they should go to sleep, as well as a wake-up alarm, and to know the harmful consequences of the blue light emitted by electronic displays and LED lighting, which can decelerate the rickshaw rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston - Rangers 1-0: Menga puts the ball on Gerard's men
The Rangers had another sad case out of the ground, as Dolly Menga's suite led Stephen Jarard's disoriented side to a 1-0 case in Livingstone.
The Ambrox team wanted to mark its first victory out of the back of February with the 4-1 in St. Johnstown, but Gary Holt's team caused the only second suit of Gerard in 18 games as a coach, leaving the team eight degrees behind the Cards, which is the first in the ranking of the Ladbrokes Championship.
Menga hit seven minutes before the mid-year, and Rangers' inconceivable restaurant seemed unable to respond.
While Rangers is now falling to sixth position, Livingstone is climbing up to third, with just one gall of difference from the Hibernian that's been preceding.
And the Rangers can expect other trouble, as the superintendent Calum Spence needed to get first aid for injury to the head caused by an object that was thrown out of the floor.
Gerald made eight changes in the composition of the team and destroyed Air in the semi-finals for the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same composition "Live 11" that took a degree from the Card last week and would be happy with how this cooled machine could drown every effort of the opponents.
Rangers may have ruled in possession, but Livington did more with the ball.
He should have scored in the second minute, when Mengka's first fart sent Scott Pittman into Alan McGregor's area, but the media didn't find the ball.
A deep free suite of Kigan Jacobs found chief Craig Halket, but his opponent Alan Lithkou's only defense was to send the ball away from the dock.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in the game in the last three.
Alfredo Morellos certainly believed that he should have won a pen at 15', as he fought Steven Loules, but Detective Stephen Thompson ignored Colombian's insults.
The Rangers had only two shots in the area in the first half of the year, but the ex-terminal of Ibrax, Liam Kelly, didn't worry at all about the head of Lasana Kulimpaly and Ovi Ejaria's submarine.
Even though Livi was clearly below expectations in the first 34 minutes of the match, no one can deny that he was worth the effort.
And again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' problem.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball at Scott Robinson, who kept his cold and found Manga who just finished the effort.
Gerard made changes in the middle of the year by pulling Kulmpaly and putting Ryan Kent in. The change almost immediately, as the extremist hit the ball at Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block him.
However, Livingstone continued to drag the guests into the style of the game she knows and enjoys, with the Lithkou and Halket to remove one far away after the other.
Holt's side could have increased the difference to the end, but McGregor dealt with Jacobs in the same way, stopping him before Lithkou's attempt from the corner.
Raingers' alternate, Glen Mindton, had another phase for the pendulum to the end, as he fought Jacobs, but still Thompson ignored it.
Almanak: Gaiger cash collector
A page from the Ammanak Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882: like today, 136 years ago and BALE ... the day that the future natural John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, which eventually led to the device that is now known as the Geiger meter.
In the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with the top players of the incredible cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Andras: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, used to detect radioactive metal elements such as the sky.
When you wear these hearings, you hear the action of people caused by radiation in the metal elements."
Evans: "Look, it's like crazy!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, the invention bearing his name continues her work.
New ante-carcinoma vaccine teaches the immunosuppressive to "see" the problem cells
A new ante-carcinoma vaccine teaches the immunosuppressant to "see" the problem cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immunosuppressive to identify the problem cells in the treatment
The method includes the export of immunocellulars from the patient and their modification to the laboratory
They can "see" a protein that is common to various types of cancer and then be reinjected.
A test vaccine has expected results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received treatment with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize the problem cells saw the cancer of her ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes the export of immunocellulars from the patient, the modification of them in the laboratory so that they "see" a protein common in many cancers, which is called HER2, and then the reinjection of the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofski, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "The results show that we have a very hopeful vaccine in our hands."
As Professor Berzofski explained, the HER2 protein "is the motor force for the development of several types of cancer", such as breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and gut cancer.
A similar approach that exports immunosuppressants from patients and then "studies" how to target cancer cells has been used to treat a type of leukaemia.
Kanie West defended the Trab, wearing a hat with the MAGA belt, after his appearance in SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanie West was awarded a studio during a Saturday night live after a foreign interview with US President Donald Trab and said he would run a candidate in the 2020 elections.
After presenting his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he wore a baseball hat with the slogan Make America Great Again (To do America's big one again), gave a referendum against the Democratics and reiterated his support to the Tribe.
"I talk to a white man many times and he says to me, "But how do you like the Trab?
If I was worried about racism, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL opened with a sketch of Matt Damon, with Hollywood's star, to record Bret Kawano's statement before the Court Committee of Georgia on Christine Blazey Ford's complaints about sexual abuse.
Although it was not broadcast, the video with West's cover went on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to frame West with this suspension.
Also, West protested to the public that he was not well behaved in the parades because of his hat.
"They made me bowling in the squares.
They said, "Don't come out with the hat."
They made me a bowling!
And they say I don't know what's happening to me," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "I don't know what's happening to me, I'll wear the Superman's coat, so no one can tell me what to do.
Try love."
His comments were acknowledged at least twice by the public, and SNL's factors seemed to be in a difficult position, said Variety, with a person saying in the magazine: "The whole studio had a dead end."
West was called a replacement of the last moment of the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, had disappeared a few days earlier.
West confused several when he sang I Love It dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West supported Kantas Turner, head of the TPUSA conservation team, who quoted as saying, "Before one of the bravest spirits: IN THE EYHARISTER OF THE HOLE".
However, the show's show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just "his own self and that's wonderful".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his "art") who believes that he is embedded and exhibits ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So do we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he's now "the one who was previously known as Kanie West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Deedie's steps, also known as Paf Deedy, Pafi and P. Deedie.
The rapper Snup Doug had changed his name to Snup Lion and, of course, the legend of the Prince of Music had changed his name first to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince (the artist once known as Prince).
A category of attempted murder to attack a knife at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old was charged with attempted murder after a knife attack on a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Balichamor, according to the police.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Prosecutor's Office.
The Star of the Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, criticises the toxic arthropodity
Keith Harington is known for the role of John Snow in the violent middle-class fantasy series of HBO, the Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor condemns the stereotype of the hero, saying that such roles on the screen pass on to the little boys the message that it should be hard to win respect.
Speaking in The Sunday Times Culture magazine, Keith said that "something goes wrong" and wondered how the problem of toxic fertility can be fought in the time of #MeToo.
Keith, who recently married his partner at the Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted to having a "strong view" on the matter.
"Personally, now, I believe it very much, where did we make the mistake of inability?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up about the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can partly be responsible for increasing the toxic fertility due to the undesirable characteristics promoted.
He went on, "What is implanted and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets, making young boys feel that they must show such behavior to be men?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time.
There's certainly something wrong with our young people."
The interview also admitted that it did not intend to play at any prequel or sequel of the Game of Thrones, after the end of the series next summer, saying "end in battles and horses".
Since November, Keith will be taking the lead in reviving the True West project of Sam Sephardt, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently discovered that his acquaintance with Rose's wife is the best he's ever had from the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in the series, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from here and beyond," she said.
Rose was in love with Eegrith, John Snow's in love with Keith's in love with Emmy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in the family village of Lesley in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
In the country, more than 820,000 people are affected, according to health services.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new fractures were reported.
In their overwhelming majority, the new fractures were transmitted through sexual contact, marking a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China due to contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had almost disappeared, as leaders of the Chinese health sector had said at a conference in the province of Yunan.
However, compared with the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a very serious issue for the Laos community in China.
Homophily was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination at the expense of the LOAT community remains a common phenomenon.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of these diseases are due to insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised global access to anti-HIV drugs in an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters accuses an expert of breaking the data of Republican seniors, condemning the "dangerous lies" and the "consensual theories"
This Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters questioned the claims that a member of her staff published personal information by three Republican elders on the websites of the legislature's Wikipedia.
The Democratic Member of Los Angeles has argued that the claims were promoted by commentators and websites of the "right side".
"Littles, lies, and even more terrible lies," Waters reported on her Twitter statement.
The published information is intended to include the housing addresses and phone numbers of the mayors Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hats of Juta.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and seems to have been published by an unknown person from the Capitol Hill environment during the hearing of the Committee of Georgia on allegations of sexual misconduct against the candidate for High Court Bret Cavan.
The leak took place at some point after the three guards had questioned the Cavan.
Conservatives, such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the reports was associated with the Waters office and published the data of a member of the Waters staff, reported The Hill.
"This baseless claim is a completely false and outright lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been violated because of these false and false claims, was in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This baseless claim is a completely false and outright lie."
Water's statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, among other things by former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleser.
"This defamation is full of anger," Flesser wrote.
"This shows he has no reason to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't be a traitor.
He must not question the motives of the one who accuses him.
He must be calm and calm."
Flesser seemed to compare his reaction to the criticism of the Democratics for Judge Kawano, who was accused by his critics of feeling very angry at hearing Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who seeks to corrupt Waters in the interim elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's huge if it's true," tweeter.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had notified "the competent authorities and the law enforcement authorities of these false claims".
"We will do everything we can to find those responsible," he continued, "and account for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to any and all my staff members."
Movie critique Johnny English Again Prints - a subtonic spectroscopic film with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit's marks in every new British-style movie, and this seems to apply to this revitalization of the Franchise of comedy-acting movies with hero Johnny English, which started in 2003 with the Johnny English film and came back in 2011 with the Johnny English film: The Return.
Could this humorous self-satisfied matter be how obvious we are to be the new opportunity of the nation's exports?
In any case, the disabled Johnny Ingles with his eyelids was able to renew his license to make them a second time. His name states that it is a wider comical creation designed for non-English film viewers.
This is, of course, the Azama secret agent who, while pretending to have the light and the ways of a secret agent, brings a little to Closso, with a dose of "Lord Bin" and something from the guy who played one and only notes on the music theme of the movie The Paths of Light at the opening of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
It is also based on travelling and international mystery men who once drowned Atkinson in Barclaycard's most forgotten TV ads, slamming the chaos in his passage.
There are one or two good times in this last film of JE.
I liked it when Johnny Ingles approached a helicopter dressed in mediocre armor and the elixirs hit his skull.
Atkinson shows his talent in the comedy, however, humour is quite subtle and strange paraphanism, especially when "serious" cinematic franchise such as 007 and Hazardous Missions now contain enough comical data.
The humor seems to address children and not adults, and in my opinion, Johnny Ingles's crazy rides are not as inventive and relevant as the sketches of Ackinson's cotton filmmaker for bin's age.
The eternal central issue is that Britain has a serious problem.
A government hacker has penetrated the super secret online network of British hostages, driving out the identity of all British agents on mission, to the great disappointment of the agent in service, which Kevin Elton is forced to play in a very small role for his well-being.
It is the last drop for a ambitious and ambitious prime minister who is at the forefront of the collapse because of political intelligence: Emma Thompson does what he can best with this character that reminds Teresa May, but the scenario does not help her in particular.
The information advisers shall inform it that, as each active specimen has been discovered, it should return to someone who is armed.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a director at an aristocrat school, but gives inconceivable lessons for secret agents: here are some nice scenes, as England offers an academies of a kind A School of Rock.
England returns to Wythol for urgent information and reunites with Baff's former and sick partner, who is again subject to Ben Miller.
Baff is now married to a midwife, a crazy role in which Vicki Perdín is not fully exploited.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the Gaffa for the Secret Service of this Magnificent are returning to action, meeting the beautiful and generous Ophelia Boulevatova that Olga Kirilenko is subject to.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is fascinated by the daring billion-dollar technology that claims to be able to solve Britain's technological ills: the threatening Jason Volta, whom Jake Lacey is subjected to.
England and Baff begin the density of their pharocomoma: transformed as servants, set fires in a quiet French restaurant, cause chaos as they attempt to smuggle illegally into the luxury yachts of Volta, and England causes anarchy as it tries to use a virtual reality device to familiarize itself with the interior of Volta's home.
All the tricks are used on this last scene, but as sweet and pheasant as it is, it continues to remember a little child television.
Half things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I wonder: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he will really grow up with his talent?
The workers report that they are considering a plan to work for the British quarter, but to be paid for the fifth quarter.
Jeremy Corbin's Working Party is going to consider a radical plan to work the British four days a week, but to be paid for five-year work.
The party, according to information, seeks to entrust the company’s owners with the savings achieved through the restoration of artificial intelligence (AI) to workers, giving them an additional day off.
Thus, workers will enjoy a three-day weekend, without a reduction in their wages.
Sources indicate that the idea coincides with the economic agenda and the party's plans in order to return the balance for the workers.
The change in four-day week was approved by the Congress of Labour Councils in a way that benefits workers from the changing economy.
A higher source than the Working Party said in The Sunday Times: "A change of policy is expected before the end of the year.
"It won't happen in one night, but the four-day work week is a ambition that is driven by the group's approach to rebalancing the economy for workers, as well as its overall strategy for industry."
The Working Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its overall pre-election campaign in 2017.
However, this vision is currently not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A representative of the Working Party said: "The four-day working week is not a party's policy and is not considered by the party".
The secretary of the shadow government, John McDonnell, used the Labour Conference last week to develop his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power by the "personal directors" and the "profit-makers" in the joint ventures.
The plans of the secretary of the shadow government also mean that today's shareholders in the water companies may not take their full share back, as a potential labour government could make 'observations' due to suspected losses.
It also confirmed the plans for the placement of employees in the company's administrative boards and the creation of mutual participation funds to give 10% of private sector companies to employees who will receive annual shares of up to 500 English branches.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking at the 60-minutes show about whether the FBI investigation for Kavano could change their opinion.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kawano has delayed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the decisions of the service could affect some Republican authorities to withdraw their support.
At his Sunday interview, Scott Pelley, a 60-minute broadcast responder, asked Republican journalists John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could derail anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy showed up more openly than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, I do," said Kennedy.
"I said that by going to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavano.
I called him after the incident, when the complaint came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was an amethyst, determined, accused."
However, Graham's vote seems not to change.
"I have decided on Brett Kavano and it will take some explosive category to change my mind," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett refused it strongly," Graham added, referring to Christine Blazey Ford.
"And whoever has named it can't confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I can't see it changing anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how much has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a rich program and packed stars, as well as an equally impressive mission: eradicating global poverty.
For seven years now, tens of thousands are expected to flock to the Great Lawn of Central Park in the context of the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Saint Mentes, but also to be sensitive to the real goal of the event, which is the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international pressure group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of those who are actively fighting it.
In order to ensure a free ticket to the event (except if they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), interested parties had to complete a series of missions or "actions", as volunteers say, send an email to a world leader, call or find other essential ways to help raise awareness about their goal of poverty eradication.
But how successful is Global Citizen, while remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of reparation with a free concert the appropriate way to convince our fellow citizens to take action or is it just another case of so-called "cliativism" when some feel that they really make the difference by signing an electronic request or by sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen Group has reported that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" than its supporters, promoting a number of different objectives.
It reports that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies corresponding to more than $37 billion, which will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and notifications as a result of these actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been disbursed or concentrated.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British association of investors and contractors, who have undertaken to "help children to fully exploit their potential", promising to give Rwanda 35 million dollars to eliminate the bribery, having received more than 4,700 tweets from members of the Global Citizens community.
"With the support of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizens community like you, we can make the social injustice of subsistence a sub-record in history," Tracy Ulman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told the public during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, following the 5,000 actions and now calling on the United Kingdom to improve food for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project called The Power of Nutrition, which is directed at 5 million women and children with food interventions.
Answering the question "What makes you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?" which is included in the frequently asked questions on the website,
a member of the Global Citizen community replied: "The road will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like all the big moves for human rights and against it in front of us, we will succeed because we are more united.
Janet Jackson, Wicked, St. Minds, Cardie B and Janel Mona are some of the artists that will appear in the New York this year's event, which will be presented by Debora-Li Farnes and Hio-Jackman.
The US can use the Navy for "exclusion" by preventing Russia's energy exports - Minister of Interior
Washington can turn "if necessary" into its Navy to prevent the availability of Russian energy in the markets, including the Middle East, as US Minister of Interior, Ryan Zinke revealed, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where it operates following a call from the legitimate government, is a light for the investigation of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reasons why they are in the Middle East are that they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern and South Europe," he said according to information.
According to the Minister, there are ways and means to deal with Russian activity.
"The United States has the opportunity, with the support of the Navy, to ensure that sea routes remain open and, if necessary, to exclude them, to ensure that Russian energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants in the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is described as the "consumer's voice" in the United States.
He agreed on Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are essentially the same.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is, a little bit, the use and replacement of fuels," said a Russian-mentioned characterist, "who knows only one trick," as he has a fuel-dependent economy.
The statements were made as the Trab administration has taken the mission to strengthen exports of American liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the cheapest choice for European consumers.
For this reason, the administration of the Trab, including President Donald Trab himself, is trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "appropriate" work for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to the Trab, will make Berlin a "capable" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2, a 11 billion-dollar budget project, which is going to double the existing capacity of the treatments into 110 billion cubic measures, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington’s severe opposition to the project is driven for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the gas supplier they want," said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Minister of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States led to the reaction of Germany, which stressed its commitment to the implementation of the project.
Germany's top industrial organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the US to withdraw from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country intervenes in our energy supply," said Ditter Kembf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Valdimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider declaring candidate for the presidency in 2020, says Masahushetti's governor
Masahushetti's mayor, Elizabeth Warren, said Saturday that he would seriously consider declaring a candidate for the Presidency after the mid-term elections.
At a meeting in the capital of Holiouk in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the possibility.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and correct our troubled government, and that is why a woman at the top needs to be at the top," The Hill said.
"After 6 November, I will consider the possibility of a candidate for the Presidency."
Warren criticised President Donald Trab during the meeting, saying that "he leads the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trab does in our democracy," he said.
Warren didn't pick up her words about the Trab and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Bret Cavan.
On a Friday tweet, Warren said that "of course it is necessary to investigate the FBI before the vote".
A publication published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Voren voters do not believe that they should put a candidate for the Presidency in 2020.
58% of the "possible" voters in Massachusetts said that the sponsor should not apply, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% were in favour of such a candidate.
The review showed more support for a possible candidate from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a possible candidate and 48% in favour.
Other popular names from the Democrats who discussed a possible candidate for 2020 are former CEO Joe Baiden and Mayor Bernie Sanders of Bermuda.
Byden said he would have officially decided by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Pilein referred to Trak Pilein's Trak Pilein's Metabolism Strain at Donald Trab's Concentration
Trak Pilein, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after his military in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
"With what my son has been going through since he came back, I can understand other families who live with the effects of the Trauma Stras Disorder and the injuries our soldiers carry when they return to their homeland," he told the public in the context of the Donald Trab concentration in Toils of Oklahoma.
Paulin described his arrest as "a bomb ready to explode" and said about her son and other veterans that "they come back a little different, return harder, return wondering if there is respect for what soldiers, aircraft and any other member of the army have done for the country".
He was arrested on Monday in Waisilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, an intervention in relation to domestic violence and armed robbery while he was in a moderate state, according to Dan Benet, a representative of the police department of Waisilla.
18 states and the region of Colombia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the region of Colombia support a legal challenge to the new US policy that refuses to provide asylum to victims trying to escape from partnerships or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the region submitted a report to friends curiae on Friday in Washington, supporting an asylum applicant to question politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the strike in Greece v. Session, submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union, has not been revealed in August against federal policy.
She said her partner "and his violent sons who are members of the community" abused her, however, US officials rejected her request for asylum on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
Citizens' lawyers who support Greece described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum-seekers in the United States come as countries that are facing intense problems with partnerships and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision taken by the Immigration Commission (IAB) and allowed undeclared immigrants from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General of Colombia, Carl Rasin, said Friday that the new policy "is unknown to all decades of civil, federal and international law".
"In accordance with federal law, all asylum applications must be considered on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application. Such a collapse violates this principle", in the report friend curiae.
The lawyers also claimed that the policy that refuses entry to immigrants is damaging the US economy, claiming that it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and to "be a necessary workforce".
In June, Judge General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims who were trying to escape domestic violence and compatriots.
"The asylum is available for those who leave the country of origin because of persecution or intimidation because of race, religion, nationality or participation in a particular social group or political opinion," the Session said in his statement on 11 June on politics.
The purpose of asylum was never to alleviate all the problems (even the most serious) people are facing every day in the world.
Unknown rescue efforts in Palus, since the number of dead is doubled over the struggle to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was constantly deteriorating.
"It's very intense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, trying to relieve her baby who had a fever, in a ventilator that had been placed in the destroyed city of Palou.
"Every minute the nurses bring other bodies.
The clean water is spreading."
Some residents have undertaken to return to their ruined homes and to collect their existing ones through the water, trying to reduce what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, which were damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were unable to cover their needs.
Some wounded, such as Dui Harris, who had been in the middle and shoulder ward, stayed outside the Palace Army Hospital, where the first aid was given to the ground because of the ongoing strong movements.
The tears poured down his eyes as he taught how he felt the violent earthquake to shake the room on the fifth floor of the hotel shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I was trapped in the walls," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then she came in silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "exhibiting" with "propagandist advertisements"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a quadruple advertisement in a daily newspaper in the United States, claiming the mutual commercial benefits between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to challenge its propaganda.
The US President Donald Trab reported last Wednesday on China's on-payment billboard Daily, which appeared in Des Moines Register, the newspaper with most sales in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in Congress's elections on 6 November, a category China rejects.
Trab's accusation that Beijing has been involved in the U.S. elections marked what US officials have reported to Reuters that it is a new phase of the escalating campaign launched by Washington in order to exert pressure on China.
Although it is not prohibited for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a escalating trade war and have imposed various duties on imports.
China’s customs crimes at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at wounding exporters in such countries as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of the Trab, reported Chinese and American experts.
Teri Brandand, US ambassador to China and former government with long-term status in Iowa, a state that is an important exporter of agricultural products in China, said that Beijing had hurt US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, as Brandt wrote in an opinion article in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is teaching this kind of intimidation by publishing propaganda advertisements in our free press".
"In an effort to spread this propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting the valuable tradition of freedom of speech and the free press of America, publishing a payment advertisement in Des Moines Register," Brandand wrote.
"On the contrary, in the vicinity of Beijing, you will find minimal delining voices and no real representation of the different views that the Chinese people may have on China's difficult economic path, since the media are under the control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has left the offer to publish" his article, although he did not reveal which.
The Republicans dismiss women voters in the interim elections because of the flag with the Kawano, the analysts warn
As many top Republicans continue to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Cavano despite complaints of sexual abuse, analysts warn that there will be a response, particularly from women, in the next interim elections.
The feelings on this issue are particularly deep and most Republicans have said they would like to proceed with the vote.
These things can't be restored," Grant River, professor of Political Sciences at Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill about an article published on Saturday.
The River doubts that the recent move by Mayor Jeff Fleic (R-Arizona) to ask for an investigation by the FBI will be sufficient to attract the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow, and they will certainly not forget it in November," said Karen Zan-Pierre, senior consultant and national press representative of the MoveOn, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators regularly called the post "November is coming!" on the way to Georgia, as the Republicans who control the Judicial Commission gave the green light for Kavan's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blazey Ford, mentioned Mic.
"Democrats' enthusiasm and motivation will reach record level," said St. Rodenburg, an uncompromising political analyst, on the news website.
"They say it's already high, and that's true.
But it could be higher, especially in the group of unsolved female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29 years who, while opposed to the president, often do not vote."
Even before the Ford's public submission, in which he detailed his complaints of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, the analysts had predicted that there might be a reaction if the Republicans proceed with the money.
"It's a huge mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steel, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the vote in the committee or the final vote or whether Kawano will be put out. It has to do with how the Republicans handled the issue and how it was dealt with," Gai Cecil, director of the Group of Priorities USA, pointed out in a news channel that assists in the election of the Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe after Fort and Cabano's statements, moving slightly more in favour of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents were sure or probably believed in Ford's deposit, while 35% said they were sure or probably believed in Kavano.
In addition, 38% said that he believed that Kavano probably or certainly lied to his position, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Fleic's move, the FBI began to investigate Ford's complaints and at least another complainant, Debora Ramirez, told The Guardian.
Last week, Ford filed a plea before the Justice Committee of Georgia that Kawano attacked her while she was drunk when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her her births while she was at a party, when both were studying in Gail in the 1980s.
World's Designer plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Burns Lee, the inventor of the World East, starts a startup aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new point of this legend of technology is Inruptt, a company based on Burns Lee's open Solids platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data will be stored, as well as who can have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Burners Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt is the "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology by allowing users to create their own "personal electronic storage space" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, work lists, journals, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify to be all available in a browser and all at the same time.
The unique feature of the personal data storage area is that it allows the user to decide who has access to such information.
The company calls this option "personal power through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is the company to offer resources, procedures and appropriate skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is made up of Burns Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some concerted programmers who worked in the work and a community of volunteer programmers coders.
Since this week, technology programmers around the world can create their own focused applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners Lee said that he and his team didn't talk to Facebook and Google about whether they were allowed to make radical changes, blocking business models in one night.
"We don't ask for permission."
In a publication in the Medium released on Saturday, Burners Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on the basis of Solid platform".
In 1994, Burners Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Technology Institute of Massachusetts (MIT).
In recent months, Burners Lee has had a strong voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even with the Inrupt, Burners Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic about the next time on the Internet," Burners Lee added.
Bernard Van: Price tax on inheritance received by the Victorian Stock Exchange in World War I
The only heir of the Anglican Church who has received the Victorian Stair during the A' World War as a soldier was honored in the home of 100 years later.
Deputy Admission Officer Bernard Van received the metal on September 29, 1918, for the attack on Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a free man four days later and never learned that he had left the highest British military division.
On Saturday, the discoveries of a memorial plaque were made by his two grandchildren, who were accompanied by a passage to the Northhamptonshire Rasden.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "excellent symbol" that the discovery of the plaque was made exactly 100 years after his grandfather's heroic act for which he received the metal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Anti-Constable Van led his team to the Canal of St. Kent in a very dense mist, and he was given a strong gun and a multi-stakeoff."
Later, he jumped into the front line and with "excellent manhood" led the line forward before he hit himself with a weapon of battle three of the wreckage.
Counter-Chairman Van was killed by a German freeman on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's heroic actions were "something I know I could never get to, it's something that makes you feel immeasurable respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also deposited a rock after the passage led by the new Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said that "he felt a great deal of honor in the passage" and added that "the manhood of a real hero is proved by the support he has of many people."
MMA's fans have stayed to watch Bellator 206, but they saw Peppa the Furonaki.
Consider the following scenario: You've been staying to watch the exciting Bellator 206, but you're looking forward to seeing this unique sport event.
The program in San José included 13 matches, including six on the main card, and would live in the United Kingdom, from Channel 5, to the night zone.
At 6:00 p.m., as Gegard Mussisi and Rory McDonald were preparing to go out in the ring, the audiences in the United Kingdom remained tight when the show changed Peppa to Huronaki.
Some were not happy at all, as they had stayed awake until the first morning especially for the fight.
A Twitter fan described the show as "some kind of sick joke".
"In accordance with the legislation, this content was not suitable for 6 a.m., so the children's programme should be planned," said Dave Svarts, Senior Marketing and Bellator's communication vice president, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa the Furonaki, in fact."
Bellator's president, Scott Koker, said that they are going to process the programme to include future UK viewers.
"If we think about the tires, I think we can do it," said Koker.
"But there are six Sunday mornings there and we won't be able to do it until our Sunday time, i.e. their own Monday.
But we're trying.
Believe me, when the change happened, a lot of messages were exchanged back and forth and it wasn't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
It wasn't, it was because of the rules.
I promise you, next time, it's not gonna happen.
We're going to limit it to five matches instead of six, as we usually do.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Dale felt "more" because of his sexuality
Olympiacus in the collapses, Tom Dale, said that he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, however, it moved him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until the high school that "they're not all like me."
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Lavern on Radio 4, he said he supported the rights of homosexuals to give the other "hope".
He also said that since he became a parent, he had less interest in winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Yang, a regular presentation of known radio broadcasts, was for several months on leave due to illness.
As invited to Lavern's first show, Dale said he felt "insufficient" compared to others when he was growing up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like someone and boys and girls".
He said, "To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity have given me the strength and desire to achieve."
He wanted to prove it was "something," he said, so he wouldn't let anyone down when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The second time a galkino olymbinicus is a defender of the rights of the LOCK community and has taken advantage of its participation in this year's Community Games in Australia in order to call for more countries to move forward in the criminalization of homosexuality.
He said he decided to talk, because he felt lucky that he could live openly, without any impact, and that he wanted to give other "hope".
Three times a world champion said "it was a surprise" when a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lans Black, was in love with him in 2013.
Dale got married last year to Oscar Dustin Lance Black, who is 20 years older than him, but supported that the age difference never existed.
"When you spend so much at such a small age" (he first participated in Olympic Games at the age of 14, while his father died of cancer three years later) "it's hard to find a companion who has similar good and bad times."
The couple adopted a son in June, Robert Ray Black-Dale, and Dale said he changed "all his perspective".
"If you asked me last night, all I wanted was to win the gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than gold Olympic metals.
My gold olipine metal is Robby.
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Dale said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether he had taken tickets to the 2012 Olympics in London, as he wanted to be in the first series.
"I couldn't tell him "Dad, you wouldn't be close to us to sit in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and only when he stopped breathing and was already dead did I finally accept that he was not infidel," he said.
The following year, Daily competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the calcinic metal.
"I knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life, fighting the defeats of the Olympic Games in my home country, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of the first song, the Proud of Heather Small, which inflamed him during his preparation for the Olympic Games and still causes him to abstinence.
Desert Island Disks broadcasts on BBC Radio 4, every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The outside Mikelson will be sitting on the ice on Saturday at Ryder Cup
American Phil Michaelson will record a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match at Ryder Cup, but he will have to improve his performance so he doesn't remember him for the wrong reasons.
Mikelson, who attends the 12th time (number of record) in the two-year-old competitions, was required by Chief Jim Furick to sit on the stage for the fourballs and the foursomes on Saturday.
Rather than being at the centre of action, as usual for the United States, the winner five times spent the day worrying about the lines and "working" his game hoping to correct his problems.
Without ever having the most responsible driver even on the ground of his career, the 48-year-old game is not suitable for the narrow area of Le Golf National, where the distant are often difficult.
And as if the difficulty of the field, Mikelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces Francesco Molinari, the British Open champion, who is working with the first appearing Tommy Flidwood to win their four matches this week.
If the Americans, who were four degrees below the start of the 12 singles, can take the lead with a good start, the playing of Mikelson may be crucial.
Furick expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he's playing today, hit me in the back, put his hand around me and said he'd be ready for tomorrow," Furick said.
"He has great self-confidence.
His name is in Hall of Fame and has offered too much in these groups, both in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't count on him to play two games.
I was thinking more, but that's where we ended up and so we thought we should start.
He wants to get out there, like everyone else."
Michaelson will cross Nick Fallto's record for most Sunday matches at Ryder Cup.
It could mean the end of a career in Ryder Cup that didn't reach the height of his personal record.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 slots and seven and a half, even though Furick said his presence benefited the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's spiritual, he likes to make jokes and he's excellent in the group room," he explained.
"I think the younger players were also having fun with him this week, and it was funny to see it.
His contribution is not just in the game."
The leader of the European Group, Thomas Byrne, knows that the great advance can soon be lost.
Thomas Byron, the leader of the European team, knows from his experience that a great advance that starts from the singles of the last day to Ryder Cup can easily be turned into a bed.
Danus made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama game, where a team led by Sever Balesteros managed to take advantage of five degrees against the Americans, but he just managed to cross the finish line with a difference in his brain, winning 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
"You always remember that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just after we were violent," Beorn said, in the picture, following the generation of 2018, to win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and lead 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So the story will show to me and all the members of the team that this is not over.
We're going to be ready tomorrow to give it all.
We'll get out there and play right.
Nothing's finished until you see the grades on the table.
We have a goal, to win this troupe, and that's where we focus.
I always say that I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we know very well that in the other team there are also good players – the best in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Beorn adds: "I would not rush to predict the result.
Tomorrow's another animal.
Tomorrow measures individual performance and this is something different.
It's great to be in the field with a player when things go well, but when you're out there alone, then you're trying all your skills as a golfer.
This is the message you have to convey to players, how to get the best out of them tomorrow.
You leave your partner behind, and he has to give it all and show himself the best."
Unlike Byron, Jim Furick from the opposing team will ask his players to score better individual performances than those they had with their partners, except for Jordan Spyt and Justin Thomas, who won three degrees from the four.
Furick himself has survived both the end of the last day's revolutions, as he belonged to the winning group in Brooklyn before the unexpected fall, as Europe did her miracle.
"I remember every rhyme of his word," he answered when asked how Ben Crenso, chief in 1999, had pushed his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want a quick start like Brookline, like Medina.
When we get this string, there's a lot of pressure in the middle races.
We decide our series accordingly and we play with the series that hits us, we will try to do our magic tomorrow."
Thomas has taken the lead in the game and is dealing with Rory McCillroy at the top of the game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flidwood and Ian Pauler, the rest of Europe in the top half of the series.
"I went with this group with this series because I think it covers the whole route," Byron said, justifying his choices for the singles.
New reference for the new German warship
The new German Navy fleet should have been put into service in 2014, to replace the old warships of the post-war era, but it will not be taken up until at least next year, due to poor systems and forced costs, the local media report.
The position in service of the Rhineland-Pfalz Freight, the fleet of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has been suspended until the first six months of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which is called on a representative of the armed forces.
The ship should have joined the Navy War in 2014, but the problems with the tradition were crucial to the success of the ambitious plan.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships ordered by the Marine War in 2007 will replace the oldest Bremen class brakes.
They will bring strong rules, a series of anti-aircraft missiles and missiles against ships, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, overheads and acoustic signatures.
Other important features are that the frequency of maintenance work is reduced, as the use of new flakes for up to two years outside German ports will be possible.
However, the ongoing delays mean that even if warships are considered the latest technology, which will allow Germany to demonstrate its power abroad, until they are finally put in service, they will be already overdue, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 brake became the first page last year, when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss ship in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the ship after the delivery.
Not much information on the reasons for the return has been made known, but the German media reported a series of significant "commitments with software and material" that would be used in the warship in vain if they were used in a war mission.
The software's problems were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships have about 120 sailors, just half compared to the oldest Bremen class brakes.
It was also discovered that the ship has a much larger weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
The 7 000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz fleet believes it has the double weight of similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to poor equipment, the cost of the whole project (including payment training) was also a matter.
It is said that it reached the approximate amount of EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion), while the original budget was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems facing the new brakes are particularly important since the German maritime force is being shaken.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bardels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy Warship "will soon have no ship for missions".
The officer said that the problem had been solved over time, because the old ships had been landed, but there were no other ships to replace them.
It was claimed that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class brakes could join the Navy.
The National Trust hides the secret life of nightfalls
A new research carried out in a village in the Hills of Scotland seeks to discover how nightfalls use the site when hunting for their food.
The results will shed new light on the behaviour of these single-sealed mammals and will contribute to the design of future actions for the protection of the environment.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will explore the habits of the common tanning and microning, as well as the coffee octopus and the dobington mystics in the Inverewe Gardens, in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the field to monitor nightlife activities throughout the season.
NTS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations using hand detectors.
The analysis of the sound of all recordings by experts will determine the frequency of nighttime calls and what types of behaviour they have.
A biosite map and a report will then be created to form a detailed picture of their behaviour on a local scale.
Rob Diuar, a natural environmental consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are more important to the nights and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and the best way to keep forests for nightfalls and other relevant species.
The nightlife populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have fallen significantly since the last century.
They stem from the construction and development projects that affect the areas where they plant and destroy their habitats.
Respiratory and photosensitivity are also dangerous, as are adhesive films for flies and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by insect cats.
Nocturnals are not really blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes to catch their food.
They use an advanced sound detection technique to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land all over the country, considers nightlife very important.
He has ten trained experts, who carry out regular investigations, inspect the areas where nightfalls are coerced and sometimes rescue them.
The organisation has also created the first and only refuge of Scotland exclusively for nightlifes in Thrave, Damfris and Galoway, where eight of the ten species live in Scotland.
The farm manager, David Thompson, says that the farm is the ideal land for nightfalls.
"Here at Thrave we have an excellent nightlife area," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many big trees and an ideal habitat.
There are still many who do not know about the nights, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what they need to increase their populations."
It points out that it is important to have first control of the presence of nights before every household maintenance work, as the destruction of one and only small nests could kill up to 400 women and children, possibly eliminating the entire local population.
Nightfalls are protected species and it is forbidden to kill them, disturb them, or disturb their peace, or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferel, a member of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, encouraged the public to offer his help.
He said, "There is much left to learn about our nights and many of our species we just don't know the evolution of their population."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape, as his lawyers are preparing to report a German magazine
Christian Ronalto described complaints of rape against him as "fake news", saying that some "want to self-proclaim" exploiting his name.
His lawyers are going to announce the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the complaints.
The attacker of National Portugal and Thursday is accused of raping an American named Kathryn Majoorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the complaint, she was brought to pay $375.000 to buy her silence and not mention anything about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking on a live video in Instagram at 142 million followers after the complaint, Ronalto, 33, described the reports "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," Gold Ballas winner said five times in the camera.
"They want to be self-inflicted and exploit my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous using my name, but that's part of my job.
I'm happy and everything's good," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to report Der Spiegel on the claims he published, which they described as "an unacceptable report of reputations affecting private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "ethical damage due to the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of private life in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
After being introduced to a nightly entertainment centre, Ronaldo and Majoorga returned to the player's room, where he was brought to violence by nature in accordance with documents submitted to the Clark Regional Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell into his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99 percent" of one "the same guy", but he betrayed the other "one percent".
The documents say that Ronaldo admits that they had sexual intercourse, but that she was consensual.
Magiorga also claims that she went to the police and to a hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to an extrajudicial arrangement, because she "was afraid of the possible antidotes" and worried about her "public execution".
The 34-year-old says she's trying to reverse the arrangement, as she continues to suffer from a metabolic syndrome due to the alleged incident.
Ronalto was eager to receive a transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester Union in the time of alleged abuse, and this summer he moved to the Italian Youth by ensuring an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will regret the loss of cars forever"
The United Kingdom "will regret it forever", if it loses its reputation as a world leader in the car industry after Brexit, Minister of Enterprise Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car industry said that the impact of cross-border delays in Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The factory in Bernston, where the models Auris and Avensis of Toyota are built, supplied nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will cease," said Marvin Cook, Director-in-Chief of Toyota in Bernston.
Other cars in the United Kingdom have also expressed fears about leaving the EU without agreement on cross-border trade, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has stated that it will close Mini's factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems concern risks in the supply chain according to the car industry in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line follows just-in-time. Exchanges come every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the United Kingdom and the EU for cars manufactured by order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be problems at the borders, resulting in delays and lack of resources according to the industry.
It would have been impossible for Toyota to keep a stock more than a day at her factory in Derbysair, the company said, so production would stop.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa May's plan for the future relationship with the EU "is working specifically to resolve the issue of cross-border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want the best possible agreement that will allow us not only a temporary success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," said the BBC Radio 4 today.
"The elements that come not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers are that it is necessary to ensure the continuity of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how much money would stop production, however, warned that long-term additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Chuvalaris, who has been working in Bernston for 24 years and is the union's trade officer at the factory, said that members of the body are increasingly concerned: "From my experience, if these jobs are lost, they will never return.
A government representative said: "We have presented an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trab's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, White House announces
Donald Trab's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can "delay another week", as the fight for the candidate in the Supreme Court, Bret Kavano, announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Specialist Roger Miller, who investigates the Russian intervention in the elections, the Trab's assistants' links with Russia and the possible interference of justice by the president.
It is possible that Trab will fire the Deputy Attorney General, endangering Miller's independence, feeding Washington's battalions for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had debated the possibility of putting his talks with the Trab to record and that the president's removal on the basis of the 25th Amendment was possible.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
Last Monday, however, he moved to the White House through reports that he was going to resign.
On the other hand, a meeting with Trab was announced on Thursday, which was then in the United Nations Organization in New York.
Trab said he would " prefer" not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed in order not to coincide with the hearing procedure before the Committee on Judicial Affairs of Georgia, which was placed both by Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaze Ford.
On Friday, the Trab ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the claims against Cavan, thus delaying the holding of a vote more than the plenary session.
Sarah Sanders, a Trab type representative, appeared on the Fox News Sunday TV show.
I was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "There has not been a date yet, perhaps this week, but perhaps another week of data for all other cases involving the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I still like to keep the guy informed."
Some journalists have responded to this claim: Sanders has to make type information in the White House since 10 September.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why this is happening.
Sanders replied that the limited frequency of the information was not due to the "printing" movements of TV journalists, although he said, "I will not disagree with the fact that they are being shown".
He then let it be understood that he would increase or direct communication between the Trab and the type.
"The President gives more interviews than any previous president," he said, adding without adding any information: "We looked at these numbers."
They will continue to carry out reports, said Sanders, but "if the guy has the ability to address questions directly to the President of the United States, this is even better than talking to me.
We're trying to apply it often and you've seen that we've been applying it often in the last few weeks and it's going to get the type of information where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trab often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or type interviews with official visitors.
Individual type interviews are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why this is happening, with an anti-conventional and sometimes foreign appearance before assembled journalists.
Minister of Health sends a letter to EU citizens working in the Scottish National Health System through fears about Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to EU citizens engaged in the Scottish National Health System to express the country's gratitude and to wish them to remain even after leaving the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Jean-Friman, Scotland's Member, sent a letter, while less than six months remain to withdraw the United Kingdom from the EU.
The government of Scotland has already committed itself to covering the costs of applications for permanent residence ("setled status") for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Mrs Fryman wrote in her letter: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on departure continued during the summer and lead to expected decisions in the autumn.
However, the UK government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario of non-agreement.
I know that this period must be particularly difficult for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member to non-nationality.
Members from all over the EU and beyond have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercroby undergoes an emergency surgery after a head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers champion, Kristion Abercroby, was subjected to an emergency surgery following a head injury in the Saturday's game, where Tennessee State Tigers were fired with a score 31-27 by Vanderbilt Commodores, as reported by the journalist of Tennessee, Mike Organ.
The chief coach of Tennessee State Rod Red told reporters that the injury occurred just before the mid-year.
"He came to the pond and just fell there," said Rid.
The gymnastics and medical personnel gave Abercroby oxygen to the pond and then put it in a basket and transferred it back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris from the WSMV TV station in Nashville of Tennessee that Abercroby was out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are "not yet any data on the type/extension of injury" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.

He made five total taklins on Saturday before he left the game, thus reaching the 18 total taklins for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher rate of paper for the sale of real estate in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged at a higher rate for the sale of real estate in the United Kingdom, while the additional money will be used to provide assistance to the homeless, according to the new projects in Toris
The measure will neutralise the success of Corbin's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in the paper quota will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Economic Affairs expects it to raise up to 120 million pounds a year - to provide assistance to the guests
Foreign buyers will begin to impose a higher end of paper for the sale of real estate in the United Kingdom, while the additional amounts will be used to provide assistance to orphans, as Teresa May announced today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to break down the success of Jeremy Corbin's campaign to attract young voters with promises of a more economic settlement and to target high wages.
The increase in the paperwork will be imposed on natural and legal persons who are not taxed in the United Kingdom, while the additional amounts will strengthen the government's campaign to combat the lack of shelter.
The increase, imposed at the current end of the paper, together with the highest tax rates introduced two years ago for the sale of second houses and rented houses, may amount to three per cent.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs expects the measure to yield up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of London's new properties are purchased from non-residents in the United Kingdom, leading to an increase in prices and making it more difficult for buyers to enter the first housing market.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "city-beats" because of the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new policy is introduced just a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the paperwork deadline, so that more new people can get their first residence.
He categorised the large construction companies as holding the prices of the real estate, but acquiring land without using it and calling on Mrs May to destroy the platforms in economic housing to restore Britain's "founding thirst".
Mr Corbin has announced a series of impressive proposed rigid reforms, including rental checks and the ban on "no grounds".
He also wants to give more authority to councils to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Yesterday I said that I would devote my prime minister to restoring the British dream - to improving life for every new generation.
This means that the dissolved real estate market is being adjusted.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and companies based abroad to buy homes as easily as hard workers British citizens.
For many people, the dream of housing ownership has become very distant and the lack of shelter is still valid."
Jack Ross: "My absolute ambition is to train the Scotland team"
Santerland's leader, Jack Ross, says his "extreme ambition" is to become a once-in-a-life coach of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scotchézos is excited about the challenge of raising the team of northeastern England, which is currently in the third position in the English League One, three degrees below the top.
He moved to the Light Station in the summer after he had previously referred St. Myren to the Scottish Championship the previous race season.
"I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I received a call for the second national team and that was," Ross told the Scottish BBC on the radio show Sportsound.
"But I grew up looking at the Scottish team in Hamden all the time with my dad as a kid, and that's something he always pulled me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I succeed in training groups."
Among the ancestors of Ross in Santerland is Dick Advokaat, David Moyes, Sam Alardais, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kin, Gas Poyette and Paolo Dji Kanio.
The former coach of Aloa Athletics reports that he did not feel thirsty when he was called to place such established names in such a large group, having previously rejected approaches from Barney and Ipswich Town.
"Now the success for me will be measured on the basis of the answer to the question "can I return this group to Prime Minister Lig?"
Because of the structure and facilities of this group, it belongs undoubtedly to Primer Lig," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'll probably consider myself successful here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross began his career as a coach just three years ago, having spent a period as an assistant coach in Dbarton and a period of 15 months in the training staff of Harts.
Then he helped Aloa come back from the submission to the third category and led St. Myren from the mouth of the submission to win the Championship next season.
Also, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlpool, Folkerk, St. Myren and Hamilton Akantemikal.
"It was probably a real crossroads," said a reminder to take over the position of coach Aloa.
"I really thought he was more interested in me being a coach than a player.
It sounds weird because I was doing well, I was getting decent money out of it, and I got pretty high.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to take a lot on a weekly basis.
I'm still having trouble with the stress and pressure of work, but my coach's work is perfectly fit.
I've always wanted to train and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than I've felt with myself all my life."

The best time for beer is 5.30 μm on Saturdays, according to research
The heat fuel increased the profits for Britain's tested pubs, but brought greater pressure on the chain restaurants.
The pubs and bars saw an increase in sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but restaurant profits decreased by 4.8 per cent, as the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, from the consulting company CGA, which collected the data, said: "The continuous sunlight and the largest of England's expected participation in the World Cup resulted in July following a similar pattern with the previous month, in June, where the profits of the pubs increased by 2.8 per cent, but the restaurants were even more affected.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in restaurant revenue in June simply took over in July.
The pubs and bars serving alcohol have gone far better, with the corresponding figures of previous years being higher than the corresponding figures of restaurants.
The pubs serving food also suffered the sunny days, although not as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like the world just wants to get out for a drink.
In all managed pubs and bars, liquor sales increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while food sales decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, from the RSM company's recreation and hospitality analysis department, said: "These results verify the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors in the field of non-domestic sales.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to find it difficult, but the drop in sales by 4.8 per cent on an annual basis will be particularly painful data on the continued cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have appeared at a worse time for the businessmen at the centre and time would show if the lowest temperatures we have experienced in August would give a sizable extension."
The total increase in sales to pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in trade name launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales index for the United Kingdom pubs, bars and restaurants industry collects and analyzes data on productivity from 47 active groups, with a total turnover of over 9 million pounds in England and represents the industry's established benchmark.
One out of five children keep secret accounts on social media, hidden from their parents
As research reveals, one out of five children - even 11 years of age - keep secret accounts in social media, hidden from their parents and teachers
Research in 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Insta pages in Instagram
This message made the fear of being involved in sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account to show their parents
One out of five children - even 11 years of age - create social media accounts that are kept hidden from adults.
A study in 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Insta false accounts - this is a reference to Instagram photo reporting website.
This news kept the fear of being involved with sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they keep a healthy "main" account to show their parents while keeping private accounts at the same time.
A mother who accidentally found the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenage girl who encouraged others to rush her (“fight me”).
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC in independent schools found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, while half of them admitted to keeping secret accounts.
HMC President Mike Buukanan said, "It is worrying that so many teenagers fall into the temptation to create online places where their parents and teachers cannot identify them."
Elind Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" at the Scottish Foundation Council
Elind Doyle was elected as non-executive adviser to the Scottish Board of Staff at the annual general meeting of the Director.
Doyle is Scotland's most award-winning sportsman, and President Ian Biti has commented on her election as a great opportunity for those who direct the sport to benefit from her wide experience at international level in the past decade.
"Eilind enjoys unhindered respect throughout the Scottish, British and world-class stable community and we are sure that the stable in Scotland will have a huge benefit from its entry to the council," Biti said.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the gold medal at 200 and 400 meters in the Atlantic Olympic Games in 1996, has won a total of four gold Olympic medals and is now a regular commentator at the BBC, remained unsolved after a transient ischaemic stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I was brainwashed.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show if and by how long I'm going to rest.
It was exhausting, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again, and today I'm doing charity exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertisement of a baby girl comparing mothers to cows imparts a common online opinion
A dairy production company has distributed the online common opinion with an advertisement that compares mothers who breast-feed sheep belonging to them.
In order to launch the so-called "world's first restless and portable warehouse", the consumer technology company Elvie has released a humorous video clip advertisement to show the freedom it offers to breast-feeding mothers the new barn.
Four real mothers dance in a herd of sheep filled with ashes, with a song that includes sticks like, "Yes, I belong to myself, but you don't see any tails" and "In case you haven't noticed, these are not mothers, they're my tits."
The dance continues: "Take it, take it, feed it baby, take it, take it, take it, take my ladies."
However, the advertisement, published on the Facebook company's page, has created an online opposition.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, as many say it does not take the "free" of the dairy industry seriously.
"It is a very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to stay pregnant and be born to produce milk, but their own babies steal them a few days after the birth," someone commented.
Elvie's barn puts discernment into a supportive breast (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else said, "Probably painful for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a warehouse for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "A completely out of the truth."
Others defended the ad, while one woman admitted that her song seemed "a hearty."
"I think it's a very clever idea.
I'd buy a treasure like that if I was still a treasurer.
My breath made me feel just like a cow.
The ad's a little old, but I didn't get to overdo it.
It's a clever product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "It's a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who suck mother milk (often at their place of work or in toilets) and feel like "gloves".
It is not advertising that offends or insults the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women's group discovers that everyone danced with the discriminating warehouses located inside their bras.
The logic behind the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who use breast milk say they feel like cows.
But Elvie's barn, however, is completely unbearable, has no cables or tubes and puts discreetly into a bra, allowing women to move, hold their babies and even go out during the blast.
Anna Balarin, partner and Executive Director of Creation at Mother, commented: "The Elvie Theatre is such a revolutionary product that it was worth a bold and challenging launch.
We wanted to focus on the mother’s milk and all the challenges she is facing, while showing the incredible sense of freedom that the new gym will bring.
It's not the first time Elvie has become a first-person hero.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared in the parade for the fashion designer Martha Yakubosky while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved indiscriminately to a settlement on the borders of Texas
The number of migrant children in detention has risen, although the monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trab administration made it more difficult to match children with supporters.
Traditionally, most conservatives are also immigrants themselves without travel documents and are afraid to come out and ask for a child and thus endanger their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk was increased in June when the federal authorities announced that the potential conservators and other adult members of their home should give fingerprints and that the data would be notified to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, senior official of the Immigration and Customs Service, stated to Congress that the service had arrested dozens of people who were asked to maintain unaccompanied minors.
The Service later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had a white criminal record.
"Almost 80 per cent of the people who are either conservatives or members of the household of the conservators are illegal in the country and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
We therefore continue to search for these people," said Mr Albens.
In order to speed up the handling of children's cases, responsible persons have introduced new rules according to which some of these children should appear before a court within one month of the commencement of their detention and not within 60 days, as previously applicable, according to refugee workers.
Many will appear through an icono-televising visit, in the position of the person of appearance, in order to develop their claims for a legal regime before the judge's immigration officer.
Those who feel that they do not meet the conditions for exemption will be removed immediately.
The more children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or tired, which may lead to violent outbursts or attempts to react, according to workers in shelters and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
The colleagues said that these concerns are embedded in larger facilities such as Turin, where indications that a child is being difficult are more likely not to be sensitive because of the size of the facilities.
They added that moving children to the theater without giving enough time to prepare children psychologically or to say goodbye to their friends can aggravate the injury they are already fighting with.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish "powers of possession" to withdraw immediately
Referring to the General Assembly of the United Nations Organization, Foreign Minister Wailid al-Mualem also called on the Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, even though the war in the country is now at the age of eight.
Muslim, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegal in Syrian territory, with the aim of combating terrorism and "will receive appropriate treatment."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said at the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "the war against terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions of others have been expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to "give this sacred war to all Syrian terrorists" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which primarily train and inform both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs opposed to President Basar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the territory of the war-damaged country.
With regard to the refugee issue, Mualem said the conditions are good for their return and accused "certain Western countries" of "disposal of extraordinarily fears" that forced refugees to stay away from their country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicalizing a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for the reconstruction of Syria if political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war is not reached.
The UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a detachmented zone in the last major retaliatory era in Intlib created an opportunity to promote political debate.
The Russian agreement has allowed an extensive attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Mualem, however, pointed out that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target giants, among whom and warriors from the Al-Qaeda Fronto Nusra link, who would "absolute".
The UN Special Envoy, Stefan de Mistura, hopes to soon convene the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to the formation of a post-war regime for Syria and to prepare the way for elections.
Mulem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the committee should be limited to "the revision of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned that no interventions should be made.
Because the Trab will win a second term
In this sense, Mr Trab will win the 2020 elections again, unless, as many liberal spectators probably hope, the motion for a vote and scandals will soon end his presidency.
There is no doubt that it would be "the most dramatic end of the presidency of all ages!"
So far, there are no signs of the spectators' wearyness.
Since 2014, high television numbers have been overcompensated, reaching 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled, reaching 1.6 million in MSNBC.
The Fox News TV network has an average of 2.4 million TVs in the high television area, while four years ago it had 1.7 million, according to Nielsen and the MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" broadcast has reduced television numbers on satellite TV, with 3.5 million TVs on the evenings of important news.
It's a fire that people are attracted to because it's something we don't understand," said Neil Barer, a producer of the drama series ABC "Designed Survivor" where a minister becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Skowell, a veteran comic series writer and book writer entitled "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snaging Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
Remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trab.
He asked, "Why?"
"He answered "Because he makes me laugh"" said Mrs. Scowell.
You can even have fun with chaos.
Of course, unlike what happens to television series, the scenarios coming out of Washington can judge the future of the Roy case against Wade, if the immigrant families can also reunite the world economy.
The change in frequency is a luxury that only the most privileged TV users can enjoy.
But you go beyond the definition of the updated citizen when you're six hours away to watch a team of experts discuss the use of "many interviews in the audience" by Bob Woodward for the book "Fear" ("Fobos"), Paul Manaford's bomber jacket of $15,000 worth of strawberry skin ("a clothes full of copper", according to Washington Post), and the consequences of the brilliant descriptions by Storm Daniels about Mr. Trabb's anatomy.
I, however, will never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"What he does and gives you the feeling of reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brad Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and created the Pawn Stars TV program, about the constantly changing actors and the day-to-day reverses in the Trab show plot (starts fighting with N.F.L., blames Kim Young Won).
You don't have the luxury of losing an incident, otherwise you stay back.
When I met Mr. Flais this week, it was a sunny day with 26 degrees Celsius out of his house on the northern coast of Hawaii, but he was locked in looking at MSNBC while enchanting the CNN.
It could not be off, not when Brett Kavano was to appear before the Committee on Legal Affairs of Georgia and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging by a locker.
"I remember doing those old shows, and the world said, "This will mean the beginning of Western culture," said Mr. Flais.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right at last."

Foreign money enters the most limited re-calculation for the intermediate elections
It is no surprise that the 17th electoral region of Pennsylvania in Congress accepts a flow of money, thanks to the re-directing of the electoral regions of Congress, which has put two active members of Congress candidates for the same position.
This recently redesigned Presiding Region of Pittsburgh is represented by Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who was elected to another region in special elections held last spring.
Lamb has another active representative, Repubblica Keith Rothfus, who represents the former 12th electoral region of Pennsylvania, which is largely associated with the new 17th electoral region.
The maps were redesigned following a decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which in January found that the old regions were being handled in an anti-substantial manner for the benefit of the Republicans.
The re-election in the new 17th electoral region has led to a financial competition campaign between the largest financial segments of the parties, the Democratic Republican Commission for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Commission (NRCC).
Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after winning a final victory in a special electoral reassessment carried out in March, for the 18th election region of Pennsylvania in Congress, which was followed by a lot of people.
This position was held by Republicans for over a decade and President Donald Trab won the region for 20 degrees.
The political analysts give easy progress to the Democrats.
The United States considered the possibility of punishing El Salvador for his support in China, but they did it back.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, causing mild reactions from Washington.
Mr. Trab had a warm meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and maintained a hotel in Panama until the partners removed the management team of the Trab Agency.
State Department officials have decided to reinstate the US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to the "new decisions not to recognize Taiwan" as Hader Nauert, a representative of the service, said earlier this month.
However, the imposition of sanctions was considered only against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received approximately US$ 140 million as US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in economic aid and targeted restrictions on passports, would affect the country of Central America, with high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings developed, North and Central American officials held a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity, as a follow-up to a respective concentration that took place last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent the transition of refugees to the United States.
However, in mid-September, top executives made it clear that they wanted to move forward to the conference, putting an end to the idea of imposing sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pens is going to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, indicating the great importance it has for management, as the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic in peace, without new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal consultations, subject to anonymity.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on the subject of anonymity.
Read History
The next blow may be the report by Special Adviser Robert Miller on the overthrow of justice by Mr Trab, for which very strong evidence has now been published.
It is noted that Mr Miller is also turning his research into possible co-operation between the pre-election campaign of Mr Trab and Russia regarding the Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress changes its hands, Mr. Trab will be held accountable before this body, as he is preparing to re-elect the presidency in the next elections and perhaps finally before the court-martial.
The 'if' is a lot, and I am not surprised that Mr Trab's fall, or his pledges in Europe, is inevitable.
There are options that we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will judge the duration of this battle.
In 1938 German officials were ready to perform a campaign against Hitler, if his West had opposed and supported the Czechoslovakians in Monaco.
We managed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of subsequent killings.
The hearts of history revolve around such points of turn and the inseparable course of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
The Americans are now faced with enough of these fighting points.
What would we do if Mr. Trab fired Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man in his hands at the end of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since it was written in that newspaper that he proposed to be secretly recorded by the president and that he considered him inappropriate for the president's position.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the issue adopted by the Times was wrong.
"How will we respond if the recently requested F.B.I. investigation for Bret Cavano is not complete or fair or if it is assigned to the Supreme Court despite the basic charges for sexual assault and false accusation?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections on a Congress that will put Mr. Trab's account?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will enter a long winter.
But because of the lesson I learned in the Act, I don't think we're going to fail.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was transferred to Auschwitz from the same Nazi regime that he had once arrested in my embassy home.

Graham Dorans of Rangers is a waiter for the battle with Rapid Vienna
Raingers welcomes Rapind Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning the Austrians, after the impressive expedition to Spain with Vietnam earlier this month, will give her a lot of opportunities to move from the 7th European League Group.
A knee injury has prevented Graham Dorans from making his first appearance in the season until a 2-2 football match with Vigaral, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as an asset for greater success.
"It was a good time for us because Violet is a good team," 31-year-old said.
"We went to the game believing that we could achieve something and we went to a degree.
We might be able to escape at the end, but, in general, equalisation was a rather fair result.
It was probably better in the first half, and we were a better team in the second half.
Now, Thursday is another great European night.
Well in fact, we can take three degrees, but it will be a difficult game because they brought good results to their last game, but, with the world on the platform, I am sure we can put our strengths and bring a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult because of my injuries and the changes that have been made to the team itself, but there is a positive feeling now.
The team is good, and the kids enjoy it, the training is good.
Let us hope that we can put our strength now, leave behind the old season and succeed."
Women lose sleep because of their fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the research participants had a clear idea of how they would like to be cared for, few discussed it with their family.
Almost half of the participants in the nationwide research said they were discussing with their spouses the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about this to their children.
"People want to take care of their families, but they don't take the initiative to engage in the relevant debate," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Company.
Start with this.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes much earlier.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will be taken care of, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor may also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your financial options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance at a profit price to help you cover these costs or safety with your own property - enough to have the money.
Write your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes.
Make an expert on health care issues so that you can identify a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that health professionals will comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, collect the possibility to make an informant about your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make decisions on economic matters on your part and ensure that your accounts are paid, if you become unscrupulous.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is facing an emergency health problem and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please report these details to a written design so that you can be ready.

A man took multiple guns with a gun as he walked to his house last night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracob in Devon County, when he was shot in the chest, chest and arm.
The police described the event, which took place at 02:30 British Easter Time, as "a coincidence".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries suffered are not a threat to his life, and the police are calling for witnesses.
Consistency and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palou on Friday, according to official sources, while the number of victims is expected to increase.
With the communication to be interrupted, humanitarian aid forces have failed to receive information from Dongala, a region in the north of Palus, which is closer to the centre of the 7.5-degree magnitude earthquake.
In Palus, more than 16,000 people were removed after the collapse of the destruction.
The following are some important information about Palou and Dongala, in the island of Sulawezi:
Palou is the capital of the province of central Sulawezi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawezi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit it.
Dongala is an anti-Kingdom that extends over 300 kilometers (180 miles) of coastline in the southwest of the island of Sulawezi.
The anti-Kingdom, a level of administrative division under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main support for the economy of the province of central Sulawezi, and especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it meets more in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawezy.
Palou and Dongala have been hit by tsunami several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indian Disaster Management Service.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
Tsunami also hit West Dongala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Seismogenic Firefight in the Pacific Ocean and is often affected by earthquakes.
Some of the largest recent earthquakes and tsunamis are the following:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the province of Atech in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, while more than half were in Atech.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of May and early April.
Hundreds of dead in the island of Nya, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8-degree earthquake in Richter has struck the southern part of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, causing tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.

Sarah Pelin's firstborn son was arrested for domestic violence.
Trak Pilein, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for the presidency Sarah Pilein was arrested for assault.
The 29-year-old Pielin, from the Alaskan Warehouse, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, an obstacle to complaints of domestic violence and opposition to the principle, according to the report published on Saturday by the police (Alaska State Troopers).
According to the police report, when a known woman tried to call the police to complain about the crimes she was committing, she grabbed the phone from her hands.
Pilein is held temporarily in the Mat-Su temporary reservation store, with a guarantee of $500, as mentioned at the KTUU TV station.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he said "sure, innocent" when asked, as the network says.
Paulin faces charges for three A-flights, which means he can be sentenced to imprisonment for up to a year and a financial penalty of $250,000.
It is also classified for Category A flood, which is punished with one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time he's been committing a criminal offense against Pauline.
In December 2017, he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Pelin.
His mother, Sarah Pilein, called the police to report the attack.
The case has now been brought before the Court of Justice of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, an obstacle to the criminal offence of domestic violence and possession of a weapon, while he was in a middle state.
His partner claimed to have stabbed her to the face.
Sarah Pilein was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 when she associated her son’s violent behavior with a transformational anxiety disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Seismic and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people lost their lives after a earthquake hit the island of Sulawezy in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake of the Richter scale caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks have been cut off, while the number of dead is expected to rise the following days.
The earthquake hit the central Sulauezy, located north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
In social media, video is broadcast from the time of the disaster.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a party on the beach in the city of Palo when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand the Spanishly imposed death penalty for the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York
Federal Prosecutors in New York are asking for the death penalty in Saifolo Saipoff, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that cost eight people - a rare punishment that has been imposed on the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipoff, 30 years old, is brought to use a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a West Side bus along the west coast bus in Lower Manhattan, by landing passengers and riders on his way on October 31st.
In order to justify the death sentence, the prosecutors should prove that Saipoff killed the eight victims "on purpose" and caused serious physical harm "on purpose", according to a statement of intent to impose the death penalty, which was lodged in the Court of Justice of the South Region of New York.
Both of these categories attack the death penalty, according to the document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal body of prosecutors brought Saipoff against the 22-point category, which included eight counts of murder against a criminal organization, a regular practice often applied by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime and a category of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and prosecuting" the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipoff carried out the attack as "atrophobic, hard and useless."
"Saifolo Hambullaevict Saipoff caused damage, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Clives, An-Lor Decand, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferutsi, Ernan Diego Mentosa and Alejandro Damian Panuko", as mentioned in the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been decades since the Court of Justice of the South New York Region held a case for the death penalty.
The accused, Halid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but he was finally sentenced to a fair trial in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was imposed for a federal case in New York was in 1953 in the spouses Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were sentenced after being sentenced to death for execution for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The two Rosenbergs were performed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipoff, a Uzbek resident, appeared to be impenetrable in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt satisfied with his operation, according to the police.
Saipoff told the authorities that he was inspired to complete the ISIS video attack that he saw on his cell phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to put the ISIS sign in his hospital room, according to the police.
He declared innocent of the 22 categories listed in the category.
David Patton, one of the federal public consultants representing Saipoff, said they were "evidently disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution authority.
"We believe that the decision to impose a death penalty rather than acceptance of the declaration of immunity for equal treatment with no possibility of detention will simply prolong the injury caused by the events for all those involved," Paton said.
Saipoff's defence team had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the execution of the death penalty.
Mr Toris said that the NAITZEL FARATZ should be the head of the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Faraz vowed to "mobilize the People's Army" today during a protest concentration at the Toris conference.
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians should "feel the pressure" of Eurospectors, as one of Teresa May's Members said that he should be the head of the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bowen told the protesters in Bermigham that the United Kingdom would "have already come out" so far if Mr Faraz was the responsible minister for Brexit.
But the challenge that Mrs May is facing in her attempt to reconcile the deep-seated Members of the European Union was underlined by the fact that the fugitives of the EU in Toris participated in a separate concentration of protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep the Chekers compromise plan under control through attacks by Brexit bombers, EU and EU attackers.
The allies continued to pursue its efforts to reach agreement with Brussels, despite the reactions and to force Eurospectives and Workers to choose between its package and the "hao".
Mr. Bowen said at the Left Means Leave (Design means Demission) protest meeting in Sollihal that he wanted to fly "the Checkers plan".
He said he should have given Mr Faraz a thank-you and given him powers to negotiate with Brussels.
"If we were chief, we'd have gone now," he said.
The Weilingboro MP added, "I will support Brexit, but we have to fly the Chekers project."
Expressing opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to become subjects.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr. Boone rejected the claims that the common opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The saying that the British people have changed their opinion and wants to stay is completely wrong."
Brexit's former MP Andrea Jenkins was also present at the demonstration and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chekers project does not have the acceptance of the general public, the opposition is not going to vote on it, does not have the acceptance of our party and our activists who go down the streets and below elect us.
Please let Checkers plan and start listening."
With a strong message to Mrs May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Faraz said in the concentration of protest that politicians should be required to "feel pressure" if they are prepared to deliver the decision taken by the 2016 referendum.
"There is now a question of trust between us - the people - and the order of our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let you get rid of it if you do."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make the order of our politicians, who are ready to betray Brexit, to feel pressure.
"We move the people of this country that has given us the victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we become an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the EU's airmen protested in Burma before they had a two-way concentration in the city centre.
A few activists called the Toris ban on Brexit after the group's concentration this weekend.
The Minister of Labour of Lord Adonis closed the Conservatives because of the security issues they dealt with with with an application of the party at the beginning of the meeting.
"It is the same people who tell us that they can put in place the information systems and all the technology necessary for the EU-type agreement – Canada with wealth, for the unintended borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete fiasco.
It doesn't mean good Brexit added.
Warren plans to take seriously the possibility of candidate for the Presidency
U.S. Secretary-General Elizabeth Warren said he would seriously consider candidates for the presidency after the November elections.
The Boston Globe newspaper reports that the author of the Republicans from Massachusetts spoke about her future plans during the concentration in the capital of Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who often criticises President Donald Trab, protests his re-election in November, against the Republican representative of Jeff Dill, who presided over the Trab campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is strongly claimed that it can be measured with the Trab in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon was its 36th meeting with voters making use of the buildings of the capital since the Tribbe began.
A speaker asked her if she was planning to apply for the presidency.
Warren said it's time to "go to Washington women to build our dissolved government, and that means a woman must be at the top."
arrest for the deadly shooting of LSU Sims
The police in Baton Rose of Los Angeles announced on Saturday the arrest of a suspect for the deadly shooting of LSU Wade Sims' cello.
Baton Rose's police department announced Deton Simpson's arrest, 20-year-old, in a type interview at 11mm (East Zone).
They had published a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying the man who appeared in the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot deadlyly near the University of Southern University site early on Friday.
"Weid Sims suffered a bullet wound in his head, leading to his death," police chief Merfi J. Paul said in the media on Saturday, according to the 247sports website.
Wade invested to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was discovered and admitted to being found at the point of possession of the gun and pledged to have shot Wade Sims.
Simson was arrested without resisting and detained in the Police Department of the Eastern Baton Roses Congregation.
Three-year-old Sims, who grew up in Baton Rose, played in 32 matches, with 10 appearances as a major player in the last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 ribands per race.
Grand Pri of Russia: Lewis Hamilton goes for a world title, as his team's instructions gave him the victory over Sebastian Fedel
It became clear from the time Valteri Botas passed in front of Louis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the game.
In the distance, Botas had a good start and almost hung Hamilton, as he defended his position in the first two turns and called Fedel to attack his stand.
Fedel went to the pit first and let Hamilton run into the race's tail, which should be decisive.
Mercedes went to the pit one round and went back to the Fedel, but Hamilton went out after a wheeled war, which forced Ferrari's driver to unintentionally abandon the internal risk of violating the dual movement to defend the third corner.
Max Fersteven started his last post and was seventh at the end of the first round of his 21st birthdays.
Then he left first for a large part of the race, holding his rails in order to end quickly and pass before Kimmy Reekon in fourth place.
He finally went to the pits at the 44th round, but he couldn't increase his speed to the remaining eight rounds, as Rickon came fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valteri was fantastic all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team went great and did the one-two," Hamilton said.
The language of the body was very bad
President Donald Trab closed the mayor Dane Fiinstein at a meeting on Saturday for insisting that he did not interrupt Christine Blaze Ford's letter, in which he accused the candidate for the High Court of Brit Kavano for sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the submission that Ford made before the Committee on Judicial Affairs of Georgia, commenting on the fact that those held in Georgia proved that people are "unscrupulous and ridiculous and false."
"The only thing that could happen is this beautiful thing that's happening in the last days in the Church, where you see anger, you see people who are angry and ugly and ridiculous and lying," he said.
"When you see ads and leaks and then they call you "oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Finnstein, did you blow up?
Remember her answer... you interrupted the document - "oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't break it."
Well, wait a minute.
If we broke... no, we didn't break," added the mayor.
Feinstein received Ford's letter containing details of the charges against Kawan in July and it occurred earlier in September - but Feinstein refused that the break was made by her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't break her story," Fiinstein told the committee, as mentioned in Hill's paper.
"He asked me to keep her secret and I kept her secret as he asked."
But her refusal did not appear to be particularly convincing to the president, who commented during the Saturday's concentration: "I'll tell you something, the language of the body was very bad.
He may not have done it, but it was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continued to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of three women for sexual harassment, the president suggested that the Democrats use the categories to serve their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power using any necessary means.
You see corruption, sport, they don't care who hurts, who has to walk to take power and control," the president said according to the Mediaite news website.
Elit Lig: Danny Starks 5-3 Belfast Jiands
Patrick Doier put two goals for the Jades against Dandy.
Danny Stars took his revenge for his fall in Friday's game at Elit Lig from Belfast Jiands, winning the 5-3 Ravan in Dandhi on Saturday.
The Jaids took an easy two-ball ride with Patrick Doier and Francis Boviere's suite.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cauni brought the plains to the plains before Doier returns the Jiands race.
François Busar gave Dandy a tip, and then two goals from Lucas Ludwald Nielsen secured the team's victory.
It was the third time in Elit Lig in the season for Adam Kiff's men, who were winning 2-1 on Dandy in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth season meeting between the two groups, with the Jades to win the last three matches.
Doier opened the score in the fourth minute at 3:35 with Kental McFol's assistant, while David Rutherford gave the scholarship to which Bobiger doubled the performance four minutes later.
In a period of time full of action, Sullivan put the field team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Markward gave the help for the esophagus from Cauni at 15:16.
Doier secured the twins' lead in the first half of the year when he achieved his second goal in the evening at the end of the first period.
The group of the peasants was rebuilt and Busar re-evaluated with a galloping force at 27:37.
Kany and Charles Corcoran joined their forces to help Nielsen give the lead in Dandy for the first time in the fight at the end of the second period, and he secured the victory with his team's fifth goal in the last period.
The Jades, who have lost in four of the last five games, are playing in their seats with Milton Kanes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller loses his life to free hundreds of aircraft from earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is declared a hero, losing his life in his attempt to secure the safe departure of a plane that carried hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed, and many were ignored because of a big earthquake that struck the island of Sulawezi on Friday, causing tsunamis.
Strong migrations continue to hit the region, and many have been trapped in riots in the city of Palou.
However, even though his colleagues were eager to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gounawaan Aung refused to leave his position at the checkpoint that he was moving on, at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palou.
He remained in his position to ensure that flight 6321 of the Batik Air, which was then on the take-off route, could safely land.
Then he jumped off the checkpoint when he thought it was broken.
He died later in the hospital.
The representative of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohanes Sirett, said that this decision could save hundreds of lives, as the ABC News TV network broadcasts.
We prepared a helicopter from Balicapán to California to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before he got to the Palo helicopter.
"We're obsessed with his death," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the dead may be thousands, while the country's disaster management service reports that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Bhutan is limited.
"The number of the dead is expected to increase, as many bodies are still under the grip, while many of them have not been able to reach them," said the service-type representative, Sutopo Pouruo Nugroho.
The waves that reached the six measures destroyed the Palus, which will complete a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Riya Kuzuuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute a patient brings bodies.
Clear water's a little bit.
The mini-markets are all over the place."
Jean-Gelfand, president of the International Red Star in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Star is struggling to save survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
What has happened is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's president, Joco Weidondo, arrived in Palo on Sunday and said to the country's army: "I ask you to work nightly to complete any work related to the decommissioning.
Are you ready?' handed over the CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lobeck, which cost more than 550 people their lives.
Ship crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after the crash of a ship on a lake
The airline flying at a Pacific coast in Micronesia now reports that a man is missing, while earlier it said that the 47 passengers and crew members had safely evacuated the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini in a type card said that since Saturday afternoon it is not in a position to find the marks of a man.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to identify the man.
The air carrier did not respond directly to requests for more information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Ships of the region helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane was hit in the water as he was trying to land at the island of Tsuk.
The authorities told Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were staying at the hospital on Saturday and that all of them were stable.
The causes of the conflict and the exact consistency of the events remain unclear.
The air carrier and the U.S. Navy said the plane was loaded at the port outside the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was over the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane landed very low.
"That's very good," said Janes.
Janes said that they and others managed to move through the water that reached them as the means to the emergency escape exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the airports had panicked and called, and he himself suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that some marines working nearby to improve a ship’s escape also helped by using a flashing boat to transport people to the coast before sinking the ship to about 30 metres (100 feet).
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have lost their lives in conflicts of air carriers registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these conflicts.
An analyst presents the schedule of the night when a woman became alive
The accused authority completed her procurement on Saturday at a man's repeated trial accused of burning a woman alive in 2014 from Mississippi.
The analyst of the U.S. Ministry of Justice Paul Roullet set up for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
She explained to the jury how she used cell phone files to line up the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Roulette said she received location files from various mobile phones that showed that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, renouncing his previous claims, as noted in the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers' cell the time it claimed it was with Michael Sanford's friend, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford posted as a witness on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the accused chief asked him if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said, "He was lying, because my truck was in Nasville."
One further objection was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Mobile files showed that they were only known for a week.
Roulette said that sometime after the death of Chambers, Tellis posted the messages, calls and contact details of Chambers on his phone.
"He wrote it out of his life," Heil said.
The defence is about to begin its purchase on Sunday.
The judge said he estimates that later that day the trial will be brought to trial by the jury.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip shot?
A hip-up three wants to question the negative view of the species, filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hipp has escaped from its roots, which were political messages and dealing with social issues.

Artists like Fugees and Commons are experiencing a recent recovery in the United Kingdom through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
And another black?
Danta in New York is texting a couple who fired her after receiving a "racist" message.
A New York Dating exercises treatment in a couple for racist dissolution after receiving a message that she miscarried her mother where the last one complained that the Dating was "another black man."
The couple refuse to be racist, like "exemption" treatment.
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, was disappointed when it was realized that the new Dita Giel Morris was black, just the last one showed up for her first day at work in 2016.
Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mr Morris twice.
As soon as she realized her gap, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman now released Mrs. Morris, saying that their missing dentist, who was from Africa, had not done any good work and was waiting for a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Mrs Morris received a salary for her one and only day of work and was then sent home with Uber.
Now, Mrs Moris has done treatment against the couple seeking compensation for the dismissal and has paid compensation for the 350-dollar class on the day for the six-month work as an internal detachment, for which it had initially been accepted, although without a contract.
"I want to show them that, look, you can't do such things," he told Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's a discriminatory treatment."
The couple objected to the claims that they were racist, saying that it was reasonable to fire Morris, as they feared that they could not trust her again after they attacked her.
"My husband sent her something she didn't want to send.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've offended, even mistakenly?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Comparing treatment with "exemption", Plasco said his wife had just been born two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Would you hunt someone who's in this situation?
It's not that kind" the bank investor added.
While the legal case is in progress, the Court of Common Opinion has insisted on condemning the couple in the social media, condemning them for their behaviour and rationale.
Pantington’s publishers were afraid that readers would not be interested in a boy speaking, as a new letter reveals.
Bod's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to get into the position of someone who read it for the first time before his release.
It's a lot of fun when you know what we know now about the great success of Pentagon."
She said her father, who worked as an iconic at the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book from a plastic bear, was optimistic about his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "glucopic", as her father left his life last year.
Regarding Pantington, which he describes as "a very important member of the family", he added that his father was secretly proud of his subsequent success.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn't a superhero," he said.
"But because Pantington was so real in his eyes, it was almost like having a kid who's doing something: you're proud of it even if it's not yours in fact.
I think that's how he looked at Pantington's success.
Although it was a creation of his own and of his imagination, he always gave the stamps to his own Pantington."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After the arrival, her daughter was transferred to the Hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"Nad was calling all the time and telling me it was very bad, that he had not many hopes of success," said Ednan-Laperuz.
"Sometime Nand called me to tell me he was gonna die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tasi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be near you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors gave her to keep her heart alive gradually decreased and came out of her organization.
She had already died a few hours before that time and now they're all sinking.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream, cry, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stay cold."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who has so far believed in the loss of her daughter, was on the plane with the other passengers, who were ignoring the test she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I had my head down and they were bleeding all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was in the plane, I got a feeling of compassion for Nand.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Women who pass the loss of their own people hang cards on the bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide are trying to prevent other people from taking their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamphreys hang on a bridge of Wales cards with funny messages and phone numbers that can be used to get support.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I feel every day," he said.
45-year-old Mr. Davis, who lives in Lindney, said her son was a very promising chef with a portable smile.
"They all knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile was lighting up the room."
However, he quit his job before he died, as he was in a very bad situation.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after ending his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm pretty worried there's gonna be an impact."
Mr. Davis created the cards "to inform the world that there are people out there to whom you can go and talk, even if they are your friends.
Don't stay silent - you need to talk."
Mrs Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davis for many years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old companion, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt trapped or upset or something," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we observed a change in his behavior.
He had caught a foot on the day of Christmas - when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eyes."
He said his death caused them a huge injury, but they had to overcome it: "He solves the family.
It's bothering us.
But we must all continue and fight."

Brett Kavano's future is uncertain, as the FBI is starting to investigate.
"I thought that if we could really achieve something like what he was asking for - a research of limited length and limited object - we might be able to bring a little unity," said Mr. Fleic on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be dissolved in the midst of broken partial expenditures.
Why did Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters not want to investigate the FBI?
Their unwillingness is entirely due to the time line.
The interim elections are only in five weeks, on 6 November and if the Republicans, as expected, do not do so well, they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to achieve the election of the person they want in the highest court of the country.
George Walker Bus calls to the Georgians, urging them to support Mr. Kavano, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Asley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI report is presented?
A vote will be taken in the Parliament, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Republicans.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavano can take at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pens, the vice-president, to take the majority and ensure his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean deputies falls under Kim's authority
The number of deputies from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Young Won came into power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, providing data from the Ministry of Integration of South Korea, said 1,127 distances were observed last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the strictest border controls between North Korea and China and the higher charges on mobile persons were key factors.
Pyongyang hasn't made any public comments.
In the overwhelming majority of the apostates from North Korea, the population of South Korea is finally offered.
Seoul reports that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them escape through China, which has the largest borders with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavy Restrainted Zone between North and South Korea.
China considers illegal immigrants to be refugees rather than refugees, and often exonerates them through violence.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are typically still in war, have improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier in the month, the leaders of the two countries met at Piunjang to discuss the negotiations on nuclear disarmament, which have been delayed.
This meeting came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trab and Kim Young Won in Singapore, where they agreed on their terms to cooperate in the nuclearisation of the Korean territory.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Rim Jong Il accused the US of missing progress ever since.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these conditions, in no case will we disarm our country alone first," said Mr. Reim in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelozy calls Brett Kavano "sister," he says it's inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
The Democratic President of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelozy called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavano "external" and said that he was personally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelozie made these comments at a Saturday conference at the Texas Tribune Festival in East Texas.
"I could only think that if a woman acted in this way, she would be called "asterical," Pelozy commented on the Kawan's submission to the Committee on Judicial Affairs of Georgia on Thursday.
Kavano, with a strong motivation, denied the charges that he had committed a sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when he was both teenagers.
During his successful purchase, Kawano was deeply moved, sometimes almost cried, and his voice was as we talked about his family and his school years.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the committee, characterizing the charges against him as a "terrestrial and coordinated political murder" organised by liberals who were angry with Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelozy said he believed that Kavano's claim had proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, since he had shown that he was pre-empted against the Democrats.
"I think that he has ruled himself out with these statements and with the way he has succeeded against Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelozy responded when asked whether he would try to complain against the Kavano if his appointment was confirmed and whether the Republicans obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this - if he does not tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, then he is not only fit for the Supreme Court, but also for the court at which he is currently serving," Pelozy said.
Kawano is a judge in the District Court of Appeals (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals).
Pelozie added that as a Democratic, he was concerned about the possible decisions of the Kavano regarding the Act on Affordable Care Act or the Roy v. Wade case, as a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm his appointment, Kawano failed to answer questions as to whether he would reject certain decisions of the High Court.
"Isn't it time to go to court an austere, predestined man and wait for us to say "isn't that great?" said Pelozie.
And women must have it in their possession.
It's a justified explosion, months and years of anger disappear and can't get it out of her without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later.
"I don't find it unusual, do you?"
She went on to say, "It helped me a lot, a woman who was an expert somewhere, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but had developed a technique according to which when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm upset because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And so he just kept going.
And I thought it was great."
The blood is allowed as a burst of anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my deepest memories of a job I had done in the past, in an office where men ruled, is once I cried out with sudden anger and caught me from the back a bigger woman -- a cold manager I was always afraid of -- and dragged me to a ladder.
"Don't ever let them see you cry" he told me.
"They don't know you're fired.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they broke it to you."
Patricia Srender, then Democratic Guardian of Colorado, had cooperated with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested for having drawn up an out-of-court relationship with a ship named Monkey Business (Bromodoulia) and left the struggle humiliated, Mrs. Srenter, deeply disappointed, thought that there was no reason not to consider the idea of putting the same candidate for the presidency.
"It wasn't such a wise decision," he said, laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone described the situation as "The Snow and the Seven Nails."
Because the campaign had already begun for a long time, it was back in funding and so it was sworn it would not be in the election race if it had not collected $2 million.
The fight was lost.
He discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave it only $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" he asked.
In her speech in which she announced that she would not start an official campaign, she was very strongly charged with feelings - gratitude for the people who supported her, disappointment with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than for representatives and anger with sexism - who felt a lump in the throat.
"You'd think I'd become a nervous clone," recalls Mrs. Schroeder about the type's reactions to her.
"You'd think Kleinex was my partner's donor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write on my graveyard?
"Scream?"
How the trade war between the US and China can do good in Beijing
The greetings of the commercial war between the US and China were revealing, and while the war still has much to finish, a gap between the two countries can benefit for the long-term Beijing, experts say.
American President Donald Trab released the first warning shot earlier this year, taxing basic Chinese exporting products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week, the largest scale developed with new tariffs of USD 200 million (150 million) in the form of half of all products imported into the USA from China.
Beijing returns fires to species every time, while recently it has charged a fee of between five and ten per cent in goods worth 60 million dollars.
China is determined to respond to American fires and the world's second largest economy is not likely to put it down soon.
In order to succeed in making Washington comply, he must submit to their demands, but public appeal in the United States would be too embarrassing for Si Jinping, China's president.
But, according to experts, if Beijing can play its cards correctly, American pressures in the context of the trade war could be positive for China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic collapse in any of the two countries is in fact much more dangerous than observers in the past have accepted," said Abigail Grace, a research associate with a study centre in Asia, at the Center for New American Security, a lecturer.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding the seven-year-old (and now) war of the country.
Speaking at the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Wailid al Mualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore regularity.
All the conditions are now fulfilled for the voluntary return of refugees to the country which was required to leave due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war broke out in 2011.
Another six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian help.
Al Mualem said the aid to rebuild the destroyed country is welcome by the Syrian government.
However, it pointed out that it would not accept aid under conditions or aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe locks victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018, winning the US team with a final score of 16.5 versus 10.5 in the Gulf of Le Golf National, outside Paris in France.
The American team has now been invited 6 consecutive times to European territory and has been winning the Riyadh Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again took the lead, as the Danish leader Thomas Bjorn's group reached the 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
The star of the U.S. Phil Michaelston team, which fought hard during the major tournament, threw its drop into the water at the par-3 16th hole, giving victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was missing in all its rounds, and so it became 1 of the 4 players that achieved 5-0-0 since the current form of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit was defeated at 5&4 by the lowest player in the European team, Dano Thorbjorn Olsen.
The best-ranking player in the world, Dustin Johnson, won 2 and 1 against Ian Powder from England, who can play his last game at Cupello Raider.
The Spanish Veteran Eight Kypell Rainer, Sergio Garcia, was the most winning European of all times in the tournament with total degrees 25.5.
"Of course I don't cry, but today I can't hold.
It was a difficult year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we got the doll back.
It's all for the team and I'm glad I was able to help," Garcia said excitedly after the European victory.
It gives the dog to John Ram's compatriot, who won the American legend of Golf Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual game on Sunday.
"I feel incredible horrors that I won Tiger Woods, I grew up admireing this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost his four matches in France, and now he has a career record at Küpello Rainder 13-21-3.
Unusual statistics for one of the biggest players of all times, who has won 14 important titles and only Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team had a hard time finding a goal all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who played a high-level golf course throughout the tournament.
American leader Jim Farick spoke after his group's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these kids, they fought it.
A few moments this morning we pressed enough for Europe.
We fought hard.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great leader.
And his 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, work with the US PGA and the Küpellou Reinder Committee and move forward.
I love these 12 kids and I'm proud to be their leader.
We have to admit it.
They were better than us."
Information on red palorroia: Concentrations are reduced in Pinelas, Manati and Sarasota provinces
The latest announcement by Florida's Committee on Fish and Wild Life shows a general decline in the Red Palirroa concentrations for parts of the Tamba region.
According to the FWC, conditions of illegal clans are observed in areas of Pinelas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Kolier, which suggest a reduction in concentrations.

Thousands are found about 10 miles open on the coast of the province of Hilsmboro, but in less points than last week.
Red Palirroia has also been observed in the province of Pasco.
Meteorological concentrations were recorded on the coast and on the shore of the Pinelas province last week, low to high concentrations were recorded on the coast in the province of Hilsmboro, underground to high concentrations in the province of Manati, sea concentrations to high or open sea concentrations on the coast in the province of Sarasota, sea concentrations to moderate concentrations in the province of Charlotte, sea concentrations to high concentrations on the coast or above the coast in the province of Sarasota.
Breathing in the respiratory system continues to be recorded in the provinces of Pinelas, Manati, Sarasota, Li and Kolier.
There have been no disturbances in the respiratory system in Northwestern Florida last week.
