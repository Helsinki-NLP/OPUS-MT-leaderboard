Members of the Assembly of the country of Wales concerned about "walking for puppets"
Galois elections are supported by a proposal to replace their title by the MWP seal (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Galois Parliament).
This proposal stems from the draft amendment of the name of the Assembly, which would become the Galois Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be the subject of rails.
A labourer's election indicated that his group is concerned that the label "Rhyme with Twp and Pwp".
For non-originating readers in Wales: in gallois, twp means stupid, and pwp means crotte.
According to one of its members, Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other formulas.
The conservative party would be "open" to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (marionnet), the distance is narrow.
In this context, in gallois, your letter is pronounced as the letter or in English of the Yorkshire region.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently preparing legislation introducing the change of name, said that "the final decision on the appointment of members of the Assembly refers to the latter".
The Law 2007 on the Government of Wales of Wales (2017) gives the galloise Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Galois Parliament, which has been widely supported.
On the issue of membership, the Commission is thinking about Members of the Galois Parliament (or WMP), but a large majority of Gallois prefers MWP.
It seems that the members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach consensus could be a real case for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who should submit a draft law on change of name in the coming weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the question of the name during the discussions on the draft law.
Macedonia: referendum on the amendment of the country's name
Macedonians will decide Sunday if their country should now bear the name "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a happy old couple of decades between the country and its Greek neighbour, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens stressed the fact that Macedonia's name is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on the accession of its neighbouring country to the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, opposed the referendum, indicated that he would not take the results into account.
However, participants such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the change of name is only a small price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in difficulty, St. Martin's bells reduced to silence
"The elderly people I discussed with say that traditionally there was a bar and a church at every corner of the street," says Mr. Adams.
"There is no more than there is today."
According to him, it's normal for bars to be refurbished.
Today, "we don't get to do the same thing anymore, he explains.
"Before, we went to the bar like his neighbor, but that's not the case anymore."
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will be exhausted before the owners imagine themselves, and this concerns him: "before or after, they will return to the home."
He added that the churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who would not help entertain the last sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
"People who buy condominiums in these buildings will be most of the Whites who will precipitate the closing of all churches, because they are unlikely to become members of them," he is concerned.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The initial White Methodist Congregation left places in the 1930s.
A black congregation, which preached in the area, took possession of the building.
The church of Saint Martin was resumed by a black community under the direction of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the 125th Street stores, one of the main commercial streets in Harlem, where the Blacks were suffering from being employed or being promoted.
In 1939, a fire destroyed the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were ready to rebuild and command a new carillon,
that the son and successor of Father Johnson to the direction of the church of Saint Martin, the Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the "poverty bells".
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave him another name: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
She also mentions that this is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took a seat in front of the largest carillon of the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather claims that Saint Martin did not replace him.
Over the past few months, there have been many questions about the removal of architects and entrepreneurs, caused by the secular elite of the church on the one hand, and the Episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body made up of secular officials, informed the diocese that he was concerned that the latter wanted to impose the costs on him, although he did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some Parisians have regretted the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: A 13-year-old girl injured by a shark in a lobster fishing party
According to the authorities, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old girl last Saturday while practicing lobster fishing in California on the day of the opening of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 o'clock in the morning near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported on KSWB-TV, the San Diego TV channel, that he had been swimming with friends since a half-hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and went to pay up to him to get him out of the water.
In the first time, Chad thought that the young boy was shouting with joy of having a take, and then he realized that in reality he
was bitten.
As he got close to the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the clavicle.
"I was listening to everyone get out of the water: There's a shark!" explains Chad.
The boy was evacuated to the Children's Council of San Diego hospital, where he is still in a critical state.
The species of shark at the origin of the attack is not known.
At a press conference, the rescue chief Larry Giles reported that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of the torso.
The authorities closed access to the Ponto Beach beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours, to conduct an investigation as well as for security reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but most are considered non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's offensive plans in the British aesthetic market
Sainsbury's hands down on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and the beams similar to those of the supermarket, lots of aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by domain specialists.
As a result of a major increase in the UK aesthetics market of 2.8 billion sterling books, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and home items are falling, more extensive beauty products will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience becomes conclusive.
The supermarkets today invest in the beauty market in order to re-use the space previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's indicated that it would increase the volume of its bids to 3,000 cosmetic articles, which will understand for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in similar sectors to shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also renews its Boutique makeup line to offer a majority of products not tested on animals, which is increasingly important among young consumers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume seller will try concessions in two Sansbury's shops, the first opened last week in Croydon, in southern London, and a second of which is scheduled for opening in the current year in Selly Oak (Birmingham).
Supermarket leaders need to raise their heads to attract consumers, who are increasingly trying to make their purchases online and to go to nearby shops for daily food.
Mike Coupe, Director General of Sainsbury's, said the sales points would increasingly look like the big surfaces, because the supermarket chain tries to counter Aldi and Lidl discount shops by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos sales points in hundreds of shops and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores since the purchase of the two chains 2 years ago, which, according to the group, has enabled the sale of common consumer goods and the profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempts to restructure the pharmaceutical and cosmetic articles of the British chain were met with failure.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but it ended with a debate on the distribution of the benefits of the drugs in the supermarkets.
It was after 3 years ago that he sold his 281 pharmacies for an amount of 125 million sterling books in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, which the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds had to play a role in introducing a wide range of high-quality skin care brands in 4 shops, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty product rays was modified to improve the customer framework.
"We have also invested in training so that our staff can offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to respond to any kind of need and, thanks to the attractiveness of our radios and the ideal situation of our institutions, our domination of the cosmetic market is now undisputed and changes the purchasing habits," he added.
Anger of Peter Jones after the withdrawal of Holly Willoughby from an agreement of 11 million £
The stars of the Dragon's Den TV program, Peter Jones, after the announcement of the withdrawal of the Holly Willoughby an 11 million-£ contract related to its home decoration brand, to dedicate itself to its new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to deal with the brand of interior decoration and True accessories.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
At the age of 37, this Morning animator announced on Instagram that she would withdraw.
Holly Willoughby has made Peter Jones, the Dragon's Den star, angry, withdrawing from their fruitful textile activity and interior decoration in the last minute, to devote himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources have said that Jones was angry when the cute child of the TV revealed, at a meeting that took place under stress at the seat of the Dragon's Den Star in Marlow (Buckinghamshire), that his new contracts, up to 1.5 million sterling books, no longer allowed him to take care of Truly, their brand of decoration and interior accessories.
The True brand was assimilated to that of actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the animator's fortune estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, announced on Instagram that she was leaving True, Jones jumped into his private jet to join one of his secondary residences outside Britain.
According to one source, "Truly was far away one of Holly's priorities
and in the process of securing its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone without a voice.
No one could imagine what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow's seat is filled with products ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning animator, which is one of Britain's most "bankable" celebrities, could cause millions to lose the company, due to major investments in products ranging from pillows or bungalows, to interior clothing or articles, and the risk of delayed launch.
Furthermore, it could end a long friendship.
Willoughby and his husband Dan Baldwin, parents of 3 children, have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created True with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52 years old, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
Couples shared together on holiday and Peter Jones holds 40% of the shares in the Baldwin TV production company.
Willoughby should become the brand ambassador for M&S and will take the place of Ant McPartlin as an animator of I'm A Celebrity of ITV.
A source near Jones said last night that he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was tedious, but we finally adored each other.
Trump laughed at the media who criticised him because of his comment that some judge "indignity of a president" and to prove so positive to the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump give so much? "
He's laughing, taking a voice from a TV journalist.
"I didn't give up at all."
He noted that Kim Jong-one had been in favour of a second meeting, after Trump qualified the first one, which took place in Singapore in June, not long after the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on this denuclearization are at a dead end.
More than 3 months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomacy leader Ri Yong Ho told world leaders, at the United Nations General Assembly, on Saturday, to see no "response" of the United States to the first disarmament measures of North Korea.
On the contrary, he regrets that the United States continues to impose sanctions to maintain the pressure.
In his talk on Trump's assembly, he offers a much more optimistic perspective.
"It's all right with North Korea," said the North American President.
We have broken the armed conflict.
"Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have a great relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim led to positive results: the end of missile shooting tests, the release of hostages, and the remains of American soldiers to their families.
He also justified his little habitual approach to the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this full arena to crack, there's hardly 200 standing in front of me," he criticised.
Tsunami: a devastated island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that ravaged Lombok, foreign NGOs' assistance was not necessarily necessary.
More than 10 per cent of the population in Lombok have been separated, but no national disaster has been decreed, a condition required for the launch of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have often made it clear that they did not want international help, which complicates things a little," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While the Save the Children organization has set up a team to go to Palu, she still does not know if the field work will be allowed.
The spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, Mr. Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities assessed the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite the constant droughts, the country lacks the means to cover its natural habitats.
There were shelters in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning has been given, no alarm siren has been sent to Palu, which has undoubtedly contributed to human losses.
Even under ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not a simple thing.
Natural disasters make the use of transport more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been placed in Lombok to care for the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the places of the new disaster.
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, placed the infrastructure reform at the centre of his electoral campaign and spent considerable sums to report on the railways and roads.
The lack of funds, however, led Mr. Joko's government, called on to represent itself before the voters next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure from the persistence of interethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority exercise their faith more conservatively.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been chased from their homes, on the basis of confrontations in the streets between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool attacker Daniel Sturridge achieves equalization against Chelsea

Sturridge received a passage from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 metres away from Chelsea's goals, and his team was headed from 1 to 0.
He shot in the ball on his left, before leaving a shot to the second pole.
The ball flew over the repair surface before heading to the top right corner of the row.
The ball finished by reaching Kepa Arrizabalaga and finished its course at the bottom of the cage.
"I was just trying to sit down, get me out of the ball, but players like Shaq always get away as far as possible, so I tried to make the most of my time," Sturridge confides in LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching to control and without really much thought I decided to shoot."
Chelsea drove 1 to 0 at mid-time after a target of the Belgian star Eden Hazard at 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker scored a passage towards Mateo Kovacic, before heading towards the middle of the field and sprinting on Liverpool side.
Kovacic performs a rapid go-and-come in the middle of the field,
Then he made a magnificent deep shot that kind of Hazard in the surface.
Hazard crossed the defense and ended his race in the second pole, with a left foot arrow behind the Liverpool Portier, Alison Becker.
Liverpool will meet the Napolitians in the group phase of the League of Champions, Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo de Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA Europe League at 3 p.m. this Thursday in London.
Indonesia: The number of Tsunami victims rose to 832
The disaster management agency indicated on Sunday morning that the earthquake and tsunami account for 832 deaths.
Many inhabitants are trapped under the ruins of the buildings destroyed by the earthquake of a magnitude of 7.5 that swept the country on Friday and triggered waves of 6 meters high, informed Sutopo Purwo Nugroho's spokesman at a press conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was surrounded by ruins of ruined buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of arresting a woman
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's body was found at Birkenhead (Merseyside) this morning.
At 07h55, the 44-year-old woman was discovered on John de Grayson Mews Street, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
The police urge the residents of the neighborhood who would have seen or heard something to give their testimony.
The police captain, Brian O'Hagan, made the following statements: "The investigation is just about to begin, but I would like to ask anyone who was around John Street at Birkenhead who would have seen or heard any of the suspects contact us.
In particular, I call upon taxi drivers, who could have caught something on their dascam and asked them to provide us with any critical information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found in a Birkenhead property in which she lived.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman came to the scene of the crime and asked questions about where she was discovered.
The investigation is under way and the police have indicated that she was informing the relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver just refused access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, the police not letting anyone in or out of the building.
The news left him without a voice.
Residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
One police officer said that the whole sector was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared on the scene,
repeating: "It's too horrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were stationed inside the cordon, and another outside.
Several officers were monitoring the building on the inner side of the cordon.
Anyone who has information is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact the crime failure organization at 0800 555 111, indicating the register 247 of 30 September.
Parliament: Cromwell's statue, the last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its ban would be the just return of things, given the acts of destruction, of countless religious and cultural property of England, committed by its Puritan partisans, such as the fanatic Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society considers Mr. Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and called it "revisionist attempt".
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said that, "in view of the current debate about the withdrawal of statues, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell's one raised before the Palace of Westminster was not to be spared.
Cromwell did not order or lead the iconoclasm in English civil wars.
It is likely that his person was sacrificed for the actions of his father Thomas during the previous century.
The wonderful representation of Cromwell, carved by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the consideration that was given to him in the 19th century and belongs to the historiography of a personality that many of us still celebrate."
Mr. Goldsmith said the following to Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more by the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, I mean of course the monarchy.
The fact that this representation is precise or not is a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that erupted in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure that represents a side of the fracture.
Its fulfillments as Lord Protector also deserve to be highlighted and commemorated."
China : a cock kills an elevator
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a cochon in a South-East China market.
Identifyed as Mr. Yuan, the man was found dead, the blood-stained and covered arterial near a market pig in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig breeder prepares to inject pigs vaccines into a pig pig breed, on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He would have traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the neighborhood was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and that blood flowed from his throat.
A legal medical report confirms that the animal weighing 250 kg has mutated the lift to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr Wu, the cousin of the lift, said that "his legs were broken and covered with blood."
The security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving on the market at 0440 on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig at the origin of Mr. Yuan's death did not belong to the lift or to his cousin.
A market manager has entrusted Evening News that the animal was locked up to avoid any other incident and to allow the police to collect evidence.
Mr. Yuan's family and the leaders of the market would be negotiating a compensation.
Although the facts are rare, pig attacks against individuals have already been reported.
In 2016 in a Massachusetts farm, a pig assaulted a woman and her husband, seriously hurting the latter.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 295 kg took a gallium lift on its tractor before his wife managed to remove it.
In 2012, while a Oregon climber had just been eaten by his cocoons, a Manitoba farmer claims to CBC News that it is not in principle an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood can cause this type of behavior.
"They are animals rather than players,
Very curious guys... they have no intention of doing anything wrong.
It is enough to show them the respect they deserve," he assures.
The remains of the Rosa hurricane should cause severe precipitation in the south-east of the United States
According to the forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakened as it moves above the coldest waters on the northeast coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will lead to deviations in North-East Mexico and the South-West of the United States during the coming days.
The wind blew at 135 km/h (category hurricane 1) since 5 o'clock in the morning, on the east of Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
The hurricane should move north on Sunday.
During this time, depression begins to form above the Pacific Ocean and circle to the east, toward the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Lower California Peninsula in the form of a storm, hurricane Rosa will cause intense tropical humidity to the North, in the south-west of the United States.
It will fall up to 25 cm of rain in regions of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create widespread torrential rains in the South-West in the coming days.
At the local level, precipitations reaching between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause sudden harsh storms, spills of debris and potential landslides in the desert.
The deviations will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour per place, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It should fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in regions of the south-west, including a large part of Arizona.
Disseminated tropical rains may cause sudden flooding and rapid deterioration of the conditions.
It is strongly advised to venture into the desert on foot because of the threat of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into extinct rivers and storms will produce windmills and dust turbines by location.
The approaching depression will result in abundant local rains in some southern regions of the country, on the California coast.
The rainy totals can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could result in low flow of debris and make the shoe shiny.
This could be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
Dispersed tropical storms will reach Arizona on Sundays at the end of the day and early Monday mornings, and then they will intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Strong precipitation will take place at the four corners of the country on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
Significant changes in temperature are expected for the month of October through the United States due to the refurbishment of the Arctic, but the tropical climate will remain warm,
which sometimes causes a radical change of time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will be subject to considerable temperature differences on Sunday, is a perfect example.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between Saint Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, the difference is almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days, a persistent summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
A major part of the centre and east of the United States should be known as the beginning of a hot month of October, with temperatures around 26 degrees covering the plains of the south and other regions of the north-east.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average season.
Forecasts over several days indicate that temperatures should be higher than the average in the east of the United States during the first 15th of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Committed on 6 television channels Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh's seductive hearings, candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting him in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
While the lost political impasse, the broadcasting services interrupted their usual program on Friday to announce a playoff: an agreement by Jeff Flake, the Senator of Arizona, to allow the FBI to carry out an investigation into the charges for a week.
Before the Senate Judicial Commission, Christine Ford assured 100% that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had surrendered to attacks on her person and had tried to remove her clothes during a night between high school students.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate retreat, also claimed to be certain to 100% that it had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial probably reached an audience of more than 20.4 million.
The company calculated the number of TV viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures of other channels spreading the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is still not able to estimate the number of people watching television at the office.
As a comparison, the trial has attracted as many people as a football match or Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose animators have widely supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the most watched channel on the day of the hearings, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC held second place with an audience of 3.26 million.
CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), still following Nielsen.
The interest has not diminished once the hearing has been completed.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was playing on Friday.
After the Office of the moderate Republican issued a communiqué that he would vote for Kavanaugh, the CNN and CBS cameras revealed a scene in which the senator was taken part by demonstrators while trying to take the elevator to the hearing of the judicial commission.
Flake lowered his eyes for several minutes, while CNN retransmitted the sequence of live interpolation.
"Don't look elsewhere, look at me," launches one of the women.
"Do you really think he's telling the truth?
You hold power while so many women are disabled. ”
Before the elevator's doors were referred to, Flake indicated that his office had issued a statement and that it would be more relevant at the Committee meeting.
All cabled and broadcast network chains would cover the meeting in direct session a few hours later, while the Judicial Committee was preparing to vote on the procedure to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh throughout the Senate.
Flake indicated, however, that a one-week investigation should first be conducted by the FBI on charges brought against the candidate, which the minority democrats claimed.
Flake left in part convinced by discussing with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after having interviewed Coons and several other senators afterwards.
His choice weighed heavily on the balance, as the Republicans would not have actually obtained the votes to approve the appointment of Kavanaugh without a prior investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assault charges.
Britain: May accuses opponents in Brexit of making "small policy"
In an interview given to Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the detractors of her project of leaving the European Union, of making the "small policy" to the detriment of the future of Britain and national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another trade with the newspaper, which published a photo of Theresa May in cover, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued his attacks on his Chequers plans, claiming that the proposal for free trade between Britain and the European Union was "religious".
Wayde Sims: The police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being at the origin of the LSU player's death
Police arrested a fatal gun suspect who led to the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20 years old, was beaten and charged with murder to the second degree, reported Baton Rouge police service.
The authorities published a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and the police indicated that Sims had lost his glasses during the altercation.
Found at the crime scene, Simpson's DNA was found to be a subsidiary of the CBS group, according to WAFB.
During his interrogation, Simpson admitted to the police to be responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The legal doctor's office of the Baton-Rouge parish published a preliminary report on Friday, which determines that death was caused by a wound by a bullet that crossed the head and landed in the neck.
The police service recognizes the assistance received by the Fugitive Task Force of Louisiana State, the medical-legal laboratory of the state police, the South University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sport director of the LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the forces of the order for their "commitment and search for justice".
He was only 20 years old.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton-Red, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
On average, it scored 5.6 points and performed 2.6 rounds per match during the last season.
Friday morning, Will Wade, LSU basketball coach said the team was "damaged and shocked" after the news of Wade's death.
"We're always cutting back on this kind of event," Wade said.
Mexico: a cracker volcano of the ashes
From the ashes away from the Volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre recommended to Mexicans to leave the volcano after recording a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 gas and ashes emissions within 24 hours.
The centre monitored several earthquakes and earthquakes from Popocatepetl.
On social networks, images showed fine ash layers covering the car bristles in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the level of the volcano 72 km from the capital, since an earthquake of a magnitude of 7.1 swept the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, named Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalogue: Coping with separatists at the approach of the voter's independence anniversary
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona following clashes between independent protesters and the anti-democratic police, while thousands of opponents joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided the Catalonia.
Before being reclaimed by anti-emetic policemen, masked separatists threw eggs and colored powder, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not meet tourists.
Firefighters also exploded later in the day, while the police used mattresses to contain the clashes.
For several hours, groups in favour of independence that were "forgetting neither forgiveness nor forgetting" have faced unionist parties that create "long life in Spain".
14 demonstrators who had minor injuries were treated according to local press.
One year after the 1st October referendum, considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by the Catalans in favour of separation, tensions remain in the independent region.
A overwhelming majority of voters have chosen independence, despite a low rate of participation, the opposition to the secession having largely boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing poll offices in the region.
Independent groups had camped on Friday night to block a demonstration of support for the national police.
This was the same place, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said that he no longer had any hope of independence from Catalonia.
"We were witnesses last year of a great time.
My parents would be happy to be able to vote, but now we are in an impasse," he laments.
Despite their capital victory, although small, regional elections last December, the independent Catalan parties have had the difficulty of maintaining the elite this year, with many popular leaders being exiled or detained pending trial for organizing the referendum and declaring the independence of Catalonia.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who is filming police support on her phone, believes that politicians are responsible for blocking the situation, on the one hand, and on the other.
"Tension only makes you up," he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the 9 Catalan leaders in prison awaiting a trial since last year, announced his intention to present his candidacy to the elections of the European Parliament next year.
"It is for me the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression of the Spanish government," he added.
Arrest in Londonderry : Men hit a house in a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after several times on a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 a.m. local time.
Police Captain Bob Blemmings said the doors and walls were damaged.
The car would also have received arrow shots.
Livingstone wins the game 1 to 0 against the Rangers thanks to Menga
The first goal of Dolly Menga ensures the victory of Livingstone
Recently, the Livingstone team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second victory in 18 matches in Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the Ibrox club.
Menga's goal made the whole difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to place themselves in 2nd position of the ranking, equal to Hibernate.
Gerrard's men are deprived of victory outside of Premiership's league this season, and must confront the Hearts team Sunday, which runs 8 points.
But first, the Rangers will meet the Rapid of Vienna on the occasion of the European League this Thursday.
With regard to the Livingstone team, it extends 6 matches its invaginated course in the division, and its main coach Holt, who has been replacing Kenny Miller since last month, may be concerned that he has not lost the least meeting yet.
Livingston missed an opportunity to face emotional opponents
Holt's team could have made progress well before marking, as their direct approach made Rangers difficult.
Scott Robinson tried to hunt down but remained locked in front of the opposite goal; followed a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a head pass by Craig Halkett.
The Livingstone team let the Rangers own the balloon, knowing that it could generate them thanks to the tactics they worked.
That's where the ultimate goal is.
The Rangers gave a free shot and Livingston tried to open up; Declan Gallagher and Robinson allied themselves to confection Menga, who took a touch and entered a goal from the ground.
At this stage, Rangers dominated the game but faced an impenetrable defense and the target guard Liam Kelly was only rarely worried.
The second half knows the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop to Kelly.
The Rangers' Guardian Allan McGregor stopped by foot a hit by Scott Pittman, while Lithgow managed to play one of Livingstone's plans.
The Guardian of Livingstone rejected all attempts and protected his cage, while two sentences were denied by the arbitrator, one for the provocation of Halkett directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a mistake of hand.
Livingston’s “Penomene ”
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and wife-to-be performance for Livingstone.
They have all been excellent and continue to surpass expectations on this upward slope.
Their style and composition of the team have not changed since they returned to the summit, but merit has largely returned to Holt to have a team motivated since their arrival
who has many big players.
The defense of Captain Halkett was great and wonderfully organized, and Menga was able to hold Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in the hall throughout the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite having a good level with Gerrard, they have not been at the height of their past talent.
They missed a last chance and managed to get the opposite side only once; this is a warning for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Mitigated home of President Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, the Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to improve relations between NATO allies.
Various issues have been addressed, such as human rights, freedom of the press or Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Invoking security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 protesters from meeting in front of the building, while many participants were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurdish, voiced their voices, condemning both the policies of Erdogan and the German government's decision to welcome him to his country.
The clevage that emerges from protests reflects this double vision of Erdogan: a visitor welcomed by some Germans of Turkish origin and qualified as autocratic by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies following a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred around 10:00 local time, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a frequent route from Deptford to the south-east of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, the rescues arrived on the spot, but the man died at the site of the accident.
This accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday.
The London police said that the officers were implementing everything to identify the individual and prevent his or her loved ones.
Roads have been closed and bus deviations have been set in place. Car drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Prison Long Lartin: 6 agents injured during a riot
The prison officer for high-security men said that six prison officers had been injured during a riot.
The escape began in the HMP Long Lartin prison, located in Worcestershire, about 09:30 a.m. local time this Sunday. It is still not under control.
Specialized anti-semitic agents were sent to unlock the situation, involving 8 prisoners and contained in a prison wing.
On the spot, the officers were treated for minor facial injuries.
A spokesperson for the prison management said: "The specially trained personnel were deployed to restore the order in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six agents were taken care of for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will have to respond to the police authorities and be able to see their sentences prolonged."
More than 500 prisoners, including those considered to be the most dangerous in the country, are imprisoned in the HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the prison manager was hospitalized as a result of an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, anti-semitic agents were sent to prison to cause a serious disturbance: prisoners attacked the staff with billiard bullets.
Ouragan Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by sudden cruelness (which could be beneficial for areas affected by drought)
It is rare that tropical depression affects Arizona, but this is undoubtedly what will happen at the beginning of next week. The hurricane Rosa is heading toward the desert of the south-west with what remains of energy. This region could be affected by sudden harshness.
The National Weather Service has already issued a flood warning for Monday and Tuesday for the west of Arizona, south and east of Nevada, south-east of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, with a lot of rains on Monday night.
The national weather service based in Phoenix stated in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have preserved the stage of depression or tropical storm in a 300 km perimeter around Phoenix since 1950!
The hurricane Katrina (1967) was stopped 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest estimates of the National Hurricane Center include 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm per place in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other regions of the south-west desert including the central area of the Rocheuses and the Grand Bassin should record between 2.5 and 5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measures of up to 10 cm.
The rains of Rosa could be life-saving for regions affected by drought that are not exposed to the risks of sudden cruelty.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, the rain could be beneficial for the south-west region, given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring system, a little more than 40% of Arizona experienced at least one extreme drought, the second most serious category," reports weather.com.
Ouragan Rosa begins her way on the coasts, in the peninsula of Lower California.
With a great power Sunday morning and generating wind that can reach 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moved north at 20 km/h.
The storm encounters the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It should reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday night.
In some regions of Mexico, precipitation may be massive and may pose a risk of flooding.
"In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitations are expected from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm," said weather.com.
Rosa will then cross the Mexico towards the north, with the strength of a tropical storm, and reach the border of Arizona Tuesday, early in the morning, as a tropical depression. She will cross Arizona and south Utah in the evening.
"Torrent rains are expected in Lower California, north-west of Sonora and in the south-west desert and are the main threat," explains the National Hurricane Center.
It is estimated that these precipitations will result in potentially deadly steeps and debris leaks in the arid areas, as well as land glidings in the mountainous areas.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder, after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in the Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at 4 a.m. local time.
He was sent to the hospital, and his condition is now stable.
The Avon and Sommerset police reported that they had arrested the four young people (age 17, 18 and 20) on the night of Radstock.
Agents called on people who could have filmed the scene with their phone.
Trump states that Kavanaugh has been the victim of the wickedness and the wrath of the Democrats
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the impeccable and scandalous methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had been the victim of the wickedness and the wrath of the Democrats throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh expressed himself on Thursday in front of Congress, renouncing with energy and emotion Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that she was sexually assaulted several decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified during the hearing.
The president said Saturday that "the American people were witness to Kavanaugh's intelligence and courage" this day.
"A vote in the sense of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the sense of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in the public service," he explained to the crowd of participants gathered in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he referred to the importance of Republicans' participation in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm more involved than ever," he said.
"That's why I fight on all fronts for formidable candidates."
Trump said that the Democrats were in the mission of "resistance and obstruction".
The first decision-making vote in the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place by Friday, following the declaration of a collaborator of the Republican Party to CNN.
Indonesia: a seismic and tsunamis cause hundreds of victims, the balance sheet continues to rise
On Saturday, the authorities stated that at least 384 people had died, most of whom were taken by huge waves that hit the beaches while an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, struck the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu, when six-metre waves submerged the beach at the fall of the night. They took many lives and destroyed everything on their journey.
The earthquake, of a magnitude of 7.5, preceded the tsunami.
"When the Tsunami threat arose yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People did not run away immediately, it cost them their lives," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), said at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't happen alone. It brought cars, wooden pieces, rooms, everything carried with it," Nugroho explained, stating that the tsunami had moved in the sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people were able to save their lives by climbing the trees, he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The air images published by the disaster management agency show destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and scratched bridges, as well as a water mosque.
The replicas continued to drain the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Implementation (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the Friday earthquake was 200 times higher than the power of the atomic bomb released on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which is bordering a long narrow bay, could have expanded the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
Bodies were found lying under the ruins of ruined buildings, he added, stating that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said that human and material losses could be more important than 300 km north of Palu, a region called Dongala, the closest to the quake epicenter.
The communications were "completely paralysed" since Dongala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," said La Croix Red in a communiqué, adding that his staff and volunteers were heading to affected areas.
"The situation is dramatic and could get worse," she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not disclosing the information that a tsunami had touched Palu, although agents reported that waves had arrived when the alert was issued.
A shared amateur video on social networks shows a man on the floor of a building that creates a frenzy for passersby in the street that a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a water wall lay on the coast, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not authenticate to images immediately.
Earthquake and tsunami caused a general electricity shortage that cut all communications in Palu. It was therefore difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army began to seek help by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated people still need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport has stolen from rescue operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit Palu's evacuation centres on Sunday.
Indonesia: the Tsunami victim's balance sheet is reached with more than 800 deaths.
It's a tragedy.
The members of World Vision staff from Dongala arrived healthy and except for Palu, where they found refuge in shelters established in the court of their offices. On the way, they discovered devastating scenes, explains Mr. Doseba.
"They told me that they had seen many destroyed houses," he explains.
It's a tragedy.
When relief groups began to bring relief to the afflicted, some complained that very experienced foreign humanitarian workers had not had the right to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and foreign personnel can only enter the territory if the site affected is declared a national disaster area.
And that's not the case yet.
"This disaster is always considered regional," explains Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for La Croix Red Indonesia.
"As soon as the government declares that it is a national disaster, international assistance can take place, but we are still waiting."
When the second night after the earthquake and the Friday tsunami fell on Palu, the relatives of the missing people were still waiting for a miracle.
Saturday, a little boy was found in the sheds.
On Sunday, the saviors released a pregnant woman under the veil for two days, near her mother's body.
The coach of the national Indonesian paragliding team, Gendon Subandano, had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other of his students found themselves trapped in Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandadi added.
"As an old man in parapet discipline, I have lived my own dramas," he explains.
In the hours that followed the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the paragliding community, Mr. Gendon told us that he had sent whatsApp messages to athletes in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
His messages were left unanswered.
"I think they've never received my messages."
In Newport on the Levee, thieves subtilize $26,750 when reloading an automatic distributor
On Friday morning, the thieves had stolen $26,750 from a Brink's agent who was recharged by an automatic distributor in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Service press release.
The driver of the vehicle lived a distributor in the entertainment complex and was preparing to feed it, said Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the communiqué.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the distributor.
Many suspects would have seen witnesses leave, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person with information on their identity is requested to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name and becomes Ye
The Rapper Kanye West is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "Ancientity known as Kanye West."
At the age of 41, West, who has been known as Ye for some time, used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, came out in June.
The rapper made this change just before he went to the Saturday Night Live show, where he should present his new album, Yandhi.
His participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who cancelled his coming for "emotional reasons," explained the emission creator.
In addition to the abbreviation of his current professional pseudo, this nickname also has a religious significance for the West.
"I think "Ye" is the most used word in the Bible, where it means "you," explained West earlier this year, mentioning the title of his album with his Big Boy host.
"So I am you, I am us.
I have passed from Kanye, which means “only, ” to Ye - reflects good, evil, confusion, at all.
This album is a reflection of who we are."
West is not the only known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs was named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, has also played on the union and the capitals.
In Mexico, AMLO states that he will never resort to military force against civilians.
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use the military force against civilians, almost fifty years after bloodthirsty rebates of the forces of the order against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the place of Tlatelolco to "never use the military force to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops opened fire at a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people when the student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has committed himself to supporting Mexican youth by granting monthly grants to students and by opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding in this sector, according to the investor and expert in artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements occur after several U.S. government actors have made announcements about IA, while an official IA strategy fails in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its road map last year: it plans to become the IA innovation leader by 2030.
"Dublin research funds in the field of IA would be a good start, because all other countries have a long way ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next great discovery in IA," Lee explains.
Double funds could double the chances that the next key step in the field of IA comes from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's most important IA companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that beat the U.S. player Othello best-ranked. He then integrated Microsoft Reasearch management team and became president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee has already participated in technological competitions organized by the American government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Research Agency, and asked when the next competition would take place to identify visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to obtain government funding.
"It's not China that suits university leaders, it's companies," Lee says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited large university names to work on IA.
Lee added that the changes in immigration policies could also support US IA efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically given to IA researchers," he says.
The State Affairs Council of China launched its artificial intelligence development plan for a new generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China grants funding to members of academic institutions, as well as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which must involve industry and academic partners. The House-Blanche announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million a year for research in the IA.
At the same time, the American legislation which has been working to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians participate in the referendum on the name of their country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia heard their voice in a referendum on the change in the name of their country for the Republic of North Macedonia. This change would resolve an old dispute over decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of the provinces known as Macedonia, maintains that the name of its neighbor in the north represents a right in its territory and has opposed its veto to its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but the nationalists argue that the change would affect the ethical identity of the Macedonian slave population, the majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote at the referendum and that a boycotting campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a minimum participation of 50% required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: "Are you for accession to NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?"
According to the name change participants, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to be paid to join organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, saved from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that she can live freely under the auspices of the European Union. This means a safer life for each of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have stated that they would follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16%, while it reached 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, which had mobilized 66% of the voters registered at the end of the vote.
"I have come to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the change of name in order to open the vote for accession to NATO and the European Union, Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In Parliament, in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small scene and has seats in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter it through the big door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in the Eurasian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, accession to NATO will allow Macedonia to receive necessary investments.
"I think a large majority will be favourable, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO," said Zaev after submitting his bulletin.
He added that a "yes" would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a poll published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would have the intention to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the expected participation rate.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian chain Telma, estimated participation to be 57%.
70 per cent of the voting participants stated that they would vote "yes".
In order for the referendum to be valid, 50 per cent more votes are required.
The failure of the referendum would be the first severe blow to the pro-Western government's policy since its takeover in May last year.
Decisive action: Sergio Aguero, from Manchester City, takes a path through Brighton's defense to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated the defenders of Brighton in Manchester and won the match 2-0 Saturday, at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
The aim of Aguero, at the 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action of the world for the player.
The Argentine butter received the balloon in the middle of the field at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before drowning in the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green petals.
He turned on a defender before he defeated the others near Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling, on his left.
The previous Englishman took advantage of this to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to cheat the guard of Brighton, Mathew Ryan, with a shot on the right side of the string.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," explained Pep Guardiola, team coach, to journalists.
"We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We had the chance that he had noticed at the moment."
But it was Sterling who had given the first advantage to Skyblues at the First League game,
from 29 minutes.
Aguero received the balloon directly on Brighton's ground.
He sent it on the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few hits before taking Sterling to the second pole.
The front of the Skyblues sent the balloon in the rows just before sliding out of the field.
City will face Hofenheim in the Champions League group at 12.55 pm on Tuesday at the Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the Rockies Troubles
Since the Nationals team was eliminated from the play-off race, there was no reason to get involved in a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play against the Rockies of Colorado on Sunday, but only in the event of an elimination match for the Rockies, real legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers Division of the Western National League.
The Rockies took him 5-2 in front of the Nationals Friday night, but they still seek to secure their first division title.
"Even though this game has no issue, we want to explore the field in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and face a team that will probably play at the highest level I will have to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce a release launcher for Sunday, but they would be inclined to leave the place in Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th departure, will be training Thursday and launch during his usual rest day Sunday.
The Washington right-hand side is 18-7 with an average score of 2.53 and 300 withdrawals on 220 marches and two thirds this season.
Trump's interventions in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation that contributed to Brett Kavanaugh's support for the Supreme Court by discussing the importance of Republicans' participation in the mid-term elections.
“ All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's a major issue. I'm not a candidate, but I'm more involved than ever. That's why I fight on all fronts for terrible candidates," he said.
Trump went on "You see this terrible, really horrible radical group of democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They are concerned about who they hurt, who they burn to take power and control. That's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give them."
Democrats are in the mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"You can see it in the last four days," he added, before qualifying the democrats of people "in anger, evil and lying."
He referred to the Judicial Committee of the United States Senate and Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which was worth avoiding from the public.
"Do you remember his answer? "
Did you disclose the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm waiting for one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party was no longer the great community.
It is not tolerant of those who express their ideas
When activists of the Momentum movement of my local party voted to censor me, it was not a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of parliamentarians of the working party considered not to be welcome.
My colleague Joan Ryan received identical treatment because she was raised against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I was censored because I was in disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are matters for which Jeremy himself disagreed with the previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour meeting said on Friday: "We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
That is exactly what the General Assemblys of Friday night during my eight years as a parliamentary member of the Labour Party were.
Unfortunately, today this is not the case with many meetings and the promise of softer and more respectful policies has been forgotten for a long time, if it has never been taken into account.
It has become clear that the contrary opinions are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptability by the party's leaders.
This started shortly after Jeremy took power, and colleagues with whom I thought to share a same political vision began to expect me to return to my dress and to take a stand against my convictions, whether in terms of national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I spoke in public, and no matter what I said, I was following an abusive crackdown on social networks, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, saying that I should not be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
Moreover, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that were addressed to me were of a political nature.
I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a disparity of sexist or racist talk every day, but who do not lower their arms.
One of the most disappointing things in the current policy is the normalization of various forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the working party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this great community and that the party is restricted by the motions of opposition and changes in the rules of selection.
I have been given a lot of advice over the past two years: lowering my eyes, not expressing my ideas so strongly, and everything would be fine.
But it's not about acting like I'm doing politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolgirl, because the neglect of Thatcher's government had led to the collapse of my classroom. Since then, I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as local advisor or government minister.
I never hid my political ambitions, even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been disturbed by my political positions and my disputes with the party's current leaders.
All I would like to say to those who have defended Friday's motion is that the country is going to a Brexit that will affect the homes, businesses and public services. I think that is not really the time to lose time and energy by discussing my loyalty to the party's leader.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my electors whether they are workers or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will prevent me from acting for the reasons I defend, which are your interests to all.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose : Father Remains Invincible
Two late trials may have faked the final result, but no doubt above: Ayr deserved this victory following the intense day match of the Scotland Rupby Championship in XV.
The team now occupys the top of the ranking and becomes the only invaginated team of the championship.
Finally, it is the superiority of their defense and the way in which they have seized the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can congratulate himself on this game.
"So far, we have been tested, but we remain invaincus, so I must love me happy!" he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, congratulated Ayr: "Bravo to them, they were more effective than us and could seize opportunities."
Grant Anderson's trial, at the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow card for the Scottish squad Rory Hughes, released for the Warriors' game, allowed Melrose to make the figures speak. Jason Baggot got away with an unprocessed trial.
Climo aggravated the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the middle of the time. He marked and transformed a solo trial to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr at break.
Melrose began the second half and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
It was followed by a long wait due to a serious injury by Ruarid Knott, who left the field on a cemetery. During the resumption, Ayr took the lead with a trial by Stafford McDowall transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, acting captain of Ayr, then received a yellow cardboard and again Melrose tried his chance with an unprocessed trial by Bruce Colvine, who created a palpable tension.
But the home team got back in hand and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to hit Climo while he didn't have the ball, since the penalty hit, MacPherson touched the back of Ayr's disease, which progressed.
Climo turned the test, like almost every time since the resumption, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's kick box and sent Gregor Henry's wing away for the fifth trial of the home team.
The Still Game star launches in the restoration
Ford Kieran, the Still Game star, decided to make a career in the restaurant. The comedian was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old incarne Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he wrote and coanimates with his long-standing partner, Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the ninth show will be the end of the show, and Kiernan seems to prepare for the next Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is Director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although a source from the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to be involved in the "flowering environment of restoration" in Glasgow.
"The sea is with us": Bolivia, blocked, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol in a ship in the ship's ship's ship's headquarters, La Paz.
Public buildings are building a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the marine bases show the following motorcycle: "The sea returns to us from the right.
Recovery is a duty."
Throughout the blocked Bolivia, the memory of a lost coast to Chile's benefit in a 19th-century bloody resource conflict is always well present. Like the desire to navigate the Pacific Ocean, once again.
These hopes have not been so palpable for decades. Bolivia is indeed awaiting a decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be delivered on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course awaits a positive outcome," explains Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will vote in favour of Bolivia's application. Bolivia wishes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile will be required to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign passage to the ocean in Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the indigenous charismatic president of Bolivia (who faces a fight controversial for the election next year), also has much to say about the decision that will be made on Monday.
"We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts think there is little chance that the court will vote in favour of Chile, and that little would change, even in the case of a positive decision.
The United Nations-based forum in the Netherlands did not have the power to agree on a Chilean territory, and provided that it would not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice makes its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case "was not complicated", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from promoting Bolivia's cause, the past four years may have even caused harm to her.
"The problem of access to the sea was diverted by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
The fighting rhetoric of Morales has spared all the good Chilean will that remained, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that, it will be very difficult to organize talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in Haye, rejected the idea that the Court's decision was abnormally rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a great opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also challenged the fact that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the maritime problem as a quiet policy.
"Bolivia will never abandon its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The Court's decision is an opportunity to see that we must defeat the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will take place only when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, said that his country would not take advantage of his nuclear weapons until he had confidence in Washington.
R expressed itself on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to comply with the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two river countries.
He expressed himself when the Secretary of State of the United States Mike Pompeo appeared on the point of relaunching nuclear diplomacy over three months after the summit of Singapore with Kim Jong One, current North Korea leader.
Ri states that it is "chemical" to think that the maintenance of the sanctions and opposition of the United States to a declaration that will put an end to the Korean war will make the North.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement in the absence of significant disarmament measures on the part of Pyongyang.
Kim and President of the United States Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang's serious rejection of an arsenal that the country considers to be the only guarantee of its security is being debated.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion parades reveal the latest trends in cover, perhaps soon available in your shops
If you want to add XXL pieces to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun at 100%, don't look any more.
The creators Valentino and Thom Browne presented their oversized hat collections at a PE19 show that honored the style of the Fashion Week in Paris.
More and more extravagant hats each other invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to integrate their delirious pieces into the parades.
Valentino's pheasant was an eccentric beige hat decorated with a broad edge that evoked a pen, which swallowed the head of the mannequins.
The other oversize accessories included paired jewelry pastries, a sorceress hat and even a pineapple. But these pieces were not designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most masks had curly lips and spoke more of Hannibal Lecter than the High-Couture.
One creation was like a floating equipment, with tuba and glasses, while another was thinking of a deep-glazed cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you're lucky.
According to style observers, capillaries could come to your shopping streets.
.The XXL hats follow the "Bomba" sillage, the wide-ranging straw hat that the stars are pulling, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that commercializes this difficultly portable hat that has flooded social networks has presented another of its phare creations on the podium: a beach bag in straw almost as large as the mannequin in bathrobe that carried it.
The burned orange rafia bag, decorated with rafia strawberries and a white leather handle, was the master's room of the show PE19 La Riviera de Jacquemus at the Fashion Week in Paris.
The Stylist of the Celebrates Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the great hats and beach bags arriving in the trades for the next summer. The creator so marked the spirits that it is obvious that there will be demand for surplus accessories."
John Edward: skills in languages are essential to the citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland maintain a school excellence record. This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent review results reinforced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector capable of designing and implementing an over-the-counter school programme, we find that contemporary languages remain popular and desirable materials in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you speak to his heart. ”
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to create relationships and build a trust relationship with the inhabitants of other countries.
If you look at the excellent results of this year's exams, you can see that the languages are high in classification, with the most important success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest score, A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received the highest score, A, Mandarin, as well as 72% of students who studied German, 69% who studied French and 63% who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Today, languages as materials are organized as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in programmes of independent schools and other schools.
A UK Employment Commission survey and skills carried out in 2014 reveals that 17% of the difficulties encountered by employers in recruiting candidates are related to skills in languages that are insufficient.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more job offers requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalised world.
No matter what career you choose, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real advantage in the future thanks to this lasting competence.
The ability to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of its competitors.
According to a survey by YouGov conducted in 2013 with 4,000 adults living in the United Kingdom, 75% of them did not have enough foreign language to hold a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
That is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will be better able to find a rewarding job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Several of them will focus on traditional contemporary languages, while others will teach relevant languages for the United Kingdom in the 2020 perspective, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with a specialist in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to offer a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future reserves them.
It is obvious that languages remain of major importance for the future of the country at present in a global commercial environment, which must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the Scottish youth.
It needs to be done.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
The Bron will start with the Lakers on Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the fans who look at LeBron James' beginnings at the Lakers of Los Angeles.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, announced that James would play Sunday, in the opening of the pre-season, against the Denver Nuggets, in San Diego.
But we don't know how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one, less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
The reporter of Lake Trudell's Lakers tweeted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After the training, earlier this week, James was asked for his projects for the pre-season program, which includes six games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need preseason games to be ready."
Trump's campaign in West Virginia (Canadian YouTube)
President Donald Trump launches a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other steps, including in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the President is popular, are planned.
The vote to confirm the vacancy at the Supreme Court is postponed, Trump seeks to collect support for the mid-term elections to come and to prevent Republicans from losing control of Congress during the vote in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
The Trump meeting in Wheeling, in West Virginia, is scheduled for 19.00 a.m. (East Time) this evening, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump should address the question of the candidate's hearings at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate should be postponed until one week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings is aimed at helping the Republicans to win the field for the November elections.
According to Reuters, the President of the United States said in his campaign that the five meetings were intended to "encourage volunteers and partisans while the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they hold in the Senate and in the House of Representatives".
"Congrès control is so essential to its programme that the President will become the largest number of States possible at the beginning of this election campaign," Reuters said a spokesman for the Trump team, who refused to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, this evening's meeting, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena of Wheeling, could bring together participants from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media".
Saturday, this will be the second visit in a month of Trump in West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump tries to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is on the train in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to try to restart him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political science specialist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team is ready to fight to keep hope in the approach of the simple Sunday
After three simple, Saturday afternoon's foursomes could well represent what was missing from this Ryder Cup.
The Elean balance movement is a sports concept invented of all parts but to which players sincerely believe, and more than ever in tournaments like this.
So where would they be, right now?
"They ate six points in advance and now four, so this gives us some wings," said Jordan Spieth as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage of, of course, with four points in advance and twelve others to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, feel a little bit of the wind in the dome and have every reason to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can pretend to have got every three points on four.
Spieth has shown himself to be extremely effective in the green tea and gives an example.
The screams of energetic joy intensified as his game progressed. A crucial well allowed him to equal the fourth part while Thomas and he were taken two down after two holes.
His well, thanks to which they won the match at the 15th hole, caused a similar scream, of those who tell you that he believes the American team is still in high school.
“We really need to stay determined and focus on his game,” Spieth said.
That's all there's left to each of these players right now.
18 holes to mark.
The only players who have scored more points than Spielth and Thomas during the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as a witness to the story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple won four games on four and did not have the right to make a mistake.
Not only "Moliwood" were the only ones not to realize a Saturday afternoon bowey, but they also escaped there Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the last nine doors Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to circulate between them and the crowd by scattering them as the players to beat Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to win a potential European victory while the sun lies on the National Golf.
Preferably, both at the same time to different holes.
But speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's football, while he was teaming with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine hits sent Spain and Sweden into a hole they had never been able to detect.
On the other hand, no one is here to help you on Sunday.
The furballs and fursomes are so fascinating to observe closely because of the interactions between the peers, the advice they give and those they do not give, and the way a strategy can bask in an eyebrow.
Europe has played a better team so far and has made considerable progress during the last day, but this forum session has also proved that the Americans have the courage to fight, some of which had doubts, especially in the country.
Europe runs 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit from a solid advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 on the United States during the Saturdays and the Saturdays.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took charge of two victories on a Tiger Woods in distress, allowing them to mark four points so far.
Well decided to maintain the title she had lost in Hazeltine two years ago, the European team of Thomas Bjorn made the difference by imposing 3-1 in the morning's furballs, against a disoriented American team.
The United States has demonstrated greater resistance in the foursomes and has won two victories, but they have failed to overcome the gap.
Jim Furyk's men must necessarily drop eight points on Sunday 12 on simple to preserve the trophe.
Fleetwood is the first European recruit to unwind four points, while Molinari and he, named Molliwood after a failing weekend, are only the second pair of Ryder Cup's history to get four points at their first four matches.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed during the four-balls, they beat the pair made up of American beginner Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired by an even more categorical 5 and 4.
Woods, who turned on during the two Saturday matches, shined on a few occasions, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and seven fans.
Justin Rose, well rested for the morning's football, teamed with Henrik Stenson in the forums, winning 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively, numbers one and three in the world ranking.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in southwestern Paris, under a fresh but exhausted time.
The triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas drew up the reference for the Americans by marking two points Saturday.
They won a well-deserved victory at 2-1 against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, those who lost the first two holes.
Twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a four-point gap in simple, although the Furyk team, who held the crown, had nothing more than to do a zero match to preserve its trophe.
After being second for two days, however, they could not give up a Sunday attack.
North Korea states that disarmament will not be "no" unilaterally untrustworthy.
On Saturday, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs told the United Nations that the maintenance of sanctions would strengthen his confidence in the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally in these circumstances.
At the annual General Assembly of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho stated that North Korea had last year taken "significant measures of good will", such as ending nuclear and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear testing site and its commitment not to proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding responses from the United States," he regretted.
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, under such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to unarm ourselves unilaterally."
While reiterating the well-known complaints of North Korea concerning Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, which would reward North Korea if it gradually took action, its statement proved important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump, made on 12 June in Singapore at the first summit between an American president in the exercise and a North Korean leader, when Kim undertook to work for a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking to officially put an end to the Korean war (1950-1953), but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first renounce his nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused requests to alleviate severe international sanctions against North Korea.
the United States insists that North Korea first proceed to denuclearization and stress the pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve their goal in a coercive manner, even contrary to "the declaration of the end of war".
"Those who think that these sanctions can make us suffer do not know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our distrust."
Ri made no comment on the second summit between Kim and Trump launched before the United Nations by the US leader earlier this week.
Rather, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the part concerned by the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such an impasse."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from that of last year, when he had stated before the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korean missiles in the North American territory after President Trump described Kim as a "missile man" in a suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened the United Nations last year to "completely destroy" North Korea, did not commend this year for the courage with which Kim has applied measures for disarmament, but added that there was still much to be done and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea disarmed.
Wednesday, Trump said that no time had been set. "It can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter," he said.
China and Russia maintain that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last Thursday stated to the United Nations Security Council that: "The application of the sanctions of the Security Council must be firmly and systematically maintained until total, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to stifle the financing of Pyongyang nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri on behalf of the United Nations General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
This year, Pompeo has already been in North Korea three times, but his last trip was a bit disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang by asserting that progress had been made, but in the hours that followed, North Korea denounced its " gangster methods".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
According to the South Korean President, Kim claims the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students take rest courses
This year, Harvard University has set up a new course that allows all first-cycle students to sleep more and fight the growing masquerade trend that is to study caffeine throughout the night.
One professor noted that most students in the best university in the world do not know how to take care of them
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is said to be the first of the kind in the United States.
It was after giving a conference on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea had come to it.
At the end, a student approached me and said, "Why am I only told this in the last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
Spended for the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their school and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director General of the University's Health Services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that the students suffered from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The course time consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dortoire containing various objects (caffee, dishes, basketball, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of the lack of sleep on their physical performances and the importance of integrating a routine before bedtime.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, AVC, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
However, we think they have the right to know this information - the same way you have the right to know what the effects of smoking on health are," Professor Czeisler added.
According to him, the culture of pride of having “a white night” still exists, and it adds that modern technology and constant pressure on students make sleeping a growing problem.
Having sufficient sleep and good quality should be the "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, has he said - even to avoid taking weight, because the lack of sleep makes the brain in in-initiation, making them hungry forever.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year in Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes and had moved him to insist that he be offered to the whole campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to propose to all third-cycle students to follow a similar study programme before joining the recognized institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students provide an alarm both for the hour of sleep and for the time of awakening, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which may disturb their circadian rhythm and cause sleep disturbances.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Menga's goal is to bring down Gerrard's men
The Rangers went on a new hard strike outside, the Dolly Menga attack, which led Steven Gerrard's disarmed team in Livingstone to a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox team was hoping to record its first victory in the move since its 4-1 triumph in St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team attacked Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as a coach, leaving his team on the move, eight points behind the Hearts, lords of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before the mid-time and the Rangers team, short of inspiration, failed to equalize.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingstone rises in third position, just behind Hibernate on the difference of goals.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, the arbitrator Calum Spence, who had to be treated for a head injury following the throw of an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team, which hit Ayr in the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, as for him, chose the same Livi 11 who raised a point in the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team kicking his opponents on every turn.
The Rangers may have mastered the balloon's possession, but Livingstone has done more.
They had to mark in two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the field environment left his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then shot a powerful blow in the direction of Captain Craig Halkett, but his co-equipmentist Alan Lithgow could only reach the second pot.
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he should have been penalized after the French blow when Steven Lawless and he got in conflict with him, but Arbitrary Steven Thomson dismissed Colombia's requests.
The Rangers only took advantage of two shots in the first period, but the former guardian of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was hardly disturbed by Lassana Coulibally and a hit by Ovie Ejaria.
If the opening of the score by Livi at the 34th minute registered against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it by their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed to face Jacobs' stopping kick.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his blood cool to choose Menga for a simple purpose.
Gerrard reacted half-time by replacing Coulibally with Ryan Kent and the exchange failed to have an immediate impact when the eagle appeared before Morelos, but impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingstone continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett dancing long dances on long dances.
Holt's team could have taken advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor took a good break to get rid of Jacobs before Lithgow passed the goal.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while he was in custody with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored it again.
Germanach: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page by our Germanach "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and THE COMPTEUR TOURNE... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity; an invention that subsequently gave birth to the device known as Geiger Count.
Since then, the Count Geiger has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
One man said, "What's that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it's used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
Thanks to these listeners, you can really hear the effects of the atoms released in the minerals by radioactivity."
Evans: "So, of course it does, here!"
“ Hans ” Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd anniversary.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to detect cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to detect and kill cancer cells
During treatment, the vaccine indicates to the immune system how to recognise cancer cells
This technique is to extract and modify immune cells from a patient in the laboratory
They can then "discover" a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then re-injected
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose aim is to learn the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract and modify immune cells from a patient, so they can detect HER2, common to many cancers, and finally reinject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute of Cancer based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
According to Professor Berzofsky, HER2 protein “makes an increase in several types of cancer”, including breast, ovary, pulmonary and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, consisting of taking immune cells to "learn" them to target cancer cells, has been demonstrated in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Coffee of a MAGA casket, Kanye West started in a Pro-Trup diatribe after his transfer to SNL.
This has not happened.
Kanye West moved on to the platform after a failed performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump during a Saturday Night Live and announced that he was going to present himself to the elections in 2020.
After his third piece, Ghost Town, which he sang with a helmet Make America Great Again, West took it to the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times, I'm talking to Whites and they say, "How can you love Trump? He's a racist!"
"Well, if racism were to bother me, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL issue began with a sketch by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star scoffed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been distributed, the record of West diatribe was released on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock intended to mock West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour in the shells because of his helmet.
"They pressured me.
They told me not to come with this helmet on my head.
They pressured me!
And then they say I'm in a drawer," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You want to see him, do you want to see him?" and said he would wear his superman coat, because no one can dictate his actions. Do you want the world to progress?
Try love."
His comments attracted him to holes at least twice on the part of the public, and the members of the SNL seemed embarrassed, Variety report. A person on the site said in the magazine: "A death silence has fallen all over the board."
West had been called to replace last minute the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West has disillusioned many people by singing song I Love it in a Perrier bottle costume.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who published the following tweet: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for sticking to the crowd."
But Karen Hunter, the show's animator, tweeted that West was just "loyal to himself, and that it's absolutely wonderful."
"However, I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music, his clothes, or by supporting his art) who, I believe, adopts and evicts a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so do we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change names and follows Diddy's tracks, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg brought the name of Snoop Lion and, of course, the legendary Prince fire, who changed his name into a symbol, then that of the artist previously known as Prince.

Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones series, takes it to the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his final role as a team, Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, the violent, fantastic medieval series of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor took over the stereotype of the macho hero, asserting that this type of role on the screen often leads young boys to get used to being tough for cooking to be respected.
In an interview given to Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that according to him, "something is wrong" and addresses the question of toxic masculinity at the time of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, the covert of Game of Thrones, also 31-year-old, admitted that he was "strongly" on this issue.
"I personally think deeply that we have abused masculinity."
"What lessons have we taught young men who are becoming adults, compared to the problem they are now facing?"
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
He continued: "What behavior is inborn, what behavior was incarcerated?
What does television and street teach young boys who encourage them to think that they should behave like this to be a man?
I think it's really one of the fundamental questions of our time - how can we change this?
There is obviously something that closes.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make prologues or suites when the series ended next summer, claiming that it ended with "the battlefields and horses".
As of November, Kit will be the star of a Resumption of True West, Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that meeting with his wife Rose was for him the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose interpreted Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, in the family domain of Leslie.
HIV / AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China reported an increase of 14 per cent of its HIV/AIDS population.
According to the Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are concerned.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported during the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the patients were contaminated during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus spread rapidly in certain regions of the country following contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected by HIV was practically reduced to zero, according to the Chinese health authorities at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
However, from one year to the other, the number of HIV positive and AIDS victims in China increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, the transmission of HIV through sex is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70% to 90% of homosexual men end up marrying a woman.
The number of transmission cases is due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to address this problem, the Chinese government has since 2003 promised universal access to medicines against HIV.
Maxine Waters laments that an employee of the GOP has disclosed information about senators, and denounces "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
On Saturday, U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denounced the allegations that a member of his team would have published personal information about three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
Los Angeles Democrat stated that these statements were supported by experts and "extremely right" websites.
"Slanders, Lies, and Inflamed Lies," Waters responded in a Twitter statement.
It would seem that the information disclosed included the addresses and phone numbers of the American senators. Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during the Senate meeting on allegations of sexual assault against the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The escape took place some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed information from a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, “this unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie. ”
"The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised because of these false and false allegations, is in no case responsible for the escape of such information."
“ This false claim is completely false and a true lie. ”
Waters' statement quickly provoked online criticism, including Ari Fleischer's part, the former press-attack of the White House.
"This is a disgrace of anger," he wrote.
"This indicates that she does not have the temper necessary to be a member of the Congress.
When a person is accused of something that he has not done, he must not be angry.
She shouldn't be provocative.
It must not challenge the accused's motives.
She has to stay calm and calm. ”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the critics' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of acting too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at Waters headquarters during the mid-term elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's huge," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters indicated that his office had warned "the authorities and services responsible for the implementation of the laws concerned" about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the guilty are exposed," she added, "and that they are held responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team."
Johnny English has yet to strike. Rowan Atkinson Parodie, a suspected spy
It has now become a tradition to search for the scope of Brexit in any new British film and this seems to apply to this resumption of Johnny English action comedy, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic self-satisfaction on the issue of the evidence of our insignificance represent the new chance of exporting our country?
In all cases, the incompetent Johnny English, in the eye of the carnival and face in rubber, saw his licence renewed for the second time in a confused context - this name indicates first of all that it is a great comic created designed for a non-anglophone film audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts of glamorous charm, owns a bit of Clouseau, a suspect of Mr Bean and a good dose of the type that performs a small note in Les Chariots at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
Originally, he is also inspired by the traveler and man of international mystery that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's TV ads, now forgotten, leaving the chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English contains one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached a helicopter while he was wearing a medieval armor and that the rotor's pals hit his helmet briefly.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is appreciated, although humor is rather insufficient and extremely superfluous, especially at a time when "serious" licenses such as 007 and Mission impossible make up themselves in all confidence with comedy.
Humour seems to be more focused on children than on adults, and for me, Johnny English's daring adventures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson's silent film gigs in Bean's character.
The ever-present assumption is that Britain has serious problems.
A computer pirate has infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the great development of the agents in service - a low-scale helium role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the taste that causes the vase to be poured out for a prime minister who is a pumping character on the side of the crisis and who already suffers from a political impoverishment: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself with this almost Teresa-May character, but there is no great deal to be put under his teeth in the scenario.
Its advisors are informed of the information that each active spy has been compromised, that it will have to release some of its retirement.
This means that Johnny English must be disturbed by himself, who is now employed in a chic institution as a school master, but who secretly teaches lessons about how to become a secret agent: a few beautiful farcees here, because English offers an academie of espionage like Rock Academy.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and found Bough, his former long-haired partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey bat role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin, who create great difficulties in His Majesty's secret services, are going through the action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman of Ophelia Bulletin.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously undermining the technological billionaire charismatic which is said to be capable of solving the computer problems of Britain: the worst Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of falsified jokes: under the decoy of servers, they light up a français restaurant; they create chaos by faking on Volta's luxurious flyer; and English triggers a real anarchy when he tries, with a helmet of virtual reality, to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta's house.
All arrests are assured for this last sequence, but there are no bad things for children in all of this.
A rather moderate movie.
I couldn't stop myself from thinking, like for Johnny English's other films: can't the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really enhance his talent?
The Labour Party has failed to draw up a plan so that the British can work for four days but are paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's working party must consider a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week - but to be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the economies generated by artificial intelligence (IA) by giving them an additional day of leave.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, while continuing to pay the same wage.
According to some sources, the idea would be consistent with the party's economic programme and plans to guide the country in favour of workers.
The four-day transition was approved by the trade union congress as a means for workers to benefit from economic change.
An important source within the Labour Party stated in the Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year."
"This will not be done in one night, but a four-day work week is a goal that will match the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for workers as well as its overall industrial strategy."
The Working Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party had engaged in a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party said: "A four-day work week is not a party policy and is not envisaged by the Party."
The deputy Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of the workinglist conference last week to give details on his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
Mr McDonnell stated that he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous administrators" and "beneficiaries" in public utility companies.
The additional chancellor plans also provide that the current shareholders of the water companies may not recover the whole of their deployment as the labour force could operate "deductions" due to alleged misconduct.
It also confirmed its employee integration plan in corporate management boards and the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of the capital of private enterprises to employees, which will cover up to £500 dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy rely on "60 minutes" if the FBI's investigation on Kavanaugh could change their opinion.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court was postponed for at least one week following the FBI's investigation of the charges against him and raised the question of whether the Bureau's findings could encourage Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a Sunday interview, Scott Pelley, the correspondent of the "60 minutes" program, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out what would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“ Of course, ” says Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do that?"
He was resolved, determined, no doubt.”
However, Graham's vote appears to be engraved in the stone.
"I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive charge would have to be made," he said.
"Dr Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it," Graham added, making an allusion to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people she's appointed couldn't verify it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I can't find anything that changes again. ”
What has the Global Citizen Festival done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a very impressive star palm and an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people joining the Great Lawn in Central Park in order not only to benefit from the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real objective of the festival, namely to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, whose first edition took place in 2012, is an extension of Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are ready to pay a VIP ticket), viewers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, send an email to a world leader, telephone or make any other useful effort to raise awareness of the population's fight against poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its objective in the remaining twelve years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with free concert really allow them to be persuaded to demand an appeal for action, or does it represent just another example of "clickivism" - a situation in which people really think of making the difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" on behalf of its participants, who advocate for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped to encourage global leaders to make commitments and to adopt policies that amount to over $37 billion that should change the lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which a tranche of at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group believes that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Among the main commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and executives who committed themselves to "helping children to develop their full potential", while promising to help Rwanda with 35 million Sterling books to end malnutrition in this country after receiving over 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
"Thanks to the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a bottom note in history," said Tracey Ullman, the ambassador of the The Power of Nutrition program at a concert that took place in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, following more than 5,000 actions to request the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the Government announced the funding of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children in nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, "What makes you think it is possible to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the major civil rights defence movements and the fight against apartheid before us, we will get there, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists that will take place this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will enjoy the show.
The United States could appeal to the Navy to create a "block" to stop Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
In order to avoid the arrival of Russian energy in the markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can "if necessary" appeal to the American Navy, Ryan Zinke, the US Secretary of the Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's presence in Syria, including where it operates at the request of the legitimate government, is a pretext that enables it to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that they are in the Middle East in order to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe," he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy it.
"The United States, with our Marine, can ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, must be obstructed in order to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market," he added.
Zinke addressed participants to the Energy Alliance Consumer event, a non-profit organization that is defined as the "wordbook of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are in reality identical.
"As regards Iran and Russia, the economic option is more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, while referring to Russia, saying that it has "more than one string at its arc" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration has committed itself to dynamizing the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia with a much less expensive solution for European consumers.
To this end, representatives of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to leave the project "unappropriate" from the Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin "prisoner" in Moscow.
On several occasions, Moscow stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline of $11 billion, which should double the current capacity to reach 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a speech delivered in September in Moscow following a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Secretary of Energy, Russian Energy Minister Alexandre Novak said "I believe we share this opinion that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers."
The position of the United States has generated negative reactions from Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The main German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to engage in European energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider presenting himself to the 2020 presidential elections, says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections following the mid-term elections.
At a public assembly in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would dream of presenting herself.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for this, a woman will have to be at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider presenting my candidacy to the Presidents."
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public meeting, saying he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump has done to our democracy," she said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and of the candidate at the Supreme Court of the latter, Brett Kavanaugh.
Friday, in a Twitter message, Warren said: "Of course we need an FBI inquiry before we vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters are not of the opinion that it should be presented in 2020.
According to a survey by the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe, 58% of the "probable" electors of Massachusetts claimed that the senator should not appear.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The survey revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supported, with 38% in favour of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Among the other names of highly-spoken Democrats for a potential campaign in 2020 are those of former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden stated that he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's PTSD during Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after its enrolment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"What my own son is currently experiencing, what he feels when he comes back, I can relate it to other families who feel the consequences of the PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are returning with," she told the public at the Donald Trump meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as "the subject of taboo" and said about his son and other former combatants that "they come back a little different, tough, wondering whether they respect what their friends and members of the air force, and each other military, have given to the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Service, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of assault and marital violence on a woman, which interferes with a report of marital violence and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness.
18 States and the District of Colombia are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new asylum policy
18 States and the District of Colombia are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new American policy that denies asylum to victims who flee from a gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives of the 18 States and the district filed a memo in favour of an asylum-seeker who challenged this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions open in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She stated that her partner "and his sons, gang members," had attacked her, but the US authorities decided to reject her asylum application on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
Public prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generated a large number of asylum applications in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang and marital violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy annulled a decision made in 2014 by the Immigration Appeals Council, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing marital violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the District Attorney General of Columbia, stated on Friday in a statement that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law stipulates that all asylum applications must be examined according to the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle," said the curiae friend in his memory.
In addition, lawyers have maintained in the memory that the policy of refusing entry of immigrants is at night in the US economy, claiming that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and to "provide the necessary work".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims of marital violence and gang violence.
"The asylum is granted to people who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political convictions," Sessions said on 11 June in their announcement of that political.
"The asylum has never been designed to alleviate all the problems -- even the most serious -- that people meet every day around the world."
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of double deaths in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly dramatic.
"I feel very inclined," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old family mother, comforting her little festive boy in Palu, in a city's evacuation center.
"At every moment, an ambulance lifts the bodies.
Clean water is rare."
Residents were seen going to their ruined homes, collecting stolen goods, and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake were submerged.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harris, who suffered from a fracture of the back and shoulders, lay in front of Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated outside because of persistent strong replicals.
The tears filled his eyes when he told how he felt the violent earthquake that swept the hotel room to the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris entrusted to Associated Press, stating that his family was in town for a marriage.
"I heard my wife call for help, but after silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "intimacy" through "advertising advertising"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper went through a four-page advertising of the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China in an American daily, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to broadcast propaganda.
US President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday the supplement paid by China Daily in The Moines Register - the most sold in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US parliamentary elections of 6 November, a charge that China rejects.
In accusing Beijing of wanting to interfere in the US elections, Trump noted what American officials have said to Reuters to be a new phase in a growing campaign conducted by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertising in order to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralysed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs to their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, Chinese tariff measures were aimed at hitting exporters of States such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had hurt US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in an opinion article published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "is about to double its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press".
"In the dissemination of its propaganda, the Chinese government serves the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting a paying advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
“On the other hand, in Beijing’s press outlet, you will find little contestant voice and will not see the real reflection of the divergent views Chinese may have on Chinese economic trajectory because the media are strictly obeying the Chinese Communist Party,” he writes.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has avoided publishing" his article, not to mention which newspaper.
Analysts warn that the Republicans are alienating the electorate from the mid-term elections because of the Kavanaugh discharge
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court in a context of allegations of sexual assault, analysts warned that a negative reaction, especially in women, could occur during the next half-mandate elections.
The feelings surrounding this case have been extremely vivid, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they wanted the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse, said "we can't go back."
Reeher added that he suspected that the last-minute efforts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) to investigate the FBI were sufficient to calm the electorate's anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, National Advisor and spokesperson for the Progressive Group MoveOn, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November," she said last September according to Washington's newspaper.
Friday morning, Mic's report, the protesters sang "The month of November comes!" in the round of the Senate, while the Republicans of the Judicial Committee chose to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Enthusiasm and democratic motivation are to be measured," said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
But this could be even higher, especially in the electorate of banners and young voters from 18 to 29 years of age who, even if they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public statement explaining in detail the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court's appointment, analysts left it to believe that the reaction would be likely to be alive if the Republicans made the confirmation progress.
According to NBC News, former president of the National Committee of the Republic, Michael Steele, said at the beginning of last week that "It has become a confused disorder for the GOP".
"It is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote, nor the appointment of Kavanaugh. It is also the way the Republicans managed the situation and the way they dealt with it," noted Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities, a group that helps elected Democrats in the television newspaper.
Following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, however, the Americans appear to be divided on the credibility of the two parties, a small majority on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov revealed that 41 per cent of the people consulted believed in Ford's testimony either or not, while 35 per cent claimed to believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 per cent claimed that Kavanaugh was probably or was absolutely lying during his testimony, while only 30 per cent claimed the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI investigates allegations made by Ford and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, following the pressure of Senator Flake.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judicial Committee that she had been assaulted by Kavanaugh when he was 17 years of age.
Ramirez claims that when they studied in Yale in the 1980s, the candidate in the Supreme Court would have shown him his genital parts during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technological legend, Inrupt, is a society that takes part in the Solid de Berners-Lee free platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and those authorized to access such information.
In an exclusive interview given to Fast Company, Berners-Lee said with pleasure that Inrupt was aimed at "dominating the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the launch.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "on-line personal data store" or DPL.
This may include contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library as well as other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on one browser.
The particularity of the online personal data store is that it belongs entirely to the user to decide which information can be accessed.
The company calls this "personal liability through data".
According to the company's PDG, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company provides adequate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers working on the project and a voluntary community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that his team and his team are not yet in discussion with " Facebook and Google" in order to know if or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely confused in a moment.
"We do not ask permission for them."
In a Saturday article on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that the "mission [d'Inrupt] consists of providing commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid".
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
Over the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Although he has launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a Church of First World War Decorated by the Victoria Cross
The only church of the Church of England to have received the Cross of Victoria during World War I as a combatant was celebrated in its hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, during the attack on Bellenglies and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by an elite shooter four days later and ignored that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
His two grandsons opened a memorial stone at a show in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said that he was "symbolically symbolic" to reveal the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather's exploitation.
According to London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on the Saint Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the violent shooting of cannons of campaign and machine guns".
Later, he rushed on the shooting line and, with the "greatest bravery", drove the line before jumping a canon of campaign to him alone and gathering three soldiers from the detachment.
On October 4, 1918, a German elite shooter killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann, a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his grandfather's actions were "a thing that I will never be, but that makes me humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also filed a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann trusted that he felt "very honored to be part of the show" and added that "the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that will be given to him by many people."
The fans of mixed martial arts stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine that, you spent the whole night looking at a well filled Bellator 206, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San José, the event had 13 fights, six on the main card, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the United Kingdom, on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to face, the United Kingdom TV viewers were huddled when the broadcast changed for Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy to remain awake until the first hours of the morning, especially for the fight.
A Twitter supporter described the passage to animated drawing for children as "a kind of bad joke".
Regarding the transmission, chief marketing and communications vice president of Bellator, Dave Schwartz, said that "the government regulation has that at 6 o'clock in the morning, this content was not adapted, so they had to go back to children's emissions."
"Peppa the Pig," yes.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator's company, said they were going to work on their programming to include British television viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about redistribution, I think we can probably find a solution," Coker said.
"However, it is six hours in the morning one Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday our hour, or Monday their hour.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program went off, there were lots of messages in both ways and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government issue.
I can assure you this won't happen next time.
We will limit ourselves to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to give more for the fans and we did everything we could.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs : Tom Daley felt "low" on the sexuality plan
The Olympic swimmer Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but this inflated him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old man said he didn't realize before going to high school that "everybody wasn't like me."
As part of the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs released by Lauren Laverne, he said he had talked about the issue of the rights of homosexuals to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The usual showcaser, Kirsty Young, took a leave of several months because of her illness.
As a sailor in Laverne's first show, Daley believed that he felt "less than" all the other children growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls".
He said: "Even today, these feelings of being less and different are the real things that have given me the power and strength needed to succeed."
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was "something", did he pursue.
The double Olympic bronze medalist is now a renowned LGBT militant and has taken advantage of his participation this year in the Commonwealth Games in Australia in order to ask a larger number of countries to reduce homosexuality.
He said that he expressed himself because he felt that he was able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world's triple champion claimed that he "did not expect" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married Oscar's 20-year-old winner last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you live so much at such a young age" - he participated in his first 14-year-old Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later - he said he trusted that it was difficult to find a person of the same age who had known the same high and low levels.
In June, they became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, I just thought of winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 following a brain cancer.
Daley trusted that his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he had asked him was whether they had their tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be sitting in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, "Dad, you won't be there anymore to be in the first row," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and he had to stop breathing and he was dead so that I could finally recognize that he was not invincible," he added.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"It was all I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a crowd at the Olympic Games, there's nothing better," he said.
In addition, it inspired her to her first song choice - Proud of Heather Small - who accompanied her during preparations for the Olympics and always gave her chicken flesh.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11.15, BST.
A Mikkelson out of shape on the bank of the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will make a record this Sunday by playing his 47th match of the Ryder Cup, but he will have to recover to avoid it being a miserable step.
Mickelson, who participated in the biannual competition for the 12th time, a record, was separated by Captain Jim Furyk of the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it has so often been for the United States, the five-year-old champion shared his day with the role of supporting and reinvigorating his game in order to remedy his evils.
He was never the biggest of the teenagers, even at the top of his career. At 48 years of age, he is not the most suitable for the difficult Golf National, where the long rough is systematically punishing the hits.
And as if the course wasn't quite reductible, Mickelson, at the 9th Sunday match, faced Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood this week to win their four matches.
If the Americans, four down at the beginning of the 12 simple games, take a good start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his husband, but he couldn't say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a tape in my back, put his arms around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has great confidence in him.
It's a legendary champion and he's added so many things to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I was planning more, but that's what happened and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there, like everyone else."
Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record of the largest number of meetings of Ryder Cup disputes.
This could mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that has never really reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven tenths, although Furyk has stated that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to mock people, and he's a terrible guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had the pleasure of measuring themselves to him this week, which was fun to see.
It does much more than play. ”
European selection captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows by experience that a non-negotiable advance before the very last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a painful course.
The Danish played his first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team with the captain Sve Ballesteros had five points of advance on the Americans, but finally raised himself in the head of the ranking with the smallest possible deviation on the line of arrival, carrying it 141 1⁄2-131 1⁄2.
"You don't stop recalling that we led widely in Valderrama; we had a big advance in Brooklyn, where we failed, as well as in Valderrama, where we won, but in justice," Bjorn said, after observing the 2018 Classification to win the victory 5-3 both Friday and yesterday in the National Golf to drive 10-6.
The story will prove to me and all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Get down there tomorrow.
Go and do whatever you need to do.
It's not over before you get the points on the table.
We have a goal, namely to try to win this trophe, and that's where we need to stay focused.
I have always said to focus on the 12 players in our camp, but we are very aware of what is going on on the other side - they are the best players in the world."
Ravi of the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never advance on this point.
Tomorrow, it's another pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, these are the individual performances that will be presented and it goes otherwise.
It's fantastic to be with a teammate when things go well, but when you're there alone, you're put to the test of your full capacity as a golfer.
Here's the message to get to the players, it's to get the best out of you tomorrow.
When we leave his partner behind, he must go get the best of himself, too."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players get better results individually than as teammates, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have scored three points on four.
Furyk himself experienced the two extremes of these last-day revisions, after being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing the outcome of the "Medinah Miracle", where Europe took the victory.
“I remember every word,” he explained in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, had done to attract his players on the last day.
"We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick departure as you saw it in Brooklyn, as you saw it in Medina.
This dynamic, when it goes in a sense, weighs a lot of pressure on the games in the middle.
We have established our training as a result and put the men as we plan to do it, we are trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of conducting the counterattack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the highest half of the ranking.
"I've accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole course," Bjorn said about his selections in simple.
The new German warship is still under way.
According to local media, the new German Navy fleet had to be put into service in 2014 to replace the old warships dating from the cold war, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to defective systems and exponential expenses.
According to the Die Zeit newspaper, which cites a military spokesman, the deployment of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the Admiralship of all the new frogs of Bade-Wurtemberg, was postponed in the first half of 2019.
The ship should have integrated the Marine in 2014, but the worrying problems that occurred after delivery have compromised the fate of this ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Bade-Wurtemberg class ordered by the Marine in 2007 will replace the ageing frogs of the Bremen class.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-navir missiles, as well as some stolen technologies, such as a radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the most recent fractures for a period of up to two years outside the docking ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the incessant delays mean that pre-war ships - which should allow Germany to design its extra-marriage force - will already be exhausted when they are put into service.
Last year, the F125 Maudite F125 made the big headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the shipyard Blohm & Voss, Hamburg.
It was the first time the Marine returned a ship to a ship manufacturer after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were not known, but the German media mentioned a number of “software and material defects” that made the warship useless in the event of deployment in combat missions.
Software defects were particularly important as the Bade-Wurtemberg ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 marines, which corresponds to half of the crews of the old Bremen crew.
In addition, it appears that the ship is considerably overloaded, which reduces its performance and reduces the marine's ability to make future improvements.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tonnes is estimated to be twice as heavy as the Germans used in the Second World War.
Beyond the failures of the computer system, the project price as a whole - including crew training - also becomes a problem.
It is said that it has reached the astronomical sum of 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), compared with 2.2 billion at the outset.
The problems associated with the new fractals are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval force is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, earlier this year acknowledged that the Marine is in fact "short of ships able to deploy".
The responsible stated that the situation had caused a snowball effect over time, as the old ships had been decommissioned but no replacement ships had been designated.
He regretted that none of the Bade-Wurtemberg guys could join the Navy.
The National Trust oversees the secret life of mice
New research carried out in an area of Scotland's Highlands is seeking to reveal how the mice use the landscape in their search for food.
Observations are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will guide future conservation activities.
The study of the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipelines as well as long-eared brown and Daubenton holes in the Inverewe garden in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the sewers throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional analysis of its results will determine the frequency of storm crises as well as the activities of the different species.
A map and a habitat report will be prepared to draw up a detailed picture of their behaviour at the territory level.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Adviser for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important habitat areas for mice and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management such as the creation of meadows and the best way to preserve forests for herring and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the slum populations have decreased considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development efforts that affect the pathogens and result in the loss of their habitat.
Eolithics and lighting can also pose a risk, as can kill-mouse papers and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks of company cats.
The mice are not really blind.
However, given their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS is responsible for the protection of over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country.
He has ten trained experts, who carry out regular surveys, search inspections and sometimes rescues.
In addition, the organization has established the first and only reserve of Scotland's tails on the site of Thrave in Dumfries- and Galloway, which covers eight of the 10 species of Scotland's tails.
David Thompson, the domain manager, claims that the site is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Thrave, we have an ideal place for mice," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is still much to learn about mice, so much so that the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what mice need to prosper."
It underlines the importance of checking the presence of mice before the maintenance of the properties, because by destroying it without wanting a single motherhood nest, one can cause the death of 400 women and children, even the disappearance of a whole local population.
The mice are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, or destroy their pathogens.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scotland's responsibility for the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We still have much to learn about our tails and about many of our species, we do not know what is happening in their populations for the moment."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape while his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape charges against him as “false information, ” claiming that people“ want to get to know themselves by using his name. ”
His lawyers are ready to continue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Youth was accused of violating an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He would then have paid her $375 000 to keep quiet on this incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Addressing her 142 million fans in an online video on Instagram, a few hours after the allegations, Ronaldo, 33 years of age, described this information as "false information".
« No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information," the five-year-old winner of the Gold Ballon told the camera.
“ They want to make themselves public by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to pursue Der Spiegel on these allegations, which they have described as "unacceptable denunciation of suspicions in the field of private life".
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage of a amount proportionate to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of the human rights of the past few years".
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009 following the Palms Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a box at night, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape would occur, according to documents filed with the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and assured him to be a "good guy" to "99%", but that he did not know what was going on with the remaining "1%".
The documents claimed that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sexual relations, but that they were agreed upon.
Mayorga also claimed that she had returned to the police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently accepted a settlement to the friend because she felt "feared by reprisals" and feared "to subject herself to public humiliation".
This 34-year-old woman claims that she is now seeking to cancel this regulation because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join the Royal Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged aggression, and this summer he joined the Italian Juve giant as part of a 100 million euro contract.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would "never regret" the departure of car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Commerce, the United Kingdom would "never regret it" if it had just lost its world leader in car construction after Brexit.
He added that it was "disquieting" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby, if Britain withdrew from the EU without an agreement.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the impact of delays at the border in the possibility of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, which manufactures Auris and Avensis vehicles in Toyota, built nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90 % of which were exported to the other countries of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their fear of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW indicates that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that car manufacturers are at risk for the Brexit supply chain without agreement.
The production line of Toyota is operated in "tendu flow", the parts come every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for the vehicles manufactured on command.
If, on 29 March, the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement, there could be disturbances at the border which, according to industry, could result in delays and loss of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory for more than a day at her Derbyshire factory, said the company, so production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Chequers plan on future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid these border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that will allow, as I said, not only to benefit from the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said in the BBC's Radio 4's Today.
"The evidence, not only of Toyota but of other manufacturers, is that we must be absolutely able to maintain what has become an excellent set of supply chains."
If Toyota was unable to specify how long production would be stopped, it warned that in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and end up costing jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the coordinator of the United Trade Union at the factory, who has been working for 24 years in Burnaston, said that his members were increasingly concerned: "After my experience, once these jobs are gone, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a specific and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
The White House announces that Trump and Rosenstein's meeting could still be delayed
According to the announcement made on Sunday by the White House, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "rested for a week", while the fight for the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees Robert Mueller's work, the special adviser responsible for investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump's collaborators and Russia and the possible obstacles to the justice exercised by the president.
The question of whether Trump will or will not return the Deputy Attorney General, and therefore endangers Mueller's independence, he has been feeding rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken with a micro in order to record the talks with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, on Monday, he presented himself to the House-Blanche, while he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump indicated that he would "do not" refer Mr. Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed in order to avoid confrontation with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Commission before which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford had testified, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into complaints against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate's vote.
On Sunday, Trump's press release, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance at Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been fixed for this, it could be this week, I could see if we're giving up another week given all the other things that happen to the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I like to keep the press informed."
The claim would be challenged by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has held no press conference at the House-Blanche.
Animator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the rareness of the conferences was not due to an aversion for "demagogic" television reporters, although she said, "I have nothing to do with the fact that they are ruining the gallery."
Then she let me know that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
Without quoting any evidence, she added that "the president participates in more questions-response sessions than any other president before him": "We have checked the figures."
Press conferences will always take place, Sanders said, but "If the press is able to question the President of the United States directly, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to do so frequently, you have seen it well in recent weeks, and this will take the place of a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States."
On a regular basis, Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It is rare that there are press conferences on the ground.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a discontracted appearance and at times a strange appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
On Brexit's fears, the Secretary of Health wrote to EU workers in NHS Scotland
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude for the country and to wish to remain in office after Brexit.
The Scottish Parliamentarian Jeane Freeman sent a letter within a period of less than six months before the United Kingdom did not withdraw from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the cost of status applications for European citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "In the summer, the withdrawal negotiations continued between the United Kingdom and the EU and should reach decisions this autumn.
But the British government has also intensified its preparations in the event of a lack of agreement.
I understand that this period must be very disturbing for each one of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate my appreciation for the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that consolidate and improve the work of health services, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is exactly your home and we really want you to stay here."
After having suffered a headache, Christian Abercrombie undergoes an emergency surgery
According to Mike Organ, Tennessee State, Christian Abercrombie, the second of Tennessee Tigers, was operated urgently after an injury to the head on Saturday during the defeat of Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27.
Rod Reed, the state chief coach of Tennessee, told reporters that the injury had occurred just before the mid-term.
"It came on the touch line and collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel have administered oxygen in Abercrombie on the touch line before placing it on a tank and taking it to another test.
A representative from Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of the Vanderbilt Medical Center operating room.
Harris pointed out that there were "no specifics yet on the type or extent of the injury" and that the State of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year athletic student, is in her first season with the State of Tennessee after her transfer from Illinois.
He had five posters in total on Saturday before getting out of the game, which brought his total from the season to 18 posters.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp right if they purchase a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamps if they purchase a property in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help the homeless in the context of the new conservative regimes
This measure will cancel the success of the campaign by Corbyn to attract young voters
Increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to collect up to 120 million Sterling books per year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp fee if they buy a property in the United Kingdom - the additional money will help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This measure will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by undertaking to provide more affordable housing and target people with high incomes.
The increase in stamp law will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will help strengthen the government's efforts to help homeless people.
This surplus - which is added to the current stamp law, including the highest levels established two years ago on secondary residences and purchases - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to collect up to 120 million Sterling books per year.
About 13% of London's new constructions are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which increases prices and prevents prime-accidents from taking a place on the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "phantom cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy occurs only a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the right to stamp in order to help young people acquire a first house.
Accusing the large construction companies to maintain the real estate prices at a high level by cleaning land without using them, he invited Ms. May to give up quotas on affordable housing in order to settle the "unlawful real estate" in the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of reform proposals in the housing sector, including the control of rents and the removal of "free" evictions.
He also wishes to give the councils more extensive power to build new homes.
Ms. May said: "Last year, I said that I would dedicate my position as prime minister to the rebirth of the British dream - that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to all those who want to live, work and build a life here.
It is, however, unfair that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, to buy a house as for British residents who work hard.
For many too many people, the dream of accessing the property has become distant and the misery of homeless remains too real."
Jack Ross: My final ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland's technician, Jack Ross, explains that his "last ambition" is to become the Scottish selector at a given time.
The 42-year-old Scotland is pleased to meet the challenge of reinvigorating the North-East Club, which now occupies the third place of League 1, at three points of the leader.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the First League Scotland last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that's all," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sports Sound.
"But I grew up following the Scottish games in Hampden with my father and that's one thing I've never forgotten.
This opportunity would appear, on the other hand, only if I succeeded in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's voters are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former technician says he has not hesitated to rank behind such emblematic names in such a big club, having already declined the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question "can I bring this club back to the First League?"
From the structure and infrastructure of this club, it certainly belongs to the First League," he added.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably not think of myself as a success here unless I can get the club back there."
Ross has only three years of career as a coach, after a period as a assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months in Hearts coaches.
He then helped Alloa to get back from a third division and turned St. Mirren, who was on the side of the relegation, into the great winner of the championship next season.
Ross is now more comfortable than in his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Alloa's responsibility "was without a doubt a real carpentry," he recalls.
"I really felt that being a coach was better than playing.

The summer canyon made British pubs' incomes more difficult, but increased the pressure on the restaurant chains.
The figures indicate that bar groups and pubs recorded an increase of 2.7% of their sales in July, but revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8.
Peter Martin, of the CGA's Board of Directors, who compiled the data, said: "Sustainable lighting and longer participation than expected from England at the World Cup caused that July followed the June model, where bars had increased by 2.8%, except for restaurants, which had suffered even more significant shock.
The fall of 1.8 per cent recorded in June in the restoration sector was only made in July.
The pubs and bars where alcoholic drinks are served are the most in vogue, with more points of similarity than the restaurants that fall.
Food pubs have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to get out of a glass.
In pubs and bars, liquor sales increased by 6.6% over the month and food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, a specialist analyst in leisure and RSM hotel, said: "These results follow the trend observed since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sports events remain the most important factors in the sale of the home market.
It is not surprising that the restoration groups continue to experience difficulties, however a decrease of 4.8 per cent on an annual average is particularly painful, in addition to continuous cost pressures.
The long and warm stay could not have been less suitable for food business operators and time will tell us if the more moderate temperatures that we experienced in August will give us a well-deserved return."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the implantation.
Industry sales are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector, which collects and analyzes the performance data of 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than 9 billion Sterling books and constitutes the standard in the established industry.
On social media, a child in five has secret accounts he hides to his parents
According to one survey, a child in five - some of whom are only 11 - has secret accounts on social media that he hides to his parents and teachers
A survey conducted with 20,000 secondary students revealed an increase in "False Insta" pages
The news highlighted concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students reported having a "main" account to show their parents
A child in five - some of whom are only 11 - opens an account on the social media that he keeps hidden in adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students revealed rapid growth of Insta false accounts - a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news highlighted concerns about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
20% of students reported managing a clean "main" account to show their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who accidentally fell on the secret site of her 13 - year - old daughter discovered a teenager who encouraged others to “violate me. ”
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of young people from 11 to 18 years of age have a double profile, half of students who acknowledge having private accounts.
The head of the CSM Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are being tried to create online places where parents and teachers do not find them."
Elid Doyle will represent the athletes at the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Elid Doyle was elected to the Management Board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics, and President Ian Beattie described this choice as an excellent opportunity for the leaders of this sport to take advantage of his vast experience at the international level these ten years.
"Eilid is highly respected in the Scottish, British and World Athletic community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would greatly benefit from its participation in the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I really want to be the voice of athletes and I really want to be able to make my contribution and lead this sport in Scotland."

I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I would recover or at any point.
It was a trialful job, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again, and today I do agility exercises!

Online advertising on milk that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertising of a company offering a milk shot compares nursing mothers to cows during trafficking.
In order to mark the launch of what is called "first silent milk shooting in the world", Elvie, a large public technology company, has launched a bold advertising inspired by a musical video clip to show the freedom that its new milk shooting offers to nursing women.
In a cow farm full of hay, four real mothers dance at the rhythm of a song whose words are: "Yes, I'm betraying myself, but you don't see a tail" and "In case you didn't notice it, it's my breasts, not women."
The refrain continues: "Spring it, pump it, I feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, I help women with milk."
However, advertising, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received conflicting reactions from the public, many of whom say it sheds light on the "hours" of the dairy industry.
"A worse decision than using cows to promote this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken away in the days that follow their birth," one of them wrote.

Another commented: "It is an understandable trauma for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to make the announcement of a milk shot for mothers who keep their baby?"
Someone else added: "An advertisement so disconnected."
Others defended advertising, such as a woman admitting that she found the song "hilarant".
"I think it's a genius idea.
I'd have bought one if I was still in the process.
Pomper gave me the impression of being a cow.
Advertising is a little dirty, but I took it for what it was.
It's a great product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "It's a fun advertisement for mothers who take their milk (usually at their place of work or in the toilets) and feel like cows."
It is not advertising that commends the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women reveal that they have danced with the discreetly unscrupulous milk-scattered in their support-gorge.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use milk are said to have the impression of being cows.
However, Elvie's milk shoot is completely silent, without children or tubes and is discreetly immersed in a milking bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their baby, and even get out while milking.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother commented: "The Elvie milk shot is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a funny and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new milk will provide.
It's not the first time Elvie's milk is made one of the newspapers.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared on the stage of designer Marta Jakubowski while she used this product.
Hundreds of migrants settled quietly in a camp on the border of Texas
The number of migrant children detained has greatly increased, although the number of monthly crossings at the borders has remained relatively stable, partly due to the fact that Trump administration's severe speeches and policies have made it difficult to complicate children's placements among respondents.
Traditionally, most respondents were themselves paperless immigrants and were afraid of compromising their own ability to stay in the country by bringing about a child's rescue.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their home should submit their fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Service, witnessed last week before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had made an application for unaccompanied minors' sponsorship.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees had no legal precedent.
"Approximately 80% of respondents or family members are illegal here, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people," said Mr. Albence.
According to refugees, in order to treat the case of children more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules that will impose on some of them to appear before the court in the month following their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard.
Many of them will be compared by videoconferencing, rather than by anyone, to plead their case with regard to their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons deemed to be ineligible will be expelled quickly.
According to stakeholders and reports submitted in recent months by the shelter network, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
In a large institution such as Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that the signs indicating that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be neglected because of its size, according to the rights defenders of the child.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare themselves emotionally or to tell their friends about it could accentuate a trauma that many have trouble managing.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw to the field.
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Walid al-Mouleem, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Mouleem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on the Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that they would "be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Mouleem argued that "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, while more than 360 000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions of others have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus was going to "run this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed" of both the two terrorist groups and any "foreign illegal presence".
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, most of which are formed and advise both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bachar al-Assad.
In this war-damaged country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers in place.
Mouleem said about refugees, that the conditions were favourable for their return, and accused "some Western countries" of "producing irrational concerns" that prevented refugees from returning.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns easier," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have indicated that there would be no support for the reconstruction of Syria as long as a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war would not be concluded.
United Nations diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last rebel stronghold of Idlib has led to further political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale attack on the province where three million people live, by the Syrian forces supported by Russia.
Mouleem, however, pointed out that the agreement provided for "precise times" and hoped that military measures would target the jihadists, in particular the combatants of the Nusra Front, who are related to Al-Qaeda and who will "be eliminated".
Staffan de Mistura, representative of the United Nations, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee to gather members of the government and opposition to prepare a post-war constitution and prepare the way for the elections in Syria.
Mouleem defined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee, stating that the work of the group should be limited to "the revision of the articles of the current constitution", and formulated a warning against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as there is no doubt that many liberal TVs, the resignation and scandal lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
What would certainly be "The most spectacular end of a presidency!"
At this time, the public showed no sign of fatigue.
Since 2014, scores at peak hours have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and almost tripled, amounting to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at large listening hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC's "Rachel Maddow Show", which reaches 3.5 million viewers at large evenings, is the first cable television channel.
"It's a matter that attracts people because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, a presentation of the ABC's dramatic series "designated Survivor" who speaks of a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a coroned comedian author and author of "Just the Funny Parts : And some irrefutable truths about moving into the Hollywood Boys' Club," he has another theory for his part.
She recalls taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? She asked him.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
Chaos has a funny value.
Obviously, contrary to what is happening on television, Washington's scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can meet together and the health of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most fortunate viewers can afford.
However, this is far more than the fact that a citizen is informed when one meets for six hours a panel of experts discusses how Bob Woodward has used a "deep know-how" for his book "Fear", on the leather coat at $15,000 of Paul Manafort's "a clothing full of pride" according to Washington Post, and the consequences of the extravagant descriptions that Stormy Daniels has delivered from, uh, Mr. Trump's anatomy.
On my side, I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
"If part of what he does makes it feel like watching a television show, it's because he makes you take advantage of something every night," said Brent Montgomery, Director General of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of "Pawn Stars" about changing teams and Trump's daily situation returns (fighting with the NFL, congratulate Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode unless we're on the train.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was standing inside looking at MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not stand aside, not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was preparing to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember the time when we animated all these crazy emissions and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money from the outside invades the most closed elections of the mid-term
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is flooded with money, thanks to a re-adjustment of the Congress districts that allowed two holders to argue in the same seat.
The district of Pittsburgh, which has recently been restructured, is the seat of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who has desecrated its seat in another constituency during the special elections in the past spring.
Lamb is measured to another holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily facing the new 17th district.
The cards were redesigned when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the former roundabouts were unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The new 17th district race led to a confrontation with the financing of electoral campaigns between the major funding sectors of the parties, the Committee of Congress on the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Committee on the Republican Campaign (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a victory of justice last March during a very popular special election in the 18th district of the Congress of Pennsylvania.
This seat was held by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the victory in the district by 20 points.
Politologists have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States planned to penalize Salvador for its support for China, then withdrew
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington had not opposed.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
Representatives of the Department of State decided to convene the heads of US diplomatic missions in Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest against "their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, at the beginning of the month in a communiqué.
However, sanctions were only provided against Salvador, which received US aid estimated at $140 million in 2017, in particular to control drugs and provide development and economic support.
The sanctions envisaged, including reductions in financial assistance and visa-oriented restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
While the internal meetings were continuing, North American and Central American representatives delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting held last year, which was perceived as an advance in efforts to prevent immigrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior officials of the administration clearly indicated that they wanted the conference to continue, thus ending any consideration of sanctions against the Salvadoran people.
The Vice-President Mike Pence now eight expressed himself at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, informed the diplomats.
And the three American broadcasters returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new severe messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson for Mr. Bolton at the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate that had been described by the three American dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions under the cover of the anonymity.
Their speech was corroborated by an independent analyst near the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Study history
The next tuile could be the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the possible impediment to Mr Trump's justice. The public record is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also direct his inquiry into the question of a convenient campaign of Mr. Trump with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress control changes hands, Mr. Trump will find himself in the obligation to report to this body, at a time when he is ready to represent himself before the electors and perhaps before a jury composed of his peers.
There are many 'if' here, and I do not claim that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - or that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to take on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, the German officers were about to hold a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had held him head-on and retired the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and there was an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these cliffs and the irrevocable march of democracy accelerates or is delayed.
The Americans are currently confronted with a number of these claws.
What if Mr. Trump refers the deputy to Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since he reported that, last year, he proposed to register the president in secret and issued assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the report of the Times was incorrect.
"What if the recent FBI investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial - or if it is committed to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress asking for accounts for Mr. Trump?
If we do not succeed in these trials, democracy will be a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, which had occupied my former residence as an ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America, and, sixty years later, sent me out to light candles from the Sabbath on the table tree.
With this legacy, I cannot be optimistic about our future."

Graham Dorrans des Rangers, trusting in the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna Thursday, while knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive zero match in Spain against Villareal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a strong position to qualify for Group G in the League of Europe.
A knee injury has deprived Graham Dorrans of his first participation in the season until the match zero 2:2 against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to make the best of such a result to achieve exploits.
"It was a positive point for us, because Villareal is a quality team," said the 31-year-old attacker.
"We got into the game by thinking about getting something and we're dealing with it with a point.
We might have been able to bring it to an end, but, overall, a zero match was probably a fair result.
They were probably better at the first half and we got back in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday, this is another important European evening.
With a little luck, we can hope to get three points, but this will be a difficult match because they made a good result during their last match, but I'm sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really difficult, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there is a satisfactory factor in this place now.
The team is good and the boys have a lot of fun; training is of quality.
Let's hope to go ahead now, leave the last season behind us and triumph."
Women no longer find sleep because of this fear of their savings-retirement
Although the participants in this survey knew clearly how they wanted to be cared for, few people raised the issue with members of their families.
Nearly half of those who participated in the national study reported that they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said that they had talked to their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do what they need to have this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the National Life Insurance Branch.
Here's where to begin.
Talk to your spouses and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these fees.
Your long-term care financing decisions may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with value of purchases to help you cover these expenses or other insurance on your property - provided that you have the means to ensure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles on the move.
Provide a health care service that will allow you to designate a trusted person who will check your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also a commission regarding your financial resources.
You will choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure payment of your invoices if you are affected by incapacity.
Think about the details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and he goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.

A man has been injured several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received several shots fired with a compressed air rifle when he would come back from a party.
The victim, who was forty years old, was in the Oxford Grove region in Ilfracombe, in Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
The police described the incident, which took place around 2:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries did not threaten his life, and the police called witnesses.
Seismes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, announced the authorities, and the balance should be settled.
Since the communications were paralysed, the relief services were unable to receive any information from the Dongala Regency, an area located in north Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of magnitude 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
A few essential facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, whose population was estimated to be 379 800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Dongala is a region of the island of Sulawesi, located more than 300 km (180 miles) north-west coast.
The population of the region, an administrative region below a province, was estimated to be 299 200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the province of Sulawesi central, and especially of the coastal region of Dongala.
The extraction of nickel is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been affected by tsunamis for several times over a century, according to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Reduction.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also struck west of Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Sismic Fire Circle and is regularly drained by seismic droughts.
Here are some of the main droughts and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake, which occurred on 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, making 226,000 victims on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: Several violent seismics swept the west coast of Sumatra in late March at the beginning of April.
A few hundred people died on the island of Nias, off Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6,8 magnitude reached the south of Java, Indonesia's most inhabited island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and made nearly 700 victims.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake swept the city of Padang, capital of the province of Sumatra West.
More than 1,100 people have been killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake devastated one of Mentawai islands along Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A surface seismic earthquake devastated the reign of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding the inhabitants of the devastating earthquake and the deadly tsunami of 2004.
No tsunami has been triggered this time, but more than 100 people have been killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Important seismics have taken over the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of temporarily blocked tourists.
The elderly son of Sarah Palin arrested for marital violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for the Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for aggression.
Palin, 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was questioned for suspicion of marital violence, which was contrary to a report of marital violence and resistance to arrest, according to a communiqué published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he would have taken the phone of a female knowledge who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is placed in temporary detention in Mat-Su's temporary detention centre and is held unsecuredly of $500, KTUU said.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, it is certain" when his complainant was asked, announced the network.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means he could be sentenced to imprisonment for up to a year and is liable to a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of having committed a class B minor offence, punishing a day of imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges are brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report this alleged aggression.
The case is pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with marital violence, interference in the report of a sexual violence and possession of a weapon in connection with the incident.
His companion claimed he had hit him on the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking the violent behavior of her son with the PTSD resulting from her service in Iraq.
Seism in Indonesia: several hundred deaths
At least 384 people died following the earthquake that devastated the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and ravaged thousands of houses.
The electricity and telecommunications networks are in progress and the victim's balance should be taken into account in the coming days.
The seism was declared just north of the centre of Sulawesi, north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Video broadcasts on social media show the impact point.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami broke out on the coast.
Federal prosecutors call a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutors of New York are asking for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged attacker of New York who has committed eight victims - a rare punishment that has not been applied in that State for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old, would use a rented truck at Home Depot to attack a cyclable track on the West Side Highway, in Lower Manhattan, on his pedestrian road and a cyclist in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to provide evidence that Saipov has "intendedly" murdered the eight victims and "intendedly" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to seek the capital punishment filed with the South District of New York.
These two charges are possible to train the death penalty, according to the legal document.
A few weeks after this aggression, a large federal court condemned Saipov from 22 prosecution officers, eight of whom were charged with murder for extermination of funds, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and car destruction.
The attack required "a minor preparation and pre-medication", said prosecutors, qualifying the method used by Saipov for "hate, cruel and deplorable".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," said the intentional statement.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The South District of New York had not claimed the death penalty in the context of prosecutions for ten years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case, it was in 1953 in the case concerning Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed for conspiracy and espionage for the USSR during the two years following the cold war.
Both Rosenberg were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, who originated in Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months following the tragedy, according to courtrooms.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was pleased with his actions.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been urged to commit the attack after watching Daesh videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked Daesh to display the flag in his hospital room, specified the police.
He complained that he was not guilty of 22 counts of charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, stated that he was "evidently disappointed" with the decision to try to prosecute.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty rather than to accept his plea of guilt and to condemn him to life imprisonment without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma related to these events for all concerned," Patton said.
The Saipov defence team had already asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
A Conservative Member said that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the popular army" during a demonstration at the conservative conference.
The former UK Independence Party indicated that politicians had to " feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's Members suggested, it should be responsible for negotiating with the EU.
The Conservative rear-view MP Peter Bone said during the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom "would have already been released" if Mr. Farage had been secretary in Brexit.
But the dilemma that Mrs May faced in reconciling her deeply divided troops was emphasized by the Conservatives in favour of the idea of staying in the Union that joined an isolated demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has the wrong to maintain his Chequers compromise plan despite the threats of those who want to leave and those who want to stay as well as the EU.
The Allies stressed that it would continue its efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the hostilities - and would oblige Eurosceptics and workers to choose between its programme and chaos.
Mr. Bone pointed out to the Left Mean Leave Assembly in Solihull that he wanted to "get rid of Chequers".
He felt that Mr. Farage should have become a partner and that he should be entrusted with the task of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have already been out," he said.
Wellingborough's MP added: "I will defend Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: "We have not been delivered to world wars to submit us.
We want to make our own laws in our own country. ”
Mr. Bone ignored the suggestions that public opinion has evolved since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely false."
The conservative Andrea Jenkyns, in favor of the exit, was also present at the march to tell reporters: "I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
Even though the great public is not appreciated, the opposition will not vote for it, it is also the case of our party and our militants who slam the streets and make us first and foremost elected.
Quit Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to Ms. May, she added: The Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they honor their promises."
"Mr. Farage pointed out to the assembly that politicians should be brought to " feel pressure" if they were about to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
They're trying to fool Brexit, and we're telling them today, "We're not going to let you out like this."
He added in a message addressed to the enthusiastic crowd: "I want you to feel the pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilize the popular army of this country that has enabled us to win the victory in Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud UK."
Meanwhile, pro-European fans walked through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour relationship in the city centre.
A small number of militants branded conservative banners against Brexit after the group was launched this weekend.
His workman, Lord Adonis, was horrified by the security issues regarding the party's implementation at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the ones that assure us that they are able to put in place computer systems and all technology for Canada, plus, for the free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a real farce.
A good Brexit, it doesn't exist," he added.
Warren intends to consider seriously the possibility of presenting himself to the presidential elections
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed his future on Saturday at a public assembly in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a often critical vote with regard to President Donald Trump, is presented for the November election against Geoff Diehl, a representative of the GOP in the States, who was co-chaired in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It was at the centre of speculation that could deal with Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters at a public assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked if she intended to present herself to the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which meant having a woman at the head of the state."
Arrest at the death by dance of Sims of the State University of Louisiana
On Saturday, Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the death by ball of the basketball player Wayde Sims, a LSU basketball player, on Friday.
Baton Rouge's police service participated in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at 11.00 H.E. Press conference.
Friday, they had published a video of the shooting, asking for help to identify a man who was on the images.
Sims, 20 years old, was killed by a ball Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims received a head-to-head injury and collapsed to his injuries," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday at 247 sports.
Wade took his friend's defense and was killed by Simpson.
Questioned, Simpson admitted to being in the places, in possession of a weapon, and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody for the police service of the East Baton Rouge parish.
Yes, a 2 m young man who grew up in Baton Rouge has fought 32 games, 10 of which as a last season, and totaled on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix : Lewis Hamilton is heading to the world title after the team's guidelines enabled him to win the victory against Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became evident from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified by winning Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the instructions of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the competition.
From the pole position, Bottas took a good start and broke Hamilton on the flank while defending his place in the first two rounds, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel entered the stands first and left Hamilton to launch himself in the pulton's tailstorm, which should have been a decisive element.
Mercedes passed through the stands one round later and found himself behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the advantage after a wheeled action that saw the Ferrari pilot leave the inner part at a risk of resisting a double defense attempt in the third round.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round to celebrate his 21th birthday.
He then dominated a large part of the race, but now his tires to aim for a speedy arrival and advance Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally arrived in the stands at the 44th round, but was not able to accelerate the pace in the eight remaining rounds, Raikkonen being fourth graded.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a tremendous job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team did an exceptional job to get a two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language
At a meeting on Saturday last Saturday, President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein, who stressed that she had not revealed Christine Blasey Ford's letter that accused the candidate of sexual assault at the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly refer Ford's testimony to the Senate's judicial commission, but he argued that the events that took place in the Senate showed that people were "bad, disgusting and dishonest".
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the Senate these last days, when we see anger, when we see people who are angry and wicked and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"When they saw the disclosures and the leaks, they said, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you disclose any information?
Remember his answer... did you disclose information - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal anything."
Well, wait a minute.
We have disclosed information... No, we have not disclosed information," he added, thinking about the senator's impression.
Feinstein received the letter on behalf of Ford last July detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place early in September, but Feinstein refused to leave his office.
"I didn't discount Dr Ford's allegations, I didn't disclose his story," Feinstein told the committee, said The Hill.
"She told me to keep this confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But his denial does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented on Saturday night at the assembly: "I'll tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Following his defense of the candidate to the Supreme Court, accused of sexual assault by three women, the president let the Democrats hear that these allegations were used for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see wickedness, mercy, they get to know who they hurt, who they need to crush to get power and control," the president told Mediaite.
Elite League : Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars eliminated their defeat on Friday in Elite League against the giants of Belfast by demolishing the game back to Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the score thanks to two goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie have brought home equality before Dwyer returns the advantage to the Giants.
François Bouchard evened for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen entered two goals, guaranteeing them victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in Elite League for the players of Adam Keefe, who had fought Dundee 2-1 Friday night in Belfast after being arrested.
It was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two camps, the Giants having triumphed in the last three matches.
Dwyer took the advantage of the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a passage by Kendall McFaul, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the four minutes later.
During the first well-charged period, Sullivan resumed the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt went on to serve Cownie, at 15:16, with an equalization.
Dwyer ensured the advance of the Giants before the first break when he hit his second goal of the evening toward the end of the first period.
The local team met and Bouchard once again equaled with a goal giving a digital advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen place Dundee in the head for the first time from the match at the end of the second period, thus ensuring the victory of his team by marking a fifth goal at the mid-course.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, will welcome Milton Keynes during their next game Friday.
An air traffic controller died helping hundreds of people on board an aircraft to escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is greeted in heroes after death by ensuring that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people can safely disembark.
More than 800 people are dead and many others are gone after an important earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to destroy the region, and a large number of people are trapped under demises in the city of Palu.
But despite the flight from his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the violently displaced tour at the airport of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri of Palu.
It remained on the ground to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, could safely take off.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt it would collapse.
He died at the hospital later.
Yohannes Sirat, the spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that this action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian news.
We mobilized a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our heart is broken to learn this," he added.
The authorities are concerned that the number of deaths can reach thousands, the disaster prevention agency of the country indicating that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance sheet would continue to stand out because many bodies were still under the debris and a large number could not be safe," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the agency.
Waves measuring up to six meters have ravaged Palu, which will celebrate a Sunday mass burial.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "At every minute, an ambulance lifts the body.
Clean water is rare.
The mini-markets are pillaged everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, responsible for the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is short to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Joko Widodo, Indonesia's president, arrived at Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's soldiers: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?' said CNN.
Indonesia was excavated earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Aviation accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man has disappeared after the crash of a plane in the lagoon.
The airline that operated the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that a man has been taken away, after 47 passengers and crew members safely evacuated the plane that flowed.
Air Niugini said in a communiqué that since Saturday afternoon, she was unable to find the trace of a male passenger.
The airline reported that it collaborated with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man in question.
The airline did not respond immediately to more specific requests for information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local vessels took part in the rescue of other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water trying to land at Chuuk airport.
The authorities stated on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline claimed Saturday that six passengers were still at the hospital, and that they were all in a stable state.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of the events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the aircraft had landed in the lagoon near the landing track.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the track.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was getting too low.
"It's a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others had been able to slide in the water until the aircraft's rescue results were running.
he claimed that the crewmen had panicked and yelled, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Marine claimed that marines working nearby for the improvement of a quay also participated in the rescue using a pneumatic boat to transport people on the hard land before the aircraft sinks in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in accidents of air companies registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none of them concerned Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the chronology of the night the woman was burned alive
The charge updated its record on Saturday during the trial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used records of phone calls made from a mobile to trace the movements of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night the latter died.
Rowlett indicated that he had obtained location data from several mobile phones that indicated that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was at Chambers while he had pretended to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford.
Sanford compared it to the Saturday bar and testified he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he "was lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show that they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis removed the SMS, calls and coordinates of Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," Hale said.
The defense must begin its complaints on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the trial to be held before the jury in the ordinary course of the day.

A trio hip hop wants to deduce the negative vision of the genre by impregnating its music of positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hip hop has distanced itself from its origins of political messages and social problems.
The group wants to renew with its roots and make the hip political hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have experienced a recent resurrection in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another Black?!
A New York bride pursues a couple in court for having fired her after a "racist" text
A New York bride pursues a couple in court for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message transmitted by the mother who complained that she was "another Black".
The couple refuses to be racist, and assimilates the prosecutions to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her condolences in 2016, finding that Giselle Maurice, the new nun, was Black at her arrival for her first working day.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON ENCORE ONE NOIRE," wrote Ms. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding her pocket, "bad at ease", Plasco-Flaxman referred to Ms. Maurice, explaining that their former nephew, who was Afro-American, had done a bad job and that she was expecting a Philippines instead.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a working day, then returned to her home by a Uber.
Now, Maurice pursues the couple in court in order to obtain compensation for her resignation and claims a compensation of $350 per day for the six-month household service for which she was initially hired, but without contract.
"I want them to understand, listen, we don't do this kind of thing," she explained at the Post Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple replied to the allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to put an end to Maurice's employment, fearing that she would not be able to trust him after having done him harm.
"My wife sent him something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco said at the Post.
"But do you trust your children to someone with whom you have been immoral, even if it was wrong?
Your new-born?
Let's go! ”
Assembling the trial to a "extortion", Plasco claimed that his wife was only two months old when she had a baby and was in a "very delicate situation".
"Would you follow someone like that?
This is not a very pleasant thing to do," the business banker added.
While the case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has not hesitated to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behaviour and logic.
The editors of Paddington were afraid that the readers would not identify themselves to a bear that spoke, revealing a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said about this letter: "It is difficult to replace someone who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It's very funny, knowing what we know about the huge success of Paddington."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a small bear in battle, would remain optimistic about the rejection of his work. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books had a "sweet-sweet" taste after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important member of our family”, adding that her father was very proud of her final success.
"He was a pretty calm man, and he wasn't a pretender," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds something: we are proud of him, even though it is not really his own achievement.
I think he saw the success of Paddington that way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
At the landing, his daughter had been rushed to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to explain to us how bad the situation was, we didn't expect it to happen," said Ednan-Laperous.
"Then Nad called me to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I should say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors had given him to maintain heart rate were slowly draining and getting out of his system.
She was dead a while ago and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't listen, I couldn't cry, I couldn't cry, I couldn't cry, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to take the shot."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, in mourning for her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the test she was going through.
"No one was aware," she said.
"I had my head down, and I would cry all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's during the flight that I've experienced this great sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grief women deposit postcards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide are trying to prevent others from enjoying life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys displayed, on a galloon bridge, postcards containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I'm forced to feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, aged 45 and staying at Lydney, said that her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up any room."
However, he quit his job before he died, since he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, it was Tyler's brother, then 11-year-old, who found his brother after he had killed himself.
Ms. Davis said, "I am constantly afraid that there is a training effect."
Ms. Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can go see and to whom you can talk, even if he is a friend.
Don’t be silent - you have to talk. ”
Mrs. Humphreys, a long-standing friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He did not say that he felt down, depressed or otherwise," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we found his attitude change.
He was at the bottom of Christmas - when the children opened their presents, he had no visual contact with them or anything."
She pointed out that her death was an enormous trauma to them, but they had to get out of it: "It's disgusting for the family.
It destroys us.
But we all have to go ahead and beat us."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is under way as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what he asked - a limited investigation in time, limited in its scope - we might be able to bring some unity," said Mr. Flake Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would "do away" in a partial impasse.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republicans not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reticence is due to the choice of the moment.
The mid-term elections will take place only in five weeks, or on 6 November. If, as planned, the Republicans make a bad score, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to make the man they want to choose at the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush dropped the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through him, his wife Ashley, who was then his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI presents its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
We do not yet know if Mr. Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to leave the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: the number of "fall" deserters under Kim's direction
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has decreased since the accession to the power of Kim Jong-un, seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Department of Southern Unity, stated that 1,127 desertions had taken place last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increased tariffs claimed by the passengers were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comments.
The vast majority of North deserters will eventually be granted South Korean nationality.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most fled China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters as clandestine migrants rather than refugees and often repatriates.
The relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang in the framework of the nuclear negotiations that had so far been suspended.
This took place after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-one in Singapore, during which they agreed to work for a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong-ho has charged US sanctions with the lack of progress ever since.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to operate unilateral disarmament," said Mr. Ri in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", and claims that he is unfit to sit at the Supreme Court
Pelosi, leader of the parliamentary minority, nominated the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh of "hysterical" and stated that he was unworthy to sit at the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi made these comments during a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I could not help but think that if a woman had acted in this way, they would have treated her as "hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate court committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, with emotion, denied the allegations that he would have sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and sometimes failed to scream and gloat, calling out his family and his years of high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats sitting in the committee, calling the allegations about "gross murder and coordinated" organized by the disappointed liberals that Hillary Clinton had lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi stated that according to her, Kavanaugh's testimony showed that it was not right to sit in the Supreme Court, since it demonstrated that it was against the Democrats.
"I think he disagrees with these statements and the way in which he took them to Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when he was asked whether she would try to replace Kavanaugh if it had been confirmed, and whether the Democrats had obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he does not tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, he is not only unworthy to sit in the Supreme Court, but also unworthy to sit in the court where he is at present," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is the judge of the DC Circuit Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about any decisions of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since it is considered a conservative judge.
During his discharge hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh ignored the question of the possible reversal of certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and partial person to go to court and wait for what we say: "it's not wonderful," said Pelosi.
And women must use it.
It's a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger, and it can't get her out without crying.
"We are crying when we fail," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, and you?"
"I was greatly helped by a woman who was in the middle of something, who told me that she would also cry when she was angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she was angry and crying: "You can think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I found it brilliant."
The tears are allowed as excruciating wrath, in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my most remarkable memories of a first job, in an office dominated by men, where I had one day found myself crying out of an unexpressable rage, was that I had been caught by the skin of the neck by an old woman - a cold director who had always a bit of terror - who had led me to a ladder.
"Don't let them see you crying" she told me.
“They don’t know that you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they're rabid because they've had you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential election.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart had been caught in an extra-conjugal case on board a boat called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said that there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of presenting herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a very thoughty decision," she told me by laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in high school, and the last thing they missed was an extra person.
Someone called it "Blanche-Neige and the Seven Nains".
As the campaign was very advanced, it had been late in the fund collection, and therefore swore that it would not participate unless it had collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who normally gave $1,000 to men were counting on her to give her only $250.
"Do they think I'm entitled to a rabbi?" she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was upset by her emotions - gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration against the system that made it so difficult to collect funds and target voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism - that she felt it strange.
"You would have thought I was a nervous depression," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about the reaction of the press to her.
“You would have thought that Kleinex was my sponsor.
I remember being asked what they were going to put on my gravestone.
"Did she cry?"
How trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first escapes of the trade war between the United States and China were overwhelming, and although the battle was far from over, a disagreement between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important increase occurred this week with new customs duties affecting items worth $200 billion (150 billion sterling books), thus taxing half of all goods coming from China to the United States.
Each time, Beijing returned to nature, with a recent increase in customs duties of between 5 and 10 per cent of US$60 billion.
China has committed itself to equalizing the United States, and it is unlikely that the second largest world economy will be free of bribery.
To withdraw Washington is to surrender to the demands, but publicly surrendering to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts believe that if Beijing can play its role properly, the pressures of the American trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can bring about favourable conditions for economic slowdown in one country or another is in fact much more dangerous than what observers previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research partner focusing on Asia, to the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria is committed to the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild this country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, said that the situation in the country would improve.
"Today, the situation on the spot is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The Government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now being met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees in the country they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations believes that more than 5.5 million Syrians have devastated the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would favour the reconstruction of this devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries that assisted the insurrection.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 by beating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in the National Golf near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the title when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team broke the bar of 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was in trouble during the major part of the tournament, sunk his departure into the water at the 16th hole by 3 and moved his duel to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has been excellent in all its rounds, becoming one of the four players who have never reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, the first edition of which dates back to 1979.
The American Jordan Speeth was separated 5-4 by the player at least well placed by the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The best golfer in the world, Dustin Johnson, turned 2 and 1 in front of the Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the European champion of all time with a total of 25.5 career points.
"In general, I don't cry, but today, it's stronger than me.
It was a moving year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to recover the cup.
What matters is the team, and I am happy to have been able to help it," Garcia said with emotion after the European victory.
He passed the flamingo to his compatriot John Ram who won the legend of American golf Tiger Woods 2-1 in simple, last Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride, I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this guy," said 23 years old Rahm.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 careers in Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistics for one of the biggest golfers of all time, which has decimated 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a hard time finding the fairway all week, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk commented after a disillusioned performance about his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they're beaten.
This morning, we had a moment when we put pressure on Europe.
We left.
Hats in Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Its 12 players have all played very well.
We're going to group together, I'm going to work with the U.S. PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going ahead.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
We need to get on with it.
We're getting over it."
